subject1113,"    I'm 19, almost 20. I use they/them pronouns and just live my life the way that I want to. Some days I might wear a dress and other days I might wear jeans.     The Perks of Being A Wallflower, Go Ask Alice and The Bell Jar. I read them a lot when I was in high school     It means that my gender identity isn't male or female.     Fahrenheit 451 is one of my favourite books. I can't recommend it enough  Hi, 19/nb/Ireland looking for someone to chat with  [removed]  I am an autistic non binary person. AMA        That autistic isn't an insult     People online when I say there's more than two genders     Ordering food, coffee     Did you know most of the autistic community doesn't want a cure?     Did you know that getting pregnant increases the chance of your child having autism?      ""A boy on the cusp of manhood can't spend the whole day whackering"" To Rebecca Sugar     Well one of the side effects of concerta is loss of appetite which isn't good because I have to remind myself to eat. A few side effects of prozac at the start were headaches and nausea but they have gone away now. Before the medication I was able to focus but not on things I found boring, I had a lot more impluses to do things and my mind would just be racing all the time. I also had mood swings where I'd go from one extreme to the other and I had a lot of anxiety.     Imma likin' da prozac soo much dudez      I feel attracted to other genders like female and non binary. I'm attracted to femininity.     Don't you think that maybe a man won't go through all that trouble to prev on people? There is literally nothing stopping a man from walking into a woman's bathroom and doing anything, do you think a law is going to stop him?      I try to go for an androgyne look, but I do look quite feminine so it's hard to find a balance.      Why do you support it?     I was assigned female at birth. A lot of the time people do give me shit because I'm too 'tumblr' for them but I know a lot of other non binary people so that's cool. Having autism can kind of turn people off because I don't really understand social cues and I'm not as socially aware as other people my age, so that caused a lot of isolation and bullying when I was in secondary/high school.  Looking for some creepy/horror plays to read over the summer.  I study theatre in college and the plays that are on my course are okay but I prefer something that will creep me out or something spooky. I especially love creepy dolls, yandere type characters and gore.      It hurts being referred to as female but I'm always feel nervous correcting people, even though I know I shouldn't be. What I can tell you as a person who doesn't believe in gender topics is to just accept people for who they are and use gender neutral language just in case.      Yes, but vaccines do not cause autism. As for my favourite tick, I don't know.     I just try to ignore them or just let them be. There's no point in wasting my energy on people like that.     That's not a question.      What's your favourite pair?     That's not a question and I was actually diagnosed with autism when I was sixteen. But I don't like using labels like high functioning or low functioning because autism is a lot more complex than that. I go to college, I'm verbal and I can type etc, so I must be high functioning. But I also have problems with picking up social cues, sometimes I forget how to talk, I have problems with personal hygiene, I'm unable to live on my own and I have meltdowns, so I must be low functioning.        Lol I am and I'm fine with that haha :-)     Nah I rather not.     By supporting that law, are you saying that men are a danger to women and children?     Yeah, obviously. The world doesn't look too kindly on autistic people, especially adults.      Dude, I think I know myself a lot better than you. I know I'm autistic and I'm fine with that. I'm not labeling myself, I'm just comfortable with who I am. Plus if you want to be taken seriously you shouldn't use the word r*tard, just saying.     I don't know really, when I started to go through puberty really. I didn't feel like my body belonged to me and that I didn't fit in with boys or girls. It took me a long time to realise that I was non binary because I never heard of being transgender.      I really like your comment :-)     Yes     Yeah I stim a lot. It's usually when I'm nervous but I also stim when I'm really excited. My leg bounces up and down and when I'm nervous I pick at my nails. I do have a tumblr, playfulghost.tumblr.com :-)     Yes     I love drama and theatre :-) My favourite animal is an owl or a cat. My favourite game is Undertale and the thing I like most about it is the soundtrack.      Haha a binary joke    Are you fighting for the rights for trans men, men of colour, disabled men or is Men's Rights just about how horrible the friendzone and how feminazis are ruining your life?       Steven Universe is that you?     Same, everyone thinks I'm weird.  Society should learn to accept autistic people instead of trying to find a cure.  If you don't know what autism is, it is basically a neuro developmental disorder and is characterised by difficulties with social interaction, verbal and non verbal communication and restricted and repetitive movements. What I am saying here is that people should accept autism as a different way of seeing the world and not as a disease. Autism should be something that is celebrated instead of anti vaxxer moms posting online about how they 'cured' their autistic child by giving them a gluten-free, sugar-free organic diet. Having autism is not the worst thing to happen to someone, organisations like Autism Speaks shouldn't spread fear and act like autistic people are puzzles that need to be fixed.  Help me find my twin!       You seem very bitter... bad day?      Well I'm apparently on the ""high"" end of the spectrum which is pure bullshit because autism isn't a binary of low and high functioning, it's a spectrum, hense the name! But I do have problems with stimuli and instead of disrepecting or ridculing the person, we should try and make the world better or less stressful. It is not their fault that the world is sometimes too much to handle, they didn't do anything to be that way so we should try and understand that person and give them ways to cope with those problems.      I have been around autistics, I am autistic and some of my best friends are. The kids you saw there, the reason they screamed when they were touched is because sometimes for autistics being touched physically hurts and people have boundaries that need to be respected. Also grown men playing with crayons is not part of having autism and could be a different disability. Have you ever had depression? I'm curious because I have both autism and depression and depression is so much worse than autism. Depression is for the most part life long, you can learn ways to cope with depression and take medication but depression is to do with how your brain is wired and that is life long.      Well I self censored the word because I really don't like that and I know a lot of people like it either. It's an awful word. How is autism an undesirable medical condition? Autistic people are actually very talented and intelligent, we just have difficulties in things that come natural to neurotypicals
     But it is a neuro developmental disorder, it can't be cured. To cure someone with autism is taking away their personality and what makes them unique. A huge part of the autistic community don't want to be cured.     I feel like this is an unpopular opinion among autistic people.      Except Autism isn't a disease like AIDS etc and how am I r*tarded for thinking that autistic people deserve to be treated with respect.      Your beard is magical 3 6/10     You're so cute, I love your hair :-) 9/10     Why would you touch someone when they don't want to be touched?     Hi I'm also a feminist, what is your opinion on trans women? I know a lot of feminists are against trans women because they aren't 'real' women.      No I don't want to forcefully change the way people inhabit the planet, I want to help people who struggle with problems because some neurotypicals are too selfish to listen to autistic people and chose to instead listen to bullshit from Autism Speaks. Autistic people are human beings and deserve to be treated as one, society is just so obsessed with fixing anything that doesn't fit in with the norm and blaming people for having problems. You're saying that it is better to eliminate autism, a neuro developmental disorder that can't be cured, than to actually look at the world and try and change it for the better. I think that's pretty selfish.     Oh god no, I was diagnosed when I was sixteen. I'd never take a label that I knew wasn't mine.      They do. It took a while to find antidepressants that worked for me, the first type I took didn't help and I had a bad reaction to them. But now I have less depressive thoughts and suicidal urges.      You do know blind people and mute people exist right? And that there are people that live normal lives with HIV and AIDS.   I am on ADHD medication and antidepressants. AMA!  Hi so I take concerta, which is medication for ADD/ADHD. I was diagnosed with ADD when I was 16 but only started taking it when I was 17. I'm 19 now and in college. I also take Prozac for depression. Just to let you know that I was given the prescription by my doctor and take them as they should be taken i.e once a day.     How does that relate to autism?     I love your eyes and you look like you take really good care of your hair :-) 8/10     You're so beautiful :-) 10/10      I'm 19, almost 20.

subject1637," Any tips to improve essay writing speed?  I'm apparently a very slow writer, because I didn't finish my essay this time. After 1 minute of planning, I began writing non-stop until the proctor said, ""pencils down."" In the end, I wrote a page and a half.

So how can I improve that? I'm working to make my essays better in other ways, but how can I write quicker and fill up more space?  What am I doing wrong on essays?  I took the SAT twice, got an 8 both times. None of the guides or tips I find online have helped. So I took a 25 minute practice essay, with a prompt I found online. Can anyone identify my mistakes?

Prompt:
""That which we obtain too easily, we esteem too lightly. It is dearness only which gives everything its value."" -Thomas Paine

Do we value only what we struggle for? Plan your response, and then write an essay to explain your views on this issue. Be sure to support your position with specific points and examples. (You may use personal examples or examples from your reading, observations, or, knowledge of subjects such as history, literature, science.)



People only value what they struggle for. Only by overcoming obstacles can a person truly achieve. Without challenge, there can be no triumph. Without triumph, we cannot full appreciate what we have. This fundamental truth is reflected through subjects as diverse as history and literature.

Sometimes, people get something for nothing. Some people are born with money, power, and ability. King Charles I of England inherited a monarchy, and his lack of appreciation for political power caused his Parliament to turn against him in the First English Civil War. If he had struggled and fought for his position, Charles would have known he true value of the crown. This is further reflected in his successor, Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell, who refused the English crown in favor of a republic in which ""those who provide by the sweat of their brow"" can appreciate power.

A person who does not work for himself cannot appreciate his lot. George Orwell's novel, ""Animal Farm,"" was all about his shortfall of communism. The happiest of all the animals was Boxer, the horse who put in all the work to achieve his success. Because he struggled, he had a deep, honest pride in his work. Other animals, like the pigs, made no effort. Snowball took power without competition, and subsequently lost sight of the value of compromise. When Napoleon ousted Snowball, he did so by force. Neither pig struggled, and as a consequence both were unhappy and incompetent. 

Without struggle, there can be no understanding the real value of achievement. Success is measured not by raw magnitude of victory, but by resistance overcome. Nobody can appreciate the vast difficulty of a task without completing it. And there is no pride in accomplishment without conflict.  IWTL Economics  I'm really interested in learning economics, but I don't know where to begin. My High School doesn't have an economics class or club. I haven't found much online. I tried listening to Planet Money, and it's really cool, but not what I'm looking for. 

I'm a complete beginner; I've never studied economics at all, and I want to start. I want a real, basic, Economics 101 course, online or in print. A podcast would be great, but I haven't found any of what I'm trying to find on ITunes.  Why did European colonialism create such a messed up situation in Africa, but not in South America?  I look at the political map of Africa, and I cringe. So many countries, borders all screwed up, countries inside countries, etc. And Sub-Saharan Africa is generally the poorest, least developed region in the world, from my understanding.

Yet South America is similar in climate and terrain, but today a political map of South America is border porn. To me, at least, it has a beautiful division of land between just a handful of nations, and while that continent certainly has its own problems, they aren't nearly as bad as Africa's. Why is this?  What sort of extracurriculars does UVa value highly?  I'm a Hugh School Junior, and I have a wide variety of EC's right now, including Fencing, Model UN, Computer Science, Boy Scouts, and theatre.

I've got some free time over the summer between internships that I want to use to beef up my application. What extracurricular activities would most impress UVa admissions? Music? Volunteering? A sport?

Thanks!

EDIT: I've got a lot of great advice, thanks guys! Just wanted to elaborate a bit.

The reason I'm focusing on EC's is because my GPA is sub-par. 3.8 on a 5.0 scale, and about 3.3 unweighted. My SAT scores are near perfect, 2350. In addition, I've taken the most rigorous curriculum possible, and my school is a well-respected private institution. So the only thing that really brings me down is grades, and those are definitely improving. I just want to maximize my chances by becoming as well-rounded as possible.

I've got crappy gpa. 3.7 on a weighted 5.0 scale, and ~3.2 on a 4.0 unweighted. But my test scores are good, 2250, and, I'm taking the SAT twice more. I'm also in the process of finding a college to attend. Are there any well-respected universities that care a lot about SAT scores, and less about gpa?  I can't get into UVa  Fuck. It's my top choice for a uni. I can't get in. There's no way. Why? Because of my fucking gpa. My god damn fucking gpa. Everything else is perfect. I've taken the highest level classes my school offers. I've taken two elective AP classes. I got a 2250 on my SAT's and I'm taking them two more times. I've been an exceptional Model UN delegate since I was a freshman. TWICE I've interned for Navy engineers, PAID. I'm an Eagle Scout. And the highest cumulative gpa that a university is going to see is a 3.7. I can get a 4.5 this semester. I got a 4.1 last semester. But freshman and sophomore year I got 3.3 and 3.6. I'm so fucking upset. UVa accepts applicants with an average of 4.2 gpa. If I got a 4.0 maybe I could squeak by. But no. No matter how hard I work, I'll be fucked for college.  ""Late-game"" help? I need advice to bring my scores up from a 2250 to a 2300+.  I've checked out advice for taking the SAT given by College Board and by other test professionals, but they seem to be focused on turning average scores into good ones (~1500 to ~2000).

 But my scores are 760-740-750 Reading Math Writing. I feel like many of the normal tips and strategies wouldn't apply, like skipping all questions I'm unsure of. While that would obviously be good if I've been getting a few dozen questions wrong, in this case I only missed one or two per section. The worst of it is that all three sections are relatively even, and I don't have an 800 in any of them. Can anyone give some advice geared towards someone shooting for a perfect 2400?

I tried to get the best pictures possible. The costumer told me that it was too long in the back and around the ears. I would appreciate pictures if possible. And while I know that hair grows back, we open in less than a week. So I think a safe haircut would be served best here.

If ""1960's style"" is a silly category, let me know. I'll talk to the costumer and narrow it down. 

Thanks in advance!  What was the lineage of wealthy plantation owners in the pre-Civil War Southern US?  I have been wondering this for some time now. Were the upper-class Southern landowners descended from similarly wealthy men? Or did some impoverished families come to the New World from Europe, and eventually become the landowning, rich, powerful Southern plantation families?  Operation: Poliraft    Need help with berries  So I'm trying to make a farming hack for Emerald. I've made good progress on fixing the berry system, and I'm in the process of learning some ASM so that I can change how the clock works. But I've hit an issue with so-called ""PlantID's"". 

Naturally, a PlantID identifies which plot of land each soil event is, as they all use the same script. But I can't seem to find out how to change the properties of the PlantID's. You know how in the vanilla game you will find soil plots with plants already fully grown in them? Yeah, I'm trying to change it so that the soil plots start off empty, with absolutely nothing growing in them. Anybody know how I could do that?  Just got this cheap sweater today. How is this look?    I've gotta say, I think I prefer GA's over Crisis Committees.  I always thought I was a crisis kind of guy. But I went to two conferences in the past month, one an EU GA committee and one a semi-crisis Historical UNSC. I think I've decided that while I enjoy I enjoyed planning for them beforehand and talking about them afterward, crises are not the most fun while I'm in committee. People get silly, there are too few delegates, and I really prefer resolutions over directives. Plus, I like working with a partner to get things done; most of the other delegates at my school make excellent partners, and all of us are very versatile in our MUN talents.

I've attended at least two dozen conferences, and most of the time I made an effort to get a crisis committee. But next conference I'm going to get a GA.  Fire Department vs Riot Police  100,000 men each, in a crowded big city. They have all the equipment they would normally have, I'm proportion to their manpower. Vehicles included. Not to the death, just to rout the enemy.

EDIT: Riot Police have no firearms, only nonlethal weapons like tasers, batons, tear gas, etc.  Is there any way to recover an old email address with a forgotten security question answer?  [removed]  Something that worked for me  Been biting nails, skin and cuticles for as long as I can remember. This has been working lately.

Every day, I put a bandaid on any ""problem finger"". That means every finger with a cut, itch, dry spot, etc. It only works with a gauze-like classic bandaid, a plastic one won't work. When I have the urge to bite or pick, I bite on the bandaid. It's been doing great. The bandaids are tough enough to withstand a day of biting before completely falling apart. 

P.S. I'm a guy, in case that matters.  Are most of /r/MUN's readers College students, or High School?  I've only done MUN at the high school level, so I don't know quite how popular it is in College.  I want to have a CS major in college, but I don't know which CS major. Any help?  I'm a Junior in HS, took 2 CS classes (Honors Intro to CS, and AP CS A). I'm confident that I want to take Computer Science as a major in college. However, when I look at the majors offered by different universities, I see TONS of majors with ""Computer Science"" in the name. Examples include:

 Computer Science

 Computer Engineering (General)

Computer and Information Systems Security/Information Assurance

and

 Mathematics and Computer Science.

I really have little knowledge of the difference between these majors. Can anybody here shed some light on what these mean? If I want a job programming in the future, which one of these will be the most helpful?

EDIT: I really need to clarify here. I don't know what college I want to attend yet, just that I want a CS-type degree. So I can't very well just take CS and switch if I feel like it, because the Uni I go to might not offer what I want. I want to ensure that before I pick a college, I have a good idea of what options I want.

That said, I've pretty much been answered by now. Thanks for the input!  TV Show: In a city where all police officers are hot-headed loose cannons, one cop fights crime with a responsible regard for the rules.  Imagine it: Every cop is headstrong and reckless, except for one. When this man finds a dangerous situation, he responsibly calls for backup and waits. When a suspicious activity happens that was outside his directions, he radios back to HQ to get clearance to investigate. Other officers, whose plans consist of running into action guns blazing, are baffled at how this one man manages to consistently succeed at his job without breaking any rules or laws. 

The police chief might be another stickler for rules, and he would be very happy with the responsible cop and quite upset with everyone else. Or, the chief is also reckless, desribing the rules as ""more like guidelines."" 

Other major characters could include:

 The reckless buddy cop, who gradually is convinced that ""by the books"" actually is the best method.

The single police dispatcher, who goes unused by most of the city because the cops are always running off and disregarding rules. He/she develops a close relationship with the main character, because he is the only one who calls him/her to request backup.

A forensics expert, who is the only one in the entire forensics lab because nobody is willing to wait for the test results.

  I want to make the berry system functional in my Emerald hack. How would I do this?  Berries are regulated by the clock, which does not work in emulators. I am looking for a way to either fix the clock or make berry growth operate on another system. Any ideas?  What character personalities would you like to see in the games?  Have you thought of any interesting characters to be included in the games? I think the more recent releases lack some depth of character for the people, and I would really like to see some more fleshed-out personalities. So what traits or personalities would you like to see characters with?  Newb mod idea: Time Travel  I toyed with the thought for a while, and found [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/dwarffortress/comments/he8mw/dwarven_time_travel/) from two years ago which pretty much sums it up. Create a world, let it run for 250 years, save all the worldgen data and start playing in Adventure Mode. At some point, your character could discover/create a time travel machine, which allows it to go both back and forward in time. If it goes forward, it just saves the world data and lets the world run for the time. To travel back to the original time, it just reloads the saved world data. 

To travel back in time, the mod would recreate the world, and, using the worldgen data, let it run until the year to which you travel. Then you can experience the world of the past, and when you travel back to your original time, the mod lets the world run until that year. So you could travel back in time, change events, and return to the present to find that, maybe, that Human town didn't get destroyed by an army of Goblins because a mysterious dwarf appeared to fend them off.

And I also had a plan for dealing with your past self. The game records every action you personally make, and when you travel back two days to prevent yourself from being robbed by a kobol, your past self does exactly the same things you originally did. When that becomes impossible (like if it says that he should attack a kobol that he never met, is already dead and is buried 100 yards away), the AI assumes control of your past self. 

Would this work? Is it possible? I have a fair bit of programming experience, so I would like to work on this, but only if it has any possibility of working.

EDIT: Also, if your past self dies, you do too. It wouldn't be possible to mess with other parodoxes because time travel is impossible. So the only real caveat to messing with the past is that if your past self dies, you also do.   How could a permanent member be suspended or expelled from the Security Council?  I'm going to JHUMUNC in February, and I'm in the SC as France. The topics are pretty polarizing, and even though I have some good plans for compromise, I would like this option as a backup. I know the rules differ between conference hosts, but JHUMUNC almost completely adheres to UN Procedure. So in the real Security Council, is there any realistic plan for suspending a permanent member? Could I go to the GA for help? Is there some obscure motion for this?

EDIT: found a loophole. Resolution 2758 was a GA resolution that expelled the Republic of China (Taiwan) from the UN and accepted the People's Republic as the true representative of the Chinese nation. So to remove China, all you have to do is get the GA to repeal 2758. The PRC delegate then pretty much has to side with the West.

I imagine that in a modern committee one could do the same with Russia. A neat little loophole, eh?  I had a possible method/formula for writing mystery stories, I would like your opinion  First off, I would like to say that I haven't written anything yet (except high school essays). I just get a lot of ideas, more often for methods than for actual stories. I've been toying with a method for writing a mystery, and I wanted to put it to paper and get another opinion. The way I see it, posting to /r/writing kills two birds with one stone.

Method:

1. Write a tragedy. The tragedy should not involve the actual story's main character at all. This is because most events in mysteries are discovered rather than caused by the ""detective"". This tragedy should involve one or more deaths, several characters with clear desires, and a good heaping of dramatic irony. It doesn't have to be more than a summary of events.

2. Sketch a timeline of events for the tragedy.

3. About 1/4-1/2 of the way through the timeline pick a point for the story to begin. The point should be an event that, in the tragedy, is part of the rising action. In the mystery, it will act as the initiating event. 

4. Decide whether the detective character will witness this event, or arrive after it occurs.

5. Begin writing from the detective's perspective. There should be little-to-no exposition about anything. Assume that the readers know the tragedy, and that you are just retelling it from the detective's POV. Have the detective use the first event as a starting point, and begin investigating. The detective's story should take him to some events in the tragedy, while others he should either not know or only discover later. The detective should either be present at the tragedy's conclusion, cause it or *prevent* it. While the mystery will start off the same as the tragedy, the detective's meddling may change some parts.

I just wanted to get this out there, if you have an opinion or critique to give, great.  [WP] Tell me the story of the Angry Fireman  Never submitted a prompt before, let me know if I did something wrong, or used the wrong tag.

Details: One of my hobbies is telling really long (~15 min) stories with an extremely anticlimactic ""punchline"". I find them very fun to just make up as I tell, and refine them the more times I tell them. Usually the prompt I give myself is something like ""The [adjective] [noun]"". ""The Irish Lamppost,"" ""The Windy Barn,"" ""The Elastic Factory."" They often seem nonsensical, but I try to work them into the stories.

So, the Story of the Angry Fireman. Give it your best shot.  Need a second opinion on my outftit for a Model United Nations conference  I'm representing Ireland in an EU simulation. It's pretty much the only time I get to wear this tie, so I'm trying to keep it in the outfit.

If the number is odd, add/remove a sock from the load.  Could someone help me understand offsets, and how to work with them?  Ok, heres what I DO know and understand:

1. My computer has set aside a specific amount of 'data' for the rom. Each byte of that data is numbered in hexidecimal. Much of that data is occupied by scripts. There is also a certain amount that has no assigned value for the rom, so trying to access it without setting values for it will result in garbled gibberish. This is because there *is* information there, but it is information for other things, completely different from the rom. If I give these 'empty' bytes a value that makes sense for XSE, I can use them.

2. When I create a script, there is an offset at the beginning. This offset determines what byte the script will be stored from. So if I have a script of X bytes, and I use the offset 0x100000, the script will be stored in bytes 0x100000 to (0x100000+x).

What I need to figure out:

1. How do I stop *my* scripts from getting in the way of the scripts the rom already has? When I compile new scripts, I often get them cut off halfway through by a script that was already at that offset, resulting in the first half of my code and then a bunch of useless code written by the original designers.

2. What is a dynamic offset, and how does it differ from a normal offset? 

3. What is freespacefinder, and how does it work? If I ask it to look for, say, 200 bytes, it only gives me ~5 available offsets. Does this mean that there isn't enough free space to make a hack with more than 5 200 byte scripts?

4. Finally, a question I asked in an [earlier post](http://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonROMhacks/comments/1u76za/how_should_i_begin_making_a_completely_new_hack/): I want to start creating an entirely new hack, and the only resources from the base game I want to use will be the sprites and the basic systems. No scripts, no maps, I will make my own for all of them. How can I avoid the original scripts interfering with the scripts I write?

Thanks!  How should I begin making a completely new hack?  Hey, I've messed around with PGE, XSE and AM for a few weeks now, trying to create a rom hack. Initially I thought that the easiest thing to do would be to make only minor adjustments to the base (Emerald) and get more complex after that. However, I ended up with a bunch of garbled scripts due to offset issues, and it got really annoying. So 

I've decided to make a completely original hack, with new maps, scripts, ect. Not changing the Pokemon at all. How would I start doing this? Should I delete every map, event and script in the game, and start from there? Or is there a better way?  Why do I get a static shock when I touch my mouse?

Courier 6 came straight from the Second Battle of Hoover Dam. He's well armed, but has no allies. 

The Dragonborn came fresh from the final battle with Alduin. He has access to his shouts, magic, weapons and armor.

**ROUND TWO:**

Same as above, but with allies. Courier 6 brings the army that captured/defended Hoover Dam; battered, but very well equipped. The Dragonborn brings the full might of Skyrim's ruling army, be it Imperial or Stormcloak.

**EDIT**

Just felt that a few things needed to be clarified: in Round 2, Courier 6 gets every soldier who fought on his side at the Second Battle of Hoover Dam. The Dragonborn gets every soldier in Skyrim who is his ally. So while Courier 6 has the Bommer plane, and the BoS, the Dragonborn has on his side:

* Every Stormcloak/Imperial soldier in Skyrim (depending on his chosen side)

* The Thieves Guild, Mage College, Dark Brotherhood and the Companions

* The Blades/Greybeards (again, depending on the chosen side)

Also, in Round 1, Courier 6 has whatever he carried with him to Hoover Dam, and the Dragonborn has access to ALL shouts, spells, ect. Except maybe the Wabbajack.

EDIT: Found a fix. I was using the shortcut instead of the actual .gba file. I moved the actual file into my roms folder, and now it's fixed.  I thought /r/DIY would be the best place for this. Can anyone tell me how to restore my ~1950's box for French cards?  [Here](http://i.imgur.com/PsnU3lu.jpg) is the front and [back](http://i.imgur.com/wOrkvuF.jpg).

[One end](http://i.imgur.com/r5pGDMs.jpg) is missing the big flap and one little one.

[The other end](http://i.imgur.com/FBukkif.jpg) has both little flaps missing.

[One edge](http://i.imgur.com/whBHyTK.jpg) is coming apart in both sides, held together only in the middle.

I bought this (with the cards) at an antiques market in Paris last summer. It was in a similar condition, but the parts were all still on (they were very close to coming off). I have all the ""missing"" parts, I just need to put them back on. If this is the wrong sub, please direct me to the right one. Thanks!


  Explain the plot of Macbeth like IAMA hardcore Crusader Kings 2 player.    How does reinforcement work?  I can't get a handle on this mechanic. I can't get my levies to reinforce in the field, I have to disband them and then raise them again. My special event troops won't reinforce at all. 

I have seen AI players with armies that are very clearly reinforcing in the field. How can I do that?  Which US presidents could put up a fight against Vladmir Putin?  Fistfight, to the death. Assume each president is in their prime, even if that means they aren't currently president.

Which presidents would have the best chance at victory?  [AMA Request] An Interpol officer  **My 5 Questions:**

1. What is your average day on the job like?
2. Do you ever run into conflicts with federal/local police?
3. What was the most interesting case you've worked on?
4. Seeing that the Internet is a worldwide entity, does Interpol target internet criminals at all?
5. Do you ever feel that you violate a nation's independence by acting in some way?

**Public Contact Information:** If Applicable  What if the Schlieffen Plan targeted Russia first instead of France?  I was listening to a talk today about the beginning of WWI, and this question came to me. According to the talk, Russia's military could field more men but was less organized and less industrialized than the other European land powers (Germany and France). 

What if Germany's plan for war involved not first attacking France through Belgium, but attacking Russia and crushing them before they got their act together? Would Germany have succeeded? Would England ever join the War? America? And on which side?
  If the Democratic-Republican party were in complete control of the USA from the Constitution until the 18th Congress, what powers would each part of the government have?  [removed]  150,000 men of Napoleon's army vs the entire Roman Imperial Army commanded by Scipio  Napoleon's army consists of 150,000 men, with artillery and cavalry in good proportion. 

The Roman Imperial Army, under Augustus, contained 25 legions of about 5,000 men each, amounting to a total of 125,000 men. This army mostly consisted of heavy infantry. It also included 250 auxilia of 500 men each, composed of cavalry, archers, slingers and some heavy infantry.

So 150,000 Napoleonic troops under Napoleon vs 250,000 Roman troops under Scipio.

Edit: Scipio understands the implications of gunpowder warfare, but Romans cannot operate such weapons.   I just realized that co",1

Yes, some of his points are valid. But this is not the time and place for them.      The fuck is a bird-dog?     Ugh! On the way down on the elevator for the Eiffel Tower, this Chinese woman was literally pressing against me, even though there was plenty of room. It was also over 100*F, so I almost decked her. Boyfriend just got to stand there all with his own personal space.      Sure that wasn't /r/lacqueristasgw? Yes, that's an actual subreddit. 

As far as I know, /r/lacquerista is just a small version of this sub with like 1k subscribers and nobody ever really posting.      I love these nail sticker things. I have two packs...one goes over a nail color/design, one is polish and little metal dots. Super cute, OP!     Super pretty! Nice job. :)     Is it worth the risk?     She just said ""penis size"". I took that to mean, ""A penis that feels good in my body is the right size."" Too big for me, too small for me...either one isn't as great as someone who fits you perfectly. I'd prefer to err on the smaller size because it doesn't fucking hurt, and certain positions and other things (like toys, or whatever) can make it amazing. 

Sex is really important in a relationship, and to deny that is to be seriously deluded. 

You're coming across as really self-conscious. Maybe you should man-(or woman-)up and apologize for being a raging dickhead to her.       I'm used to being disappointed by anime endings. I still like to enjoy the ten plus hours of awesome anyway!     I just bumped Soul Eater up to the top of my ""Need to Watch"" list!     ...I'm sorry, I tried to give you an everstone to hold, but you kept dropping it. So I put it up your butt. It should come out...eventually.      How racist. How dare you assume black noise is more harmful! 

Somebody get SRS down here, stat!      And a good day to you, sir!     It's pretty fabulous.      Now **this** is high fashion. 

High on meth fashion, that is.      I'm used to being disappointed by anime endings. I still like to enjoy the ten plus hours of awesome anyway!      Ah, fair enough. I guess I really just don't care the he is getting *comment karma* or really any kind of karma because if we hadn't upvoted it, he wouldn't get karma.      Atheists don't believe in Satan, either. The point is that they believe in no mystical deities/demons fighting for possession of our so-called eternal soul. Most atheists believe that when we die...that's it. The synapses in our brain are no longer active, it's not a soul that makes a person who they are it is biology. We can pinpoint where, in the brain, someone's emotional controls are and destroy that and they may function semi-normally...and it's not like someone sucked their soul out, their brain was just damaged. 

Sorry, long-winded. Point is, atheists don't believe in Santa Claus or any other mythological character. Zeus was considered real once, too.      Wait, so is being homosexual a choice, or is acting on it a choice? Because conventional wisdom (oh, and science) says that being homosexual is not a choice. I just want to make sure you aren't being misunderstood.      Don't most of us? I feel like people are being dicks. Just because he's a dick sometimes doesn't mean we all need to jump on the OP's a Faggot Express.       Exactly. I'm constantly told by people (like my biological father) that my problems don't exist and I just want to punch him. As if I want to spend my young adult life stuck in bed when I used to be the happiest, most social person ever. 

I am terrified to piss of my parents because if they cut me off, I could lose the medical insurance through my mom. And then I'm fucking screwed.      Thank you. It's so frustrating because I can't get disability benefits or anything and my medications cost upwards of $250 a month WITH insurance. I have had friends tell me I should take legal action with the family stuff, saying its abuse, but I can't live on my own through sheer inability to support myself. Some days I'm too sick to even get up to get water. It's been fucking awful. 

I'm just so lost and in pain with no hope of getting out.      I actually use it on occasion, and it has been the ONLY thing to help my pain and that helps me sleep through the night. But I'm scared to use it because I am afraid to eat.

Edit: Also because it saps my energy and makes my brain even foggier than the fibro does. It makes it much harder to be productive. In small doses it is helpful, but I think it's still pretty hard to use.      ...I'm not sure if that's supposed to be funny but it certainly isn't helping.

Edit: and now baconlover444 is PMing me with abuse. Yay.        Haha it's okay, I don't mind. I'm just touched that you're taking the time to talk to me. I've been getting frustrated looking for resources for sick or disabled adults, but if I'm not legally disabled I can't benefit. If you're able to think of any specific resources that would be great! I don't know where to look, and it seems like Google is being purposefully obtuse and is not looking for what I need.      Seriously thank you though. I know what you're saying is true but it's so fucking terrifying. I don't know how I could possibly deal with harder living at a shelter and an even worse life right now. I feel like I'm two seconds away from snapping. I'm trying so hard to keep it all together.      I suppose. I won't be able to afford my medication and the pain will get worse. I need out but god I'm so scared. And now I'm getting shitty, abusive pms from that guy and I just want to pull my hair out and then down a bottle of pills. But I can't ask for help from them because they are sick of me.      I just don't know how many more times I can be abused before I give up. I almost did yesterday. I was sitting outside crying and my dad sat on the deck yelling sarcastic, horrible things at me while I begged him to leave me alone. But I couldn't go inside because I was going to hurt myself.       Actually I was diagnosed and treated. Anorexia nervosa diagnoses used to require a BMI of below 16.5, actually, and now the medical diagnosis guide (I can't remember the initials) altered the diagnosis requirements so, if I remember correctly, the weight standards are even more different. 

Please don't diagnose strangers on the Internet. I trust my multiple doctors, psychiatrists, therapists, nutritionists, and all of the other medical professionals that diagnosed me.      Thank you so much.      Thank you :)     Okay, thank you very much.       It's okay, just be careful about telling people with diagnosed eating disorders that they never had anorexia...it's just really triggering. You spend your entire life when you are ED-NOS striving for that anorexia diagnosis. It's the sick truth. So hearing ""oh you needed to be even less than 93 lb"" kinda sounds like ""you're a big fat faker."" I am sure you didn't mean to be offensive...it just kinda is. 


I know you're trying to help, so thank you for that. But make sure you check your facts. The recent change to the DSM-IV was that refusal to maintain a BMI below 18.5 is anorexic now.      Thank you! You're amazing.      Thank you so so much. :) that's amazingly kind.      I have a green card, but the fatigue from my fibromyalgia is one of the worst parts. So it's difficult to use marijuana unless I'm desperate. Thank you so much for the encouragement.       This sub is hard because it's very much about loving who you are *regardless of weight*, but recently it's shifted into a ""losing weight or getting 'healthy' is evil!"" sort of feel. It's why I'm not really here anymore. I lurked for a long time and basically made an account to confront people who were thin-shaming. 


While what you say is 100% true, there are some very vocal members of this subreddit that will probably flame you! It has it's positives...and also it's negatives. :) I hope you don't get flamed for this post. It's insightful and kind and nonjudgmental and empowering. :)     That's beautiful that you found a person who loves you the way you love yourself. I wish my partner hadn't told me he preferred me clean-shaven (he isn't!) because I was already self conscious about that sort of thing and now I won't even let him touch my legs if I didn't shave **that day**.  This is, obviously, my issue and not his, because we're all allowed to have preferences. I'm just not courageous enough to do it anyway.      Hair removal has kind of been a thing since we started walking upright and wearing clothes. :) I just wish it wasn't considered *disgusting* for people to have their own ideas about grooming. As long as it's affecting no one else (hygiene is a different issue, and really has nothing to do with shaving no matter how much people insist it does) it shouldn't matter.      Hmm. That's odd. 


Well, I want to say thank you for the rest of your post, it was very nice of you to reach out. And I was also not saying that I currently have an anorexic body mass, but in the past my BMI was ~15. :) I went through recovery, and they taught us that you always have anorexia. It's like being an alcoholic...you can be in remission, or recovery, but there is always the chance it could come back if you indulge anorectic habits. 

But, every country has different guidelines. :)

As for rape, I honestly think that's the truth, you don't ever want to believe a loved one was raped, and my dad is the King of Denial. He's always been spectacular at lying about something until he honestly believes he's been right all along. It's bizarre. And it sucks. 

I never downvoted you, I sincerely appreciate that you were trying to help and I also understand that sometimes these things come out offensive when they're not intended to be. Just be careful with it in the future! :)      Adorable little derpface! :D I love him, he's a beautiful animal!      Adorable little derpface! :D I love him, he's a beautiful animal!

It's so frustrating because I can't get disability benefits or anything and my medications cost upwards of $250 a month WITH insurance. I have had friends tell me I should take legal action with the family stuff, saying its abuse, but I can't live on my own through sheer inability to support myself. Some days I'm too sick to even get up to get water. It's been fucking awful. 

I'm just so lost and in pain with no hope of getting out.      I actually use it on occasion, and it has been the ONLY thing to help my pain and that helps me sleep through the night. But I'm scared to use it because I am afraid to eat.

Edit: Also because it saps my energy and makes my brain even foggier than the fibro does. It makes it much harder to be productive. In small doses it is helpful, but I think it's still pretty hard to use.       Exactly. I'm constantly told by people (like my biological father) that my problems don't exist and I just want to punch him.

Edit: and now baconlover444 is PMing me with abuse. Yay.        Haha it's okay, I don't mind. I'm just touched that you're taking the time to talk to me. I've been getting frustrated looking for resources for sick or disabled adults, but if I'm not legally disabled I can't benefit. If you're able to think of any specific resources that would be great! I don't know where to look, and it seems like Google is being purposefully obtuse and is not looking for what I need.       Haha it's okay, I don't mind.

Seriously thank you though. I know what you're saying is true but it's so fucking terrifying. I don't know how I could possibly deal with harder living at a shelter and an even worse life right now. I feel like I'm two seconds away from snapping. I'm trying so hard to keep it all together.       Haha it's okay, I don't mind. I'm just touched that you're taking the time to talk to me.

I feel like I'm two seconds away from snapping. I'm trying so hard to keep it all together.      I suppose. I won't be able to afford my medication and the pain will get worse.

But I can't ask for help from them because they are sick of me.      I just don't know how many more times I can be abused before I give up. I almost did yesterday. I was sitting outside crying and my dad sat on the deck yelling sarcastic, horrible things at me while I begged him to leave me alone. But I couldn't go inside because I was going to hurt myself.       Actually I was diagnosed and treated. Anorexia nervosa diagnoses used to require a BMI of below 16.5, actually, and now the medical diagnosis guide (I can't remember the initials) altered the diagnosis requirements so, if I remember correctly, the weight standards are even more different. 

Please don't diagnose strangers on the Internet. I trust my multiple doctors, psychiatrists, therapists, nutritionists, and all of the other medic",1

I miss the community too. I miss killer beautiful thinspo. I miss loose clothes. I miss the constant inner battle.

I would've chewed up antacids but I didn't have any, that's usually my go to thing. (The mentos-type of antacids that are chewy)

I brush about an hour or two later.     The first time I did it I felt nothing too. All I felt was very warm and a tad speedy...but the second time I was sick to my stomach and really uppity. It's worked for me ever since, minus the insane nausea. \\\_()_/ 
Maybe try it again?      Omg     Haha that's funny you mention that, I bought some a couple of months back and it was pretty good. I have to have it really cold though.   Health Food Store find, worth trying!  So I bought a Virgil's Zero Cream Soda in a glass bottle when I was wandering around a health food store and it is HEAVEN. 

Glass bottle diet soda ftw. I'm fasting right now and really thirsty and water hasn't been doing much. /: So I got Emergen-C Electro Mix too, I heard someone rave about it a while ago on here. 

There's a lot of stuff in that tiny store. I finally have found a place that sells a good variety of Yogi tea. :D 

Any good buys anyone would like to share?     Yeah I can understand that.   [Rant on mobile] Why am I the only one trying?  Okay I just need to vent and I think you guys can relate:

I try hard to look good. It isn't above all the most important thing in my life but I make an effort to look decent. (ED things aside) 

How do other people /not/ care? I work with the public and I can't wrap my head around how some of these people let themselves leave the house. Holy fuck they're crusty. Sorry but it's true. 

How do people just shovel shit into their face with no regard to nutrition or calories at all? 

I think the main reason I'm back into my ED so hard is because seeing someone I know gain and gain and gain and let themselves go really messes with my head. 
That, and I work with the public. I see so many crusty middle aged/old people and obese people ride motorized scooters. Yuck. 

Yeah I'm vain whatever. At least I'm taking care of me and demonstrating personal discipline. I don't need to binge until I hurt a few times a day, as much as I'd sometimes like to, unlike someone I know. 

Basically: I'm frustrated that someone in my life doesn't keep up with themself when I try so hard. 

Anyone ever feel like this? ._. 
Help me I feel terrible about this. 

And no this isn't something I can approach them about. Talking it out is not a conversation I want to have.   Bronkaid is amazing!  Does anybody else find that bronkaid has no effect when you're really tired? I tried it for the first time a few days ago and I barely felt anything at all. :/ But then again I hadn't been sleeping great over the period of three days I spent tossing and turning and I was dead exhausted. .-. The only thing it did for me that day is make me feel like I was on fire. (Calories burning maybe?)

/However/, I finally got plenty of sleep and tried it again today. DAMN.

20 minutes: I'm wide awake and ready to start my fasting day. I whip up some breakfast tea and crack open a diet soda with a vape. 

60 minutes: I have overwhelming nausea, like I could have projectile vomiting at any minute. I wasn't sure if I'd be able to do much today.

90 minutes later the nausea if gone and I feel amazing. 

Seriously, go bronkaid. 

Rave over lol     Aww that's awesome!       You can get it behind the counter at any pharmacy. You need ID (real ID, 18+) and you'll have to sign something too. 

Basically it's like buying Sudafed. Limited quantities per person per 30 days. It's controlled in the US.      Remember that feeling you had next time you get off track. 
You deserve a body you can be proud of.
You got this!      Sometimes my heart is a little flutter-y but not bad. Other than that I haven't noticed anything. 

Rebound hunger might be a side effect but I can't tell bc I only use it fasting. When I break my fast the next day it's harder to avoid a binge. /:      I got mine at CVS      * Height: 5'1

Does anybody else have any experience with tolerance breaks from caffeine? I'm thinking about taking it out for a month to reset my tolerance. :/ I don't have a crazy resistance to it but I think I'm too reliant on coffee/diet energy drinks/soda/etc. I still plan to drink green tea occasionally during my break though. Green tea is amazing. 

I can do it. It's all in my head. Just like my fast right now.

I don't know why I typed this out, I'm just thinking out loud. 
My EC stack is making me chatty. ._.      That sounds oddly fimiliar. I feel ya.     Wow. That's pretty shitty. I'd die too. /; I can't stand that type of thing either. I already know how stupid I make myself look; I don't need anyone adding to that yknow? 

You should talk to him about it. Your feelings matter!      Do you like black beans? Oysters (they come in a can too) have a lot too, although they can be higher cal when they're packed with oil.      Artic Zero is amazing. I'm glad I'm not the only one here who has heard of it. Vanille Maple pretty good      What a bitch. Wow. What's her bossy ass going to do if you don't eat it exactly? Nothing. 
I agree, she shouldn't push your boundaries like that. 

Maybe she's jealous.      I'm not gonna lie, it is nice and I don't miss the lack of privacy. It isn't cheap though. /: Being an adult is one of the hardest things you'll ever do. 

I'm scared about going to hard off the deep end and getting hospitalized too (like general hospital, not psych, never psych again.) but even if you do ""embrace recovery"" (whatever that is) as an adult YOU get to run the show. Not an aloof bunch of ""professionals"" and your parents. Fuck that noise. 
I hear you loud and clear hon.

Last time I purged I swished my mouth with pepto bismuth (""nausea, heartburn, indigestion, upset stomach, diarrhea"").  I don't know if it works or not.

Maybe try it again?      Omg     Haha that's funny you mention that, I bought some a couple of months back and it was pretty good. I have to have it really cold though.   Health Food Store find, worth trying!  So I bought a Virgil's Zero Cream Soda in a glass bottle when I was wandering around a health food store and it is HEAVEN. 

Glass bottle diet soda ftw. I'm fasting right now and really thirsty and water hasn't been doing much. /: So I got Emergen-C Electro Mix too, I heard someone rave about it a while ago on here. 

There's a lot of stuff in that tiny store. I finally have found a place that sells a good variety of Yogi tea. :D 

Any good buys anyone would like to share?     Yeah I can understand that.   [Rant on mobile] Why am I the only one trying?  Okay I just need to vent and I think you guys can relate:

I try hard to look good. It isn't above all the most important thing in my life but I make an effort to look decent. (ED things aside) 

How do other people /not/ care? I work with the public and I can't wrap my head around how some of these people let themselves leave the house. Holy fuck they're crusty. Sorry but it's true. 

How do people just shovel shit into their face with no regard to nutrition or calories at all? 

I think the main reason I'm back into my ED so hard is because seeing someone I know gain and gain and gain and let themselves go really messes with my head. 
That, and I work with the public. I see so many crusty middle aged/old people and obese people ride motorized scooters. Yuck. 

Yeah I'm vain whatever. At least I'm taking care of me and demonstrating personal discipline. I don't need to binge until I hurt a few times a day, as much as I'd sometimes like to, unlike someone I know. 

Basically: I'm frustrated that someone in my life doesn't keep up with themself when I try so hard. 

Anyone ever feel like this? ._. 
Help me I feel terrible about this. 

And no this isn't something I can approach them about. Talking it out is not a conversation I want to have.   Bronkaid is amazing!  Does anybody else find that bronkaid has no effect when you're really tired? I tried it for the first time a few days ago and I barely felt anything at all. :/ But then again I hadn't been sleeping great over the period of three days I spent tossing and turning and I was dead exhausted. .-. The only thing it did for me that day is make me feel like I was on fire. (Calories burning maybe?)

/However/, I finally got plenty of sleep and tried it again today. DAMN.

20 minutes: I'm wide awake and ready to start my fasting day. I whip up some breakfast tea and crack open a diet soda with a vape. 

60 minutes: I have overwhelming nausea, like I could have projectile vomiting at any minute. I wasn't sure if I'd be able to do much today.

90 minutes later the nausea if gone and I feel amazing. 

Seriously, go bronkaid. 

Rave over lol     Aww that's awesome!       You can get it behind the counter at any pharmacy. You need ID (real ID, 18+) and you'll have to sign something too. 

Basically it's like buying Sudafed. Limited quantities per person per 30 days. It's controlled in the US.      Remember that feeling you had next time you get off track. 
You deserve a body you can be proud of.
You got this!      Sometimes my heart is a little flutter-y but not bad. Other than that I haven't noticed anything. 

Rebound hunger might be a side effect but I can't tell bc I only use it fasting. When I break my fast the next day it's harder to avoid a binge. /:      I got mine at CVS      * Height: 5'1

I'm way late to the party, but I just feel the need to say that I really don't think this is the norm. I played softball for 14 years, and (please don't bang the 'STEREOTYPE' gong) I've spent a LOT of time changing with a LOT of lesbians. For the most part, they went out of their way to make sure the straight girls weren't uncomfortable, to the point where we would tell them to calm their shit and just change their goddamn clothes already.

A contact prescription and a glasses prescription are different, and most states legally require a separate exam for them. They are also considered a medical device because they are inserted in your eye, so there are added fees that go along with them. Most states require a contact lense training session, and then a follow up appointment to check the fit, comfort, and health. This is legally required before they will release the RX, and then you can take the RX to 1-800 Contacts. Typically offices will charge one up front fee that covers all of this, including any troubleshooting and changing of lense brands until you are comfortable, and it will vary depending on whether or not you have an astigmatism high enough to require corrective contacts. Where I work it's $95 up front for spherical or $115 for toric (for astigmatism) for the fitting, not including contacts. The toric lenses are also more expensive. Typically they want that fitting fee paid half at the training session and half at the follow up, but they have allowed the fees to be paid out monthly. Contacts must be paid for at the time of receipt. I hope this gives you some info!   
  
Edit: also know that these fitting fees are a one time fee, every year after that it's just a $45 evaluation fee and then you get your RX. Also ask about rebates! We're doing a $40 rebate right now for certain brands.      Kim is famous because she had a very private tape released to the public without her permission, and instead of letting it ruin her, she took advantage of the situation and used it to give her entire family jobs and careers. But for some reason she's the bad guy, instead of someone who made the very best outcome out of a horrifying situation.      She had a private tape released without her permission. And instead of letting it totally ruin her life and instead of living in shame, she took advantage of the situation and created a wonderful life for her entire, very large family. I can think of worse things for people to do, honestly.      I went back to look. It doesn't appear that the scars were there during the initial walk up to the building, or in a few scenes during the fire fight. Just acquired somewhere in the scuttle, it seems.      I'm really pleased with the little bit of progress I've seen so far. I'm finding it easier to get myself to the gym than it has been in the past. I do have some serious gym frustration right now though, because my gym only has ONE free barbell, in a squat rack, to be used for ANY barbell exercises. That means if I need to bench, squat, deadlift, row, etc., I'm waiting for this ONE squat rack. Usually I haven't had too much trouble or had to wait too long until last week. A guy started showing up about five minutes before I do, and he is... he's just the worst. He is the slowest moving creature that has ever drawn breath, I'm sure of it. He does front squats. ONE REP, and rests for THREE MINUTES. He does this for an HOUR. I really try to be patient and not judge other's routines, but COME ON. I tried to get there earlier, and there he was. I came later, and there he was. I've been trying to switch gyms but my gym owner is completely ducking me.  
  
/rant     I also own the 2 in 1 compression with the loose shorts over the top. I have a pretty big butt and thighs compared to my waist. I found that while I liked them and I thought they fit me in a very flattering way, the loose shorts on top bunched up any time I tried to run. The compression shorts make it less noticeable, but that also means that the top shorts bunch up a TON before I'd even really notice. I still wear them just casually, but I ditched them for gym use.     I do an ab circuit three times a week that DEFINITELY makes me feel the burn. I do these three exercises back to back, and then rest for 1 minute.  
  
Cable Crunches x 15  
Captain's Chair to burnout  
Bicycles to burnout  
  
Repeat circuit 3 or four times and you'll be burning by the end. I like it because it's quick and it doesn't require a lot of extra setup or prep after I've already done my lifts for the day.      My city just got a Chipotle and people won't shut up about it. The main reason I've avoided it is because I'm afraid it's going to be in everything. Guess I'm not going anytime soon...      Yes! I've seen that and I swear that's my problem.       That part of it is definitely what keeps me going. I love lifting, and I have seen a change in my numbers, which is something I honestly didn't expect at all. 
  
As far as food, I have been watching my macros like a hawk and I've read just about everything I can find on the proper kinds of food. I have spoken to many professionals as I received treatment for anorexia, but they typically advise against getting too deep into any type of fitness program because of how obsessive people with eating disorders tend to be. Kind of like a ""gateway drug"" to falling back into old habits. I feel like I've made enough progress to handle it, but it's tough. Thank you for your advice. It really helps to know people care.      Typically it is, but in special cases (such as anorexia) your body does all kinds of things to fight what you are doing. For example, it will even begin to produce a very thin, fine layer of hair called lanugo. More or less what the guy above me said.      I do understand the medication part; was it a lithium based med? Anything lithium based causes unbelievably rapid weight gain.  
  
Thank you for sharing your experience. It is rare to see a male speak about living with anorexia, and I'm sure it's difficult. I want so badly to have a healthy relationship with food. I just want to FEEL healthy. And I have been feeling so much better, it's just those thoughts that creep in telling me that I'm doing something wrong because I'm not hungry. The fear is a major part.   22/f: From an ED to serious lifting, and I need your help!  Hi, Fittit. I've lurked for a while and I guess it's time to suck it up and ask for help. Also, apologies in advance if my formatting sucks as I'm on mobile, and for how long this will surely end up being. 
  
I have struggled with weight issues my entire life. I was always just a little bigger than my friends, and it secretly tore me up. My food issues got pretty serious around the time I turned 17. I started eating less, losing weight, and getting compliments. It felt good, so I kept doing it. I was very athletic all my life; I played softball from ages 4-18, and played on multiple competitive traveling teams almost year round from about 12-18. I played catcher exclusively, so I stayed toned and rather muscular without much extra work. However, my body issues and eating issues really got in the way by the time I was supposed to start college, and lost me a softball scholarship. This is where it turned dangerous.   
  
I started to heavily restrict my diet, and it continued to get worse and worse as time went by. My goal intake was 500 calories a day. I became anemic, I was losing my hair, I was dizzy, couldn't sleep, etc. I know it sounds crazy, but I truly was convinced that I wasn't hurting myself. It made me feel strong to lose weight and buy smaller clothes. It was an obsession, but it was so, so hard to keep up.  At some point I sort of lost motivation and  started slowly gaining weight, though I wasn't happy about it. In this time (right before my 20th birthday) I became pregnant. Eating during pregnancy was a no brainer, even for me. Aside from a few short bouts of restricting days, I had a perfectly healthy pregnancy and a perfectly healthy baby girl. However, as soon as she was born, the disordered eating came back twofold.  
  
Fast forward another year of severe restricting, health issues, struggling, weight loss, weight gain, and being 100% reckless with my health and future. It was worse than it was before, and it was ruining my life and my relationship with my boyfriend. One day, I was staring at my daughter running back and forth. She was asking me to get up and play with her, and it hit me.  
  
""I will not be alive to enjoy her life if I don't fix this.""   
  
I bought ""Thinner, Leaner, Stronger"" by Mike Matthews and decided right then and there that I was going to change my life for the better, and then I binged on any and every food I could get my hands on for a whole month. I finally got to the point where my (rapid) weight gain tapered off and I figured I had more or less reset my metabolism, and I prepared to start some serious weightlifting and macro planning. 
  
I've been at it for about five weeks now and I truly LOVE lifting! My intake is about 1530 calories a day and I pay extremely close attention to macros. But here is my problem. Compared to just not eating, seeing results seems to take FOREVER. I have spent many years programming myself to think that feeling hungry is strong and being full means I fucked up and I should be ashamed. Moderation was never something I practiced; it was either eat every single thing I can find, or eat barely anything at all. Losing weight and seeing a difference in your body doesn't take long when you're starving yourself. My question is, how do I push through the disordered thoughts and stay patient? How long does it normally take to really see a difference in your body? I find it really hard to stay motivated sometimes, and I have bouts where I binge like crazy and get really down because I don't feel like I'm accomplishing anything. How do I keep my focus on the prize?  
  
I don't want to be sickeningly thin anymore. I want to be STRONG. I want it so, so badly. I just need some advice.  
  
TL;DR: went from anorexic to a skinnyfat physique, and now trying to lift seriously. How do I stay motivated and patient in regard to seeing results?      Stand it up in the cup holder on the next hot day! It'll re-melt flat.     It was about 6:30 am, I had just got back from the gym, and I was starving. I wasn't being especially attentive to my banana separating technique.       I've tried both ways, shorter and longer steps. Maybe I should use lighter dumbbells? I just assumed that I would be able to do a higher weight since it was a leg workout as compared to what I use with arms. I've had some experience with weightlifting, but I've never done lunges with any type of weight before this, they were just always incorporated with a warm up of some kind.  
  
I haven't tried split squats. I was hoping that if I did have to replace it, that I would find an exercise that still involved using some weight.      So I'm not crazy! I never thought about step-ups, thanks! Would I start with the same amount of weight I'm doing the lunges with?   Does anyone Else HATE barbell lunges? Or am I just doing them wrong?  Currently for my leg days, I do 3x8-10 on barbell squats, leg press, dumbbell lunges, and RDL. With the squats, leg press, and RDL, I push myself with weight each week and by the 8-10 rep, I'm struggling with the weight. This is where I want to be, and those lifts are all pain free besides the typical difficulty with the last few reps. Currently I'm squatting 80 lbs 3x10, leg pressing 90 lbs 3x10, and RDL 85 lbs 3x10. For the dumbbell lunges I use 15 lb dumbbells in each hand.  
  
Here's the thing. I HATE them. I feel immediate pain in my knees and hips when doing them., and it doesn't feel like my legs really get tired. I just stop at eight reps on each leg because I feel like I'm going to hurt something. I feel like I'm doing them completely wrong, and I've read up on form and watched videos about a hundred times. Am I using way too much weight? Or do I just need to stop them before I hurt myself? If so, what are some good lifts that will replace them?  
  
Any advice would be SO greatly appreciated. I feel like I'm not getting the most out of my leg days because of this.

Edit: In my title, I put barbell lunges, but I meant dumbbell. Way to go, me.  
  
Edit 2: I guess I should also mention that I am a 22 year old female.      I haven't spoken to a counselor about this subject because they are extremely hesitant about promoting any type of serious exercise program for people who are recovering. If I express any type of negative feelings towards it, it tends to cause counselors to tell you it's a bad idea. I really think I'm ready for this, though. I've come a long way from 99 pounds and I think I'm healthy enough for this.  
  
Thank you so much for your kind words, I really do appreciate it.

I actually am working on cutting at the moment. I promise it's a rational and healthy goal! In that month of insane binging before I started lifting, I gained a lot of weight. I'm currently sitting at about 152 lbs and I'm 5'5. I don't want to cut a ton of weight, but 10 or 15 pounds is really want I want to lose.

Looking back on how strong I used to be playing softball, it is SO disheartening how much I've weakened and atrophied my muscles over the last few years. I can't do a single push up, or even think about doing a pull up.      I do see what you're saying, and usually starvation mode is bogus. However I do know that it is possible to damage one's metabolism and need to repair it. There's sort of a gray area in certain situations.  
  
I'm not sure what you mean by bending the truth...      I'm afraid it's not quite as simple as just ""removing emotion"". If it were, I don't suppose I would have been diagnosed with an eating disorder...It's much more deeply engrained. I'm sure it probably is simple for a lot of people.  
  
I'm honestly not sure how to take this.    Could you lovely ladies take a look at my routine?  Hey guys! I've done a TON of research and I've put together a lifting/meal plan for myself, and I would love any input or advice y'all might have. I'm 23 years old and currently 155 lbs at 5'5. I would love to lose about 20 pounds, which is what I've packed on in the last six months or so. Yuck. I've struggled in the past with anorexia and one day I just snapped and decided I couldn't do that anymore, or I'd end up dead. Obviously it wasn't quite that easy, but I've come a long way in the last six months. I'm over wanting to be stick thin; I want to be strong!  
  
I read Mike Matthew's [Thinner, Leaner, Stronger](http://www.amazon.com/Thinner-Leaner-Stronger-Building-Ultimate-ebook/dp/B0098PYV7Q/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1407187793 sr=8-1 keywords=thinner+leaner+stronger) and I really loved his views and how much research he's done. He has a pretty strong hatred for the way the media and fitness world thinks women should be working out (low weight/high reps), and stresses heavy lifting.  
  
My workout schedule goes as follows:  
All exercises are performed 3x8-10 unless stated otherwise  
  
**Monday: Legs**

As far as meal planning, I'm eating around 1550 calories a day, and my goals are 32g fat, 140g carbs, and 180g protein.  
  
**Supplements**  
I'm doing fasted training and I train first thing in the morning, about 6:00 am. Before my workout I take about 7g yohimbe, 10g BCAAs, and 2 VPX Meltdown fat burners. After training I have 2 scoops whey protein, green tea extract, fish oil pills, and a multivitamin. At lunch I'll have more green tea extract, multivitamin, and fish oil pills. I have another scoop of whey protein after work and I take the last of the fish oil at night.  
  
I've done so much research that my brain hurts, and I think at this point I'm over-thinking it. Any feedback y'all have would be so greatly appreciated!     The past? It's not like she's talking about something that happened ten years ago. It was three days ago, Jesus. She clearly hasn't even fully grasped the event. She's obviously struggling with what her emotions are. All I'm trying to say is insensitivity in this situation doesn't help anyone, and that's what the original comment was: insensitive. ""you should have"" creates guilt, and that a dangerous feeling to press upon someone so soon after such a horrible experience.      Reminding someone and telling someone what they should have done and all the people that will now suffer because of their decision are two different things. There's a reason that rape goes so highly unreported, and while going to the police would be the ideal decision, you have no idea how hard that decision is until you have been in that situation yourself. All I'm saying is that comment had absolutely no point other than to bring guilt to OP.      Sure, because guilt tripping someone who just went through a god FUCKING awful situation is obviously the right thing to do.      I'm fairly flexible; I haven't had any flexibility issues with anything else I've been doing.      It always seems like my hips are going to give out. They even pop sometimes, and not in a ""oh, just getting warmed up for a rep"" way. More in a ""holy fuck, what the hell was that"" way.      Feel free! I really like the lifting routine; I never feel overwhelmed by it or anything. I just really hate cardio, so that's my main struggle with it.   [QUESTION] Cheat meals: do they completely destroy your motivation, or is it just me?  I am currently working with macros and I plan out my meals for the week to make sure I meet them. I am allowed one cheat meal a week, which I know is pretty common. Here's my problem: once I have that cheat meal, I feel this overwhelming sense of failure and my brain just sort of gives up. I never fails, for the next couple of days I will actually under eat, not on purpose, but just because I lose the motivation to figure out what I need to be eating and where my macros are. I find it nearly impossible to get myself to the gym. It always takes me at least a couple of days to get back on track after the cheat meal, and I feel like it ruins all the hard work and progress I've made during the entire week. Am I alone in this? If you guys are dealing with similar things, how do you combat it?     I used to exercise A LOT - I played competitive softball for both my school and for a traveling tournament team. I was the catcher so I was definitely in good shape, plus high school athletics included a lot of weightlifting and running. I played volleyball as well. However I've been pretty much entirely sedentary since 2009 besides chasing around a 2 year old. The time I spent struggling with ED weakened me considerably, so I've set myself back pretty far. I just really had the urge to dive headfirst into this. I hope I don't burn out :/  
  
This plan is part of the book I read, and he just proposes one leg day. These workout are typically taking about 45 minutes to 1 hour, and that's really all the time I have to spend at the gym. I work full time and have a 2 year old, so I'm pretty busy. Would having two leg days lengthen the workouts, or is there another way to situate it?  
  
I totally agree about the diet part - this is the aspect that's the hardest for me and the most confusing. I've really been having trouble getting 180 g of protein! I actually have felt like I'm eating a TON of food, but that could be because of my past habits. More than anything I'm just suck of chicken breasts, haha. I'll definitely look into tweaking my numbers because you're not the first person to say this.  
  
What I've been doing if I miss a workout is to shift all workouts by a day and using my Sunday (cardio only) as a lifting day to get myself back on track.      Diet is definitely the part of this that's giving me the most issues. I've never really focused on anything about food besides calorie count, so I've been trying to learn as much as I can. Multiple of people have suggested that I should lower protein, and I'm honestly glad because I was finding it nearly impossible to reach 180g. I am trying to cut, but I guess I should up my fat some too. I'm honestly finding it really hard to cram in 1550 calories, so upping that number seems daunting. I suppose that could be old demons more than anything, though. Thank you for your suggestions! It helps A TON. :)      You're SO RIGHT. I tried to do cardio this morning after yesterday's legs and I damn near died. Someone else said that 4x a week cardio was too much, so I'm thinking of maybe just dropping Tuesday's cardio completely. Does that seem like a good idea to you?  
  
I like the idea of focusing more on my legs. They're definitely the part of my body that I'd most like to see improve - the women in my family seem to be cursed with extensive cellulite if you let your legs go AT ALL. I was a catcher in softball for 14 years so I took for granted having ridiculously toned legs and booty :( I'll look into this for sure!     Wow! Thank you so much for all of your input!  
  
I'm glad you suggested subbing the barbell lunges with the barbell hip thrusts. The lunges are the only exercise that I completely, 100% HATE with a burning passion. I've been looking for something I can sub but wasn't sure how to choose something else.  
  
As for the HIIT cardio, I've only been able to last 15 minutes so 25 was just sort of a goal, but I can see how it might be too much.   
  
The plan I'm following has a week 1-8 routine and then changes it up for weeks 9-16. I believe it subs in wide grip lat pulldown for the close grip, but I'm not 100% sure and I don't have it with me at the moment. Does that sound like a good idea to you?  
  
The reason I have Friday as my complete off day is because it's the one day that I absolutely have ZERO time for working out unless I want to wake up at 4am, which I'll never do on a Friday. I wish I could move it though :/  
  
Pretty much everyone who has commented on this has told me it's too much protein, and I'm SO GLAD. I was finding it nearly impossible to cram it all in!  
  
I'm not new to fitness, just starting over completely pretty much. I've been entirely inactive since 2009 plus a pregnancy in 2011. I didn't gain a whole lot of weight and I worked on my feet 40 hours up until the very last week of pregnancy, but I could definitely tell it set me back a bit. I do feel a bit overwhelmed by all the changes at once, but I'm excited about it.  
  
Thank you so much for all your input! You've helped tremendously.   [QUESTION] Supplements on a budget: What are you bottom line must-haves?  Hello ladies!  
  
As a mother of a two year old with a boyfriend and a mortgage, we are currently attempting to overhaul our budget and start saving a lot more than we do right now. My boyfriend doesn't exercise or go to the gym whatsoever and has no plans to, which is fine. I however do, and being rather new to supplements, I just sort of bought a little of everything that I see people using. I currently use protein powder, a BCAA powder (I do fasted training in the AM), fish oil, creatine, green tea extract, a fat burner, and a daily multivitamin. I feel like I need to cut back, but I have no idea which supplements I should do without.  
  
What do you guys use, and what have you gotten rid of? I know some supplementing is important but I just can't continue to spend what I do on everything.  My boyfriend (26M) and I (23F) have a toddler, a mortgage, and student loans for days. Not entirely sure on how to proceed.  For starters, here's our current budget:
**Monthly income: $3420 (lowballed; he works on commission)**  
  
**Monthly Expenses**  
Daycare: $516  
Groceries: $500  
Household Extras: $100  
Electricity: $160  
Mortgage: $490  
Water/Trash: $70  
Credit Card 1 (mine): $25  
Credit Card 2 (mine): $30  
Credit Card 3 (his): $55  
Credit Card 4 (his): $45  
Student Loan Payments: $178  
Truck Payment: $100  
Cable/Internet: $190  
Cell Phone: $70  
Gas: $150  
Netflix/Hulu: $18  
Gym: $33  
Car Insurance: $75  
Clothing: $50  
Entertainment: $75  
Lawn: $25-50  

**Total Monthly Expenses: $3010**  
**Monthly Leftover Cash: $410-ish**  
    
This looks to put us at about $410 leftover at the end of each month. I have no idea how good or bad this is.  
  
As of right now, we do not have an emergency fund of any kind. I guess I didn't realize how important this was until I started following this subreddit. We've been very fortunate to not have any real emergencies, so I guess I've just sort of looked the other way. If I understand right, our emergency fund should have at minimum $8652, and by reading the FAQ I saw that the first thing we should focus on is building that up. However, I guess my question is this: If our budget is exactly precise which I know it won't be, we would have to focus on building only that for the next 21 months. Am I right that we shouldn't focus on paying down debts until we have built this fund? Or is there some way we should be doing both?  
  
He has about $1300 of credit card debt and I have about $1200. My interest rates on my two cards are at about 18.5%, and I'm not currently sure about his. I was always under the impression that paying the minimum only each month lowers your credit score. Is that incorrect? I know carrying a high percentage of balance on the card does. I've been doing so much reading here lately that I'm really overwhelmed.  
  
As far as 401k, he is already contributing the highest amount that his company matches, so we're good there. My job doesn't offer a 401k, but I have one left over from my last job. What should I do with that?  
  
I'm really motivated to turn our financial situation around; I'm tired of constantly living paycheck to paycheck with zero future plans financially. I really don't know how bad of shape we're in because all of our friends are still in school and without children or mortgages or responsibilities whatsoever, so there's little for me to compare to. Any input you guys might have would be greatly appreciated!     Front tooth gap in females. I am a female. Hnnngghh.      I wish I could vary my meals more, but I just simply don't have time to cook myself something different every night on top of cooking for my two year old and boyfriend.  
  
Thinking about it the opposite way is a great idea! That totally makes sense. I'm recovering from an ED and I went from being about 15 pounds underweight to about 20 pounds overweight, so I have hit every spot on the spectrum as far as crazy binges and restriction. Moderation is the main thing I'm trying to get the hang of right now, and it's proving difficult. Thank you for the helpful advice!     I'm definitely seeing an increase in my strength; all my lifts have gone up and that's really exciting! I am recovered from anorexia so I definitely struggle with seeing changes in my body, but I have noticed some definition in my arms that I like. I try not to weigh myself too much.  
  
I guess my main issue is that I'm impatient: when you just don't eat, you tend to lose weight quickly and that's what I'm used to. (NOT AT ALL promoting it as a solution -- anorexia is a sure way to destroy your mind and your body). While I'm LOVING finally feeling healthy and strong instead of shaky and close to death, waiting to see any real results is torture. I love lifting, hate cardio. But that seems to be the norm for most people, haha. The macro planning is a little stressful for me -- moderation has never really been my strong suit. However I ultimately enjoy the foods I'm eating. I get a little tired of the repetition of eating the same foods, but with a two year old and a full time job I don't really have time to plan out different meals for myself every day on top of cooking for the fam.  
  
I wish I would have taken measurements, but I've been told that with the ED recovery, it's better not to.     I look forward to mine all week too! And I always feel super motivated until AFTER. That's when I feel like I screwed everything up.    Jump rope for HIIT?  Happy Sunday!  
  
I've been lifting for a while as well as doing HIIT cardio three to four times a week on either the elliptical or the treadmill. I thought I'd see if any of you guys have used jump rope as a successful HIIT alternative. I despise running, and the elliptical is just boring to me. Thoughts/suggestions/successful routines?      I have struggled with anorexia since I was 15 years old, and though I am technically recovered, it is still a constant struggle.  
  
I have a two year old daughter, and though this may not be typical, I was more at peace with my body during pregnancy than I have ever been, before or after. When struggling with an ED, it's so easy to be angry at your body for not doing the things you want it to do. Pregnancy made me proud of my body. Not of what it looked like, but what it was doing for me and for my daughter. I felt strong. Of course, I had bad days, but for the most part I was just overwhelmed with respect for my body. It also was so much easier for me to eat what I needed. Not easy, but easier. Because it wasn't for me. It was for her. What I did struggle with was post-pregnancy.      I know a lot of people are saying, ""just do it"", but it's true. I fell out of lifting for a short time and [this](http://www.muscleforlife.com/shut-up-and-train/) article SERIOUSLY kicked me back into high gear. If you ever want to get into lifting and training, I'd highly recommend his book ""Thinner, Leaner, Stronger"" as well. He does a great job at motivating, and he does a TON of research.     A stomach virus hit me at about ten last night, and I've spent most of my time since then on my bathroom floor. I have managed recently to migrate to my bed, and Netflix is keeping me occupied. I just want some egg drop soup, man.      Mike Matthews also does this. He reads an insane amount of papers and studies.

www.muscleforlife.com      I guess my situation is more that my body learned to maintain on an extremely low calorie diet for a long time. Whereas some women can eat 1500-plus calories a day and lose or maintain weight, I was basically gaining on 1300 calories. What I want to do is jump back into eating around 1650 calories a day and lift, so I can gain muscle and strength, and I'm trying to find out if my body will catch up to that, or if it will just cause me to endlessly gain.  
  
I'm at the point now where I've gained more than I needed to, because I really dove back into recovery and eating and enjoying food. I would like to lose a few pounds, but I have to make sure I can do it with a healthy amount of nutrition and calories.  
  
It's a hard thing to explain, and I'm rambling I think. Haha. Thank you for your advice! I'm glad you're past your sick years. :) Also, thank you for your offer to talk. I may PM you when I figure out solid questions.      I guess I'm really more looking for anecdotal stories than anything - people who have been in similar situations and what their experience",1
subject3132,"    Nicky because she is just downright a good person who I think I'd get along with. Great character.     Named my first electric, an Ibanez, Alex as is seemed suiting to the sound.
My Fender acoustic is named Tom because why not.
My new Black and Gold Epiphone Custom Pro LP is named Jesus.     Thanks for finally putting what, in my opinion, a lot of people wanted to say but didn't exactly know how, I included. 

I guess we'll never know if we see him again, after all- he did get a clone phone.      I haven't seen S1 in so long but all I can remember is her saying that one day she's gonna get Delphine ""so baked"".. If only we knew everything would end up happily ever after and this had any chance at all of being fulfilled.     C, Am, G, D 

or

The pre-chorus to Up All Night by Blink-182.
It just happens, it is great.     Could be a new clone. It looked slightly like S (possibly because of the clothes). It probably isn't though.      I'm pretty sure Felix was actually just sleeping there and heard Sarah break in, so he went to investigate.

I just re-watched the scene and Fee did seem to have a 'Fee-Style' investigation look going on with his beanie, coat and flashlight. After all, he does have his own apartment to stay in. 

Thanks for the comments though, greatly appreciated.
  Thoughts regarding Felix. (spoilers?)  So, I have never exactly ""trusted"" Felix and some events recently have lead to that feeling growing even bigger. A few reasons why are as follows (I am not sure whether anyone else has already mentioned these):

* He left Cal's cabin just before Daniel Rosen arrived. Did he tell DYAD or Daniel where Sarah and Kira were located?
* In episode 2x04, Fee was for some reason also snooping around Mrs. S' house when Sarah was.
* Why does he want Alison to stay in rehab? Does he want to cut her off from the other clones?

To elaborate on the second point. As I was thinking about the baby-tooth stem cell match scene with Delphine and Scott in 2x06, I thought about how DYAD could have possibly gotten a hold of (Kira's?) tooth. Maybe Fee was snooping in S' house to find an old tooth? There is always a possibility for anything in this brilliant show.

I am not sure if my suspicions are valid or not. Maybe the writers and producers wanted the element of suspicion surrounding Fee so us viewers are not so sure of what we suspect we will see in the coming episodes. 

Any thoughts or additions?

     I thoroughly enjoyed this one. It is written superbly! [""Of Microscopes and Bloody Hopes""](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9958328/1/Of-Microscopes-and-Bloody-Hopes)     He is not British though he has never said that he isn't gay. If I recall correctly, there was an interview where he didn't want to reveal that aspect of him as it would ""change the whole dynamic of Felix as a character"".  Foo Fighters - Everlong (Cover by Legs)       ""Welcome to the trip, man.""     It was meiosis, not mitosis. Sorry to pick that out.     That could be a possibility. No one knows who the original is, or if there even is an original. I just assumed Rachel was more closely related to the scientists [Spoiler](#s ""considering her last name being the same as them. She could possibly be the first clone, a sort of test to see if the procedure would work. They might have decided to keep Rachel."")     Yep, I agree. At least we get to meet Carlton in the next episode.     Nice theories. I have a whole bunch written down and will try to add later, but for now I just wanted to clarify something you said. In the first 'Project LEDA' part, you mentioned something at the end regarding Mrs.S wanting to protect Kira to such an extent because she is Sarah's offspring and exhibits all the characteristics they wanted from the beginning. 
This makes it seem as though you think Mrs.S is one of the scientists in the LEDA photo. I am not 100% sure of myself here but I don't think Mrs.S was one of them as she was too young (possibly, judging from Maria's age). 
The other day I was watching the trailer for 2x04 and noticed the newspaper clipping shot. I paused it and zoomed it (as many others have) and tried to read the caption of the photo with the same two scientists. [Spoiler of what the caption was](#s ""Two scientists were incinerated in laboratory explosion, Project ?LEDA? spearheaded by Professors Susan and Ethan Duncan"")
After reading that a whole flood of theories came to mind. Especially regarding Mrs.S' involvement. In 2x02 her and Brenda were talking of Mrs.S being part of 'Guns for Funs' -  most likely to do with The Troubles in Ireland back in the 1960's. This leads me to thinking she somehow could have been involved in [Spoiler](#s ""what happened with the explosion at the lab"")
It isn't the most clear theory but oh well.     Regarding the brief discussion of Mrs.S' past in 2x02 (dinner at BirdWatcher's), she mentioned that something about being part of ""Guns for Funs"". This immediately stuck me with the hint that she may have been involved in the ""The Troubles"" in Ireland back in the late 1960's. After this, she somehow must have migrated to England. [Spoiler](#s ""If you refer to the most recent preview, a newspaper clipping can be seen which states something regarding two scientists, Ethan and Susan Duncan, being incinerated in a lab explosion""). This in association with Mrs.S' past hints to her possibly being in the act of [Spoiler](#s ""the lab incident. Maybe she was hired with others to collect all research in the lab before it was blown up, or maybe she was hired to blow it up herself/with others. I don't think the explosion was entirely accidental"").
With all this in mind, I still have no idea as to how Mrs.S became involved with Carlton. This thought was not received well on tumblr, but anything can happen on this show right?     Nail gun? I assume if you could get one powerful enough, it could move through most of the skull/brain then slightly pierce its potential exit point.     None of the clones had nay idea they were being monitored until Sarah found the electrode that one morning and Felix, after being filled in, suggested that if he were part of an illegal cloning case with subjects that needed to be monitored, would he place someone on the inside.     We know that Donnie is in the dark regarding the other clones as when he was told to look out for a woman named Sarah, he had no idea of what physical characteristics he was looking for. 
It does make sense for Donnie to keep an eye on Alison because she slept with chad, though the mysterious funeral texts and quirkiness during the phone call in which Alison purposely mentioned Sarah. 
Donnie is trying to do his 'job', though not necessarily that well.     Thanks for this. Definitely something to think about. Now I guess we will just have to wait, look more more clues and then see. Thanks everyone.     Thanks for the input.     Oh shoot. I have just been thinking about what I said and thought ""No one ever confirmed that the other clones were not orphans."" Sorry for just assuming that.  An Original?  I am thinking about Orphan Black a heap these days in preparation of the arrival of the new season. There is one question I just can't seem to have a possible ""answer"" to...: Is there an original clone?
In one of the earlier episodes, when Felix was going through the Birth Certificates Sarah found in Beth's Safe Deposit Box, he mentioned that all the women's births were within a month from one another. So we know that if the clones' DNA would be derivatives of a baby who has been selected to be cloned (meaning they would be older?). Anyone think that maybe one of the clones who were killed in Europe (or a clone/s we don't know about) could be the original. IS THERE EVEN AN ORIGINAL? 

Thanks 
     Personally, I think that several women around the world were selected to become sort of surrogates/mothers for the same group of scientists that asked Amelia to carry a baby. Amelia had twins from the clone egg as it must have split. I also think that if Amelia would not have run away from the scientists, she would have raised the babies as planned and they would have grown up in a family, similarly to the other clones.

A few of my friends and I are school captains and are required to do a presentation at our graduation in a couple of weeks. It was up to us as to what we presented. We have decided to do a funny little ""Guide to surviving Grade 12/IB"".

We have come up with a couple of jokes such as these:
* ""Due tomorrow, do tomorrow!""
* ""You can always re-sit an exam, but you can't re-sit a party!""


Any jokes of similar nature, or memes, would be a great help! We are aiming to be a bit controversial given that we are on our way out of this damn school ;) Thanks all!     I am the only student at my school that could face up to the known wrath of HL History. It was not easy, though, it could have been much harder. I am glad I picked it over HL bio (as I initially was faced with the same dilemma as you). 

You have to enjoy whatever subject you choose - espcecially your HLs. It makes them so much easier to learn and study will not be hated (as much). I love History and find writing essays to be something I have a good grasp of. 

For History, definitely know how to manage your time and thoughts in an exam. For paper 2 and 3, you will have to be strict with your time No more than 5 mins planning per essay, 45 min writing per essay. Studying is also a priority. There is a fuck ton of content in History, no matter what options your teacher picks. Good luck!     In section 1 you want to basically outline your investigation. 
So, 1) WHAT the aim of the investigation is, 2) HOW you intend to approach the analysis of sources in your investigation, 3) a short statement of WHY you are investigating the chosen topic, 4) and a short statement or two on the nature of your sources and your method. 


This section should be sub-200 words. It is meant to be simple and straightforward. Say it as it is, don't exhibit verbosity.       Check out any history magazines that you can access. The HistoryToday online archives have some pretty interesting articles on an array of History topics.

 I struggled for weeks to find a topic that would stick but I kept reading articles pertaining (slightly) to route 2 of History HL. I finally got a topic and it was a breeze. Make sure you pick something that interests you, or you're in for a long ride. 

Good luck, I am sure you'll find something :)     Oh no, that is horrible... Best wishes for your other papers and questions :)     Which question? I did the anxiety/arousal one.     I went in to this paper the most scared I had ever been during these exams. Funnily enough, I came out feeling the best I have so far.     I would agree normally, though in this case, we were not asked to round it up. The question asked ""**During** what year"", which, of course, would be 2019 as it occurred in the 4th quarter.     I got 19.     TZ2 - Much better than paper 1. Hopefully I redeemed myself.     In terms of Stalin, we are not able to use him when answering a question regarding the 'establishment of a single-party state', right?      Magnification and its various types (near point, infinity).      I am also doing Imaging. I am a little stuck...     That's not even in Dubai...
Looks like your friend opted for the buffet and was extremely picky.      I wonder which Italian restaurant? I'd love to go check it out and verify the complete bullshit of this photo. I have lived in Dubai for 10 years and this would only appear in a buffet at most.     The Iron Whey protein tastes great and mixes to a nice, thick shake. I like the banana flavour. I am nearly out. Anyone tried the other flavours and can recommend one?     You're not alone, comrade! I am the only History student in my school so I will spend 3 papers worth of time in the examination room with a exam monitor. At least there is no one to annoying you with tapping feet, clicking pens and flicking papers. Have fun and good luck!     I have been focusing on themes and symbolism (given that they both run strong in my other text- The Whale Rider). Would you be able to share some notes on the stage directions? That is what I have looked at the least. It would be a great help.      I did A Doll's House too!      Yo, a fellow ADH student!      As in question 4 part d) i ?

Great to just chill out and listen to. I love the direction he has taken. Someone recently described him as the Willy Wonka of modern rock music. I couldn't create a sedition more perfectly suited to him.      At what age did each of you begin to play instruments and which do you prefer to play in your downtime?      In many scenes, throughout both seasons,there has been several occurrences of foregrounding of future events. When writing/filming the show, how far in advance do you think ahead of the story/plot?     Nice gear dude! I got the same guitar a few months back. Beautiful guitar right?!      Yea :) 
Duolingo is pretty cool. Good luck in your studies!     It is properly spelled 'ab intitio' which, in Latin, means 'from the beginning'.      It is early days but I feel comfortable and realise that it is not going to be 'easy' and I am prepared for the challenge.      Psychology was just introduced this year as a teacher-taught subject. It used to be online. So far, it is pretty good. A lot of memorization of studies, theories and terms. Exam technique is also pretty important. The teacher is horrible though :/ 

Yeah! History is great! We have not delved into any options yet, though I am sure my teacher has one ready. We have 2 exams till our first term is complete so the roller coaster of IB has only just begun!     I moved from Australia (grade 1 at the time) to Dubai (placed in grade 2). I then magically moved up to grade 3. This is one of the wild occurrences of the Australian Education system. Most of my classmates are 16/17 and we are in IB1.     IB ahaha! My HL's are: English Lang Lit, History, Psychology. SL's are: Physics, Math and French Abinitio.     We are doing this one first. I guess we'll eventually get there :)  [Picture] How to pass IB History (we hope).       I'll keep an eye out, thanks!     Ah ok, thanks!  Unusually quick shipping...  Hello all!
I came home tonight and rushed onto my computer to check my email. Much to my pleasure, I had been matched! I had also received to other email. One at 8:32pm (Dubai time) which stated that my SS had picked up my info and then one at 8:33pm which stated it has been shipped. I have never had this in an exchange before. Common or not?      Thanks for the links! I will check it out :)  Throwing Athletic Events Training anywhere in UAE?  I am in need of a athletics/throwing events trainer or facility to train. I can't seem to find anywhere here where I can get that service. Anyone know anywhere or anyone who can help out? Thanks     Have the same wonderful guitar! It is solid and does the job very well.  [WP] The next best thing.  I wanted to leave this prompt considerably open as I would like to see what people can do with it. I was reading a newspaper article lately that asked this question to its readers and it kind of sparked to me that it would be an ideal prompt for this sub. 

I am excited to see some interpretations of any genre and style on here! Get creative and have fun! :)     I reckon you (anyone) would love Dolores Claiborne. There isn't that real sense of 'horror' to it but the story is told perfectly and encourages you to constantly turn its pages.     There is only hope!...and lack of $$.     A Martin or Taylor acoustic. Been drooling over them for months!     I won a CD on the radio. 

It was Britney Spears.

Woo.  Upcoming album...  Hello all, 

I have been out of the internet scene for a while and have been wondering what is happening with AVA. I remember seeing a post way back when stating that the new album would be called Halloween and would be released then as well. Now, David and Matt are gone and the album is called ""The Dream Walker"". Would anybody be able to kindly inform me of what is happening? Thanks.  While packing the box I couldn't keep her away from me! All the way to Serbia from a German dog in Dubai!       Dubai to US here! Should be awesome. 

Also for the pets exchange it is Dubai to Serbia! Can't wait!     Within the next week i'd say. We are just trying to get a cool poster for as cheap a cost as we can :/  [Request] [$$ Commission] Amateur (awesome) Dubai punk band in need of logo/poster.  Hello artists of /r/drawforme, 

I am one third of Dubai-based punk band, Legs. For the drummer's birthday, I would like to have a poster/logo drawn up for the band. 

There is nothing specific that I want in it, though a cartoon-esque approach would be great. We have attempted to contact local artists and given them examples of past blink-182 posters.

 Such as:
http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qI17CNKr4GY/T5D979xLs_I/AAAAAAAAZ50/g-f3sIBL-G0/s1600/frank+kozik+blink+182+poster.jpg

http://411posters.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/kozik-blink-182-Luxembourg-2012.png

We don't require the posters to be as immensely detailed as those. 

Artists, feel free to take your own approach to this request. Post your sketches and/or ideas for this and I will PM whoever's ideas I find suit the band best. Also willing to discuss a payment. 

EDIT: The bands name is Legs and is typically written as LEGS      Watching the names Steven Spielberg, Brian K. Vaughn, and Stephen King come up in the credits each week reconfirms that Under the Dome is the underachieving child of prime time television. Its the kid whose parents are Oscar winners and Olympic athletes, who gave it every advantage, and yet its out in the student parking lot, huffing patio sealant, killing brain cells, and repeating ninth grade for the third time.

Too true...      I have previously bought some from the Co-op at Etihad Mall. They should have it, though on occasion it seems to have disappeared.  Where to purchase camel meat...?  Hello all. I am on the hunt for some camel meat for an upcoming BBQ. I can't seem to find it at any of the stores I have visited recently (Carrefour MCC, HyperPanda, LuLu Arabian Centre, Aswaaq). Anybody got an idea of where I can find some? Cheers     It is Ramadan at the moment so you are in luck to have a night of varied experiences depending on what you choose to do and where. 

Food wise, an extensive array of buffets for Suhoor are available at most hotels and Iftar tents around the UAE. Many street vendors selling (THE BEST) shawarma are also open late. 

You could take the metro to the Walk at JBR for a late night walk though it is quite humid at night these days. Cinemas are open late too I think. 

I fly out on Thursday! Safe travels :)     Any update?     Just saw your timings that you'll be here. You could still head down to the waterfront near the Burj Khalifa for a nice walk.      You could head down to Dubai Mall and view the world's largest indoor aquarium, the largest fountain in the world and the tallest building in the world! 
It gets quite packed in the mall on the weekends though. Have fun!     I will make sure to organise a more official one later on, though I am heading out tonight to watch a movie and chill afterwards. If you're interested in chilling out, PM me and we'll see what we can organise. :)     Okay, so I guess I will try organise one. It all depends on how many would be able/willing to come. What do you want to do?

  Teenagers in Dubai meetup?  Any chance we could hold one of these? Being a teenager, I do enjoy the idea of attending a McGettigan's brunch though I don't think it is the best thing teenagers can do in this wonderful city!

Cinema, bowling, etc..!  [Thanks] Thank you /u/Killerpet for the Puffin postcard!  Thanks very much! Arrived about 5 days ago :)  For Nepal! Donate and you'll get a postcard from Dubai or Nepal!    [Offer] Postcard Project w/ Nepal and Dubai [WORLDWIDE]  [removed]     No problem :) Sure thing! PM me your address and I will send one off to you as soon as I can.  [Thank you] Thanks to Marisska, Mokomann and PenguinsOnTV!  Thanks for the exchange! The cards are lovely!

     I've lived in Dubai for years and didn't know this place existed... I guess I will have to visit!     Horse Soda would go great with a Bear Taco.     Sure! PM me your address :)     Yup, PM me your details :)     Okay, that's great! Any way we could send any to you?  [Exchange] Beautiful Dubai postcards!  I have lived in Dubai for years and never really explored the 'touristy' side of the city till the other day. I came across some lovely postcards of the skyline and a birds-eye view of the Dubai fountain. I also have one that resembles some camels taking selfies. 

I would love to exchange these cards to people who can send a nice card of their own over. 

PM me to swap addresses


To exchange:

- ~~Dubai night skyline (black and white)~~

- ~~Daytime Dubai fountain~~

- ~~Camels~~


:)

**EDIT: All current cards are taken. I will send them off ASAP. Getting more in the next few days though, so if you are still interested, there will be one for you soon**
     I only recently started a card collection, this would be great! Is living in Dubai a problem?  [WANT] Stephen King books!  Hello! I am an avid Stephen King reader and would like to try out this sub. I own many of his books and am looking forward to reading more. Have any? I am willing to pay in Paypal $$ or might have a book that you want. Thanks :)     I also read The Stand by Stephen King. It took me a fair while to finish it. Out of curiosity, how long (if you can remember) did it take you to read it?      Nice! Looks like a great read :) I got The Green Mile! Can't wait:D  M-O-O-N, that spells ""Merry Christmas""!  Got up early this morning to relax and finish the last 30 pages in The Stand. Hope you all are having a lovely Christmas! Maybe you will find a SK book under the tree for you..Merry Christmas!   Can't decide on program to start as a beginner  Hello all. I am Female, 16, 45kg, 168cm and looking to put on some muscle. 

I am interested in the future to compete in powerlifting though realise I need to put on some mass and strength before then. 
About a year ago I weighed 65kg and was doing lifting at a local gym with a bodybuilding coach but school got in the way. So, I guess I have some (very slight) experience. 

I need a program to follow. I am only able to work around a 3 day per week schedule. Is there any program you recommend to follow?

I do know that eating is a large part of this process and getting my nutrition underway is currently being monitored by a dietitian who is adapting a meal plan for when I start the program. 

I want to look good naked too. Thanks all.

(I have referred to many FAQs and forums but still can't decide)  Training program while gaining weight (F,16)  [removed]     Depends how you cook them. If you sautee them for a few seconds with some salt/pepper/other seasoning, they are alright and are not 'soggy'. If you really cook them down, that's a whole other story. When I do this, I keep them with rice or quinoa, so they kind of soak up the moisture of the veggies.     I sometimes roast sweet potatoes like this but never tried mashing them after. Will try next time! Thanks :)
     I store 2-3 days in the fridge and the rest in the freezer. I don't think there would be anything wrong with chicken after 6 days, though I freeze because of the rice or quinoa possibly drying out.      There are a lot of recipes online! Otherwise, just give it a go with some of your tried and tested 'hits' :) Good luck     So far, so good. I did boil mine prior to mashing which I have noticed leaves them to excrete a little liquid when reheating. Someone below said they only roast them in the oven and then mash. Next week will try that.      I'm not sure about the others but I eat the same for lunch all week, and dinner will be the same (but diff to lunch). I might switch around vegetables, spices, proteins and rice/card options. 
For me, it is easier to do this as I am also sharing a fridge/freezer with 4 other people.      Will definitely try this next time. Thank you!     I live in Dubai, UAE. We rent our current house and the landlord never really allocated a 'laundry room' or cupboard in the house. Probably because most local people here will hire a maid who has the washing appliances in her bedroom (pretty horrible). 
It is pretty handy to have in the kitchen though :)     Sticky and mushy. Kind of like overcooked rice.     I am currently in the second-ish week of recovery from an eating disorder. I am seeing a dietitian who is helping me by allocating a very specific meal plan that will allow me to gain weight at a healthy rate with clean food. The reason I meal prep is because the dietitian recommended it as a means of avoiding thinking about the food/portioning/calories and being able to avoid eating. 

With meal prepping I am eating on a consistent schedule portioned meals without wasting time weighing/cooking everyday. I still have to focus on school work etc. 

I also love to cook and it is lots of fun to unwind by going to the shops on a weekend afternoon, coming home and cooking. It keeps my mind off other things :) 

Also, I love my mum's cooking and enjoy it for other meals in the day!     Wo ho ho... who said I microwaved it? The fish ones are the only ones I don't pop in the microwave :) The beef and chicken ones I do as they have mashed sweet potato, which is BY FAR better served warm     Hahaha.. I thought my 'slang' might've thrown someone off. I meant it in the same manner as someone who just won a battle or challenge. Kind of as though I destroyed the challenge of week 2 of my first time meal prepping :)     I keep 2 days worth in the fridge after the cook. The rest I freeze and take out the night before and put into the fridge.  Meal Prep Sunday: Week #2 = DESTROYED    IB Physics SL plea of desperation  Hi all!

I am in a slight crisis. During IB1 I endured physics SL classes from a teacher, that I realised later, I couldn't learn from. IB2 has well and truly begun and I am stumped. The class is behind in the syllabus and I am attempting to work ahead into chapters the class is yet to venture into. 

At this stage I know how to use the formulas and I know my definitions... BUT I just don't UNDERSTAND it. The theory, the science, the physics. It doesn't really make sense. 

What would any of you guys suggest doing to be more efficient in my home-learning? Any books I should get, tips I should know, things I should do? Thanks!     I think I will do steamed. Thanks for your help :)     I completely forgot about cauliflower! Thanks for the suggestions. I will make sure to incorporate them :)     Regular asparagus here is quite pricey. Baby asparagus is sometimes cheaper. I was thinking about brussels sprouts but can only get them frozen. Yay or nay? 

Thanks for the suggestions :)   Greens veggies: What and how?  Hello Preppers! 


Tomorrow is my prep day (being a school student)... so I am spending a little time tonight to fix up a shopping list. 

I am currently seeing a dietitian who is supplying me with a very choice-limited meal plan so I can avoid thinking too much about food and the quantity of it I am eating. The only choice on there that I have is that with both lunch and dinner, I can eat unlimited green vegetables.

I love my veg, all of them. Especially broccoli. So I am sorted for that. Yet, one can only eat so much broccoli. 

What would you guys suggest to fulfill this element of my dishes? He said to pick the lower carb, fibrous green veg. Thanks.
     What about Rosemary? Lots of lamb roast recipes out there that make the two SHINE!     Hey there! Thanks for your kind words. I really appreciate it :) It is unfortunate to hear about your diagnosis, though I hope you were able to recover well. 

I will make sure to keep in mind the idea of little snack bags with nuts to carry around. They'll be helpful at school, thanks!     Thank you very much! I find that the tupperware is not that great in the microwave so I might go look for some new ones at Ikea soon. 
The cayenne gives it a little kick :D
     Looks amazing! This is 5 lunch days for one person, right? Do you keep them in the freezer or fridge? I am going to be meal prepping for one and will do 4 days at a time but don't know whether my food will keep till the forth day in the fridge.    To what extent can we rely on the perception of the artist to represent history?  Hello all /r/history dwellers! 
I have been thinking a lot the past few days about artistic representations of art in history and how their representation of the history can be influenced by their perception? 

Is the history that is thus being represented, reliable? 
Is it false history?
What are some examples of art pieces that may misrepresent a historic event?

I am simply posting these questions here for discussion. The constant debate with myself in my head was becoming seemingly repetitive.      Hi there! I am currently in a recovery program which is also compensating for strength training 3x per week. I am 168cm, 48kg and 16 years old.


**My diet is as follows:**

Breakfast: 2 eggs scrambled, 50g oats (as porridge), 60g avocado, 1 banana (OR other option) Shake w/ 1 scoop protein powder, 40 walnuts, 100g strawberries, 50g blueberries, 50g oats + a boiled egg.

10am Snack: Apple, Banana and 40g mixed almonds/cashews/walnuts

Lunch: 130g white fish, 110g rice/130g quinoa, green veg unlimited

Probably sneak into airplanes and travel for free.      That's sweet:)  You're given $1000 and a day left to live. How do you spend it?    When shrinks ask ""the question"" what do they do when you say yes?  The question I'm talking about is ""have you had any thoughts of suicide?""

Now, every time I visit the psychiatrist and she asks me this is say no in fear of what would happen if I say yes. Of course I've had thoughts of suicide but I'm afraid if I let her know that she will commit me or something. I'm an adult but I'm still afraid. 

What do they do if you say yes?  How do I switch to ryerson for next year?  I'm a part time student at a university in Ontario but am unhappy with my school...how do I go about transferring to ryerson for next year?     Cutting off most of my hair on a whim-with kitchen scissors. 

2011 was not a good year for me  Those with depression who are currently successful in life, how do you do it?    Has anyone else dealt with this effect from smoking?  I've smoked weed for about 5 years now and I distinctly remember the third time I got high I had the worst time ever. I think it was a precursor to what would happen later on but I still kept smoking. 

Basically I have depression and a family history with mental problems. My mom told me when she smoked weed she had a total freak out. Same with one of my relatives. 

Anyways I knew smoking while depressed can either help or hinder but I was stupid. I smoked every day after school and all of a sudden I just became detached from my body. I don't feel like I'm ""living"" anymore. I feel like I'm not physically present and I'm just watching myself from the outside. I'm so stupid because I continue to use marijuana and each time I'm high I have a scary out of body experience which worsens how I am sober. When I'm high and think ""this is happening. This is real."" I start to panic and freak out. My mind is so fucked up and I can't physically feel anything anymore or remember most things. 

I've honestly ruined my life by smoking weed and wish i had never started. I haven't smoked in almost a month because I'm too scared. Is there anyone else who has had an experience similar to this?

     There's a cute lil heart shaped pepperoni on the bottom right corner. Looks yummy.      I would say don't do it. Your life is yours to live and at the end of the day no one can stop you from taking it. But why would you end something with so many possibilities. I don't know if you're talking about yourself, OP, but please don't do it. There are so many times I wanted to end my life but the thought of ending my life before I've even begun to let myself live it just wasn't worth it.      TBH I think we will end up as they did in wall-e...hovering blobs of fat orbiting in space     Shitty weather, shitty phone companies/reception, shitty Netflix, shitty exchange rate, shitty shipping and handling prices...and Canada geese (aka satan's spawn)

Cheers to skipping grad! Saved me about three hours of my life by not going.      He's a drunk and makes very rude/uncomfortable comments and literally sexualizes everything.      I honestly think it's the same with guys...most people have Instagram, Twitter etc to post about their lives and to sort of ""one up"" each other. You can be anybody you want on social media. The more followers the better. Posting pictures help with self validation and the anticipation of what comments you'll get is exciting. With girls I think that it's important that we establish that we have a life, are cute and are interesting. It's something I never really understood to be honest...why people have to constantly post pictures of what they're doing/eating just for a bunch of likes from people they don't even know.   What did you end up doing on your prom night?       Bacon.      In all honesty, when there's a comma in my bank account balance.

What are some trusted online shopping sites which don't charge a lot for shipping?  I recently was looking at a nice pair of shoes online and they were such a good price...only problem was when I went to check out, shipping came out to $30 and an additional  10 per item! I live in Canada not some remote place.

I'm thinking of going on a solo vacation to a resort for a week. I'm not interested in a cruise or anything else; I just need some sun and to relax. I'm 19 but pretty independent. Has any woman here traveled to a resort alone?      I wouldn't say they completely helped. They made me happy but didn't fix my problems. It was weird.      Wellbutrin, Prozac and cipralex. My GP prescribed them     You could invest in a bread maker whether it's new or used. Or you can make some stovetop bread like pita, naan and English muffins. I've made pitas plenty of times and they're pretty cool to make.      Probably Italy. That's my heritage and I feel like there's so much more history and culture as opposed to where I was born.

What is some advice you'd give you former self?  Does anyone else with bad skin get all happy and then remember your skin is awful?  I'll get excited and plan stuff and then I remember that my skin is absolutely awful and limits me to what I can and cannot do. :(  Where is your happy place?     [Serious] Ladies, are there any ethnicities you will not date?  [removed]  What's your favourite meal of the day and what do you usually have for it?       Yeah! The watermelon one is my fave  PSA for when you want an iced (sugary) drink  It's almost summertime and that means slurpees galore...

Well it turns out that slurpees and other Icey drinks are pretty horrible for you. So I have a recipe for those of you who still want your iced drinks, but want a low calorie and low sugar option. 

Simply grab  frozen fruit of your choice. Throw it in the blender with two squirts of no calorie drink mix (I like lemonade), some stevia, and however much water you want. Blend it and serve. 

It's low calorie, low sugar, and will satiate your slurpee craving for under 100 calories for two cups.    What makes you immediately swipe left ok tinder?

I'm interested in either working or volunteering for a long duration in the dr. I was wondering what reputable sites and sources I can go to. Also, I'm a 20 y/o female with only a high school education so would that be a problem? Thanks     Yeah that does seem to make sense!  I just weighed myself...  I just weighed myself after finding the scale my mom hid from me. 

It said 130lbs. Last summer I was 119. I don't know how to feel about this number. I knew I'd gain weight in my recovery but I feel so fat. 

I'm hoping that it says 130 because I ate a shit ton of fruit and drank a lot of water today. I'll weigh myself tomorrow morning so here's hoping that it's somewhere in the 120s.   [Skin concerns] Are there any supplements/pills that help reduce oil on the face?  I have super oily skin and if I don't spray a setting spray on my face after putting on makeup, it's like an oil spill. 

When I was on accutane it was great because my face didn't get oily at all. Now, a year later it's super oily again. 

Are there any supplements or pills I can take that will help reduce oil production?  I just need to vent  No flair bc I'm on mobile

Basically I've always had a horrible relationship with food. I had an eating disorder when I was twelve and recovered through that. 

I grew up listening to my mom reminisce about when she was a size zero and listen to her say mean things about those who were overweight. I became so scared she would look at me and judge me, that I starved myself.  

My highest weight was 143 lbs when I was 17. I ate horribly, didn't exercise and was stressed out. I started running every day and I'm about five months I was at 130. 

When I began work I decided that I would only eat breakfast and a snack. In two months I was down to 119. I can't express to you how it felt to see that number. 

But it wasn't good enough (it never is, is it?) I wanted to be skinnier. I wanted to be 100 lbs. And when my mom dragged me to the doctors a month later and I stepped on the scale to see 126 lbs, I cried for the rest of the night.  

I realized I had a serious problem. But now it has gotten worse. I hate my body. I hate it with a passion. My arms are rolls of fat, my legs are horribly huge. My face is disgustingly fat and I hate having my photo taken. 

I can't eat a normal meal without throwing it up. I eat my breakfast and some fruit.  Anything other than that I have to throw it up. I'm so afraid of gaining weight. I just want to be skinny. 

It felt so good to hear ""you're so skinny"" even though I didn't believe it at the time. I miss it.      When I was younger and driving with my well-off friend, her mom accidentally pulled into a Hyundai dealership lot. She immediately said ""ew a Hyundai dealership"" and my friend began mock-gagging just because they drove a Jaguar. I was like...what is wrong with Hyundai cars??   Any recommendations for a lightweight, full coverage foundation or Bb cream?  I have really oily skin, uneven texture due to acne scars and hyperpigmentation. 

I currently wear Clarins 12 hr foundation and I find it has ok coverage but feels heavy and sinks into my pores. 

I've tried revlon colorstay, ReMarcable foundation, KVD lock-it, Tarte BB cream. None of them have lived up to their hype. 

I just need a full coverage foundation that isn't heavy and won't melt off!     Clarin's 12hr foundation smells like cucumbers:)     www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/emeril-lagasse/homemade-bagels-recipe.html     Really? I ordered about $100 of stuff from their website and received it in less than a week.      I know right?! How lazy of me     Basically bought two small portions of salmon. Took a mixture of salt and brown sugar and coated them really well and wrapped them in plastic wrap then placed them on an upside down bowl inside of a container. I then put a plate on them and smooshed them down and plastic wrapped that. 

Left it in the fridge for about 5 days and flipped the fished every day. All of the juices collected at the bottom so I knew it was working. When you want to serve it just rinse the fish until all the salt mix comes off. Then slice it and enjoy!

It's pretty damn good and all you need is some patience as it is a low matenience recipe!

Thanks btw!          Yeah they are pretty ugly aren't they? Recipe called for twelve I said fuck it and made 7 huge ass motherfucking rings of orgasmic bread. Also used a recipe which took less than two hours because I was pressed for time. They were some of the best bagels I've made so far-as I was told since I don't eat bagels.    Tonight's spread: homemade bagels with cream cheese and home-cured salmon       So pretty:)  Homemade gnocchi with meatballs       Yeah I get really awkward and function like a little girl with a crush:/     Wow good luck!!

Good luck!     Oh my god that sounds too good to be true!    Which word's spelling and pronunciation bothers you the most?    Looking to transfer for next fall...what should I do?  Hey guys so currently I'm a part time student at a university in Ontario. I don't like my school or my program and am thinking of transferring universities. At the end of May I'll only have two courses done. 

 I was looking at OCAD and was wondering how hard it is to get in? I would say I'm pretty good at drawing/painting and am very creative and want to pursue something in art. I also saw their BA degree but it says you have to submit an essay?

If anyone could give me some insight as to what OCAD looks for and what the whole campus feel is like, that'd be much appreciated! 

Or if anyone has any other program or school suggestions that are art-based and in Toronto, that would be great :)     DO NOT EAT RAW COOKIE DOUGH
  What strange childhood habit have you carried on into adulthood?    What are some hobbies that are good for the soul?  So recently all I've been doing is baking. Every. Single. Day. I find its a great stress reliever however I always end up eating too much of what I make. The problem is I have an ED which when combined with my baking, isn't good for my health. 

What are some hobbies you guys have that help your mental health and your physical health?      The high school I attended was super religious and had stupid rules about almost everything. Kids who went there were mean af and just ruined the whole HS experience for me.      Honestly I don't see myself living past 30. Maybe I'll reach 25 if I'm lucky. I'm so alone in this world, always have been and always will be. I'm stubborn and unhappy. Can't see myself successful, married or having kids. Either my ED is going to kill me, or my depression will cause me to either kill myself or just stop takin care of my health.      Literally just ate an apple a day and did lots of strenuous work. Lost tons of weight which of course I gained back but I learned that if you just eat less and move more weight will be lost     My birth. I finally was in the flesh instead of a pruney blob floating in a sac of amniotic fluid :)  What is your weird food habit?  I just realized that maybe eating tomato sauce straight from the jar isn't all that normal...

So what are some of your odd food habits?     Delicious waxy regrets     People who don't use their signals (bonus if they cut in front of you)     Caffeine      Make dildo moulds and sell dick shaped ice pops:)     Your parents having sex  Does anyone have an ""all or nothing"" food?  I'm talking about the food you can't have in the house because you'll literally eat it all in one sitting. 

Mine is peanut butter.      Oh man I dont even want to think about that...  What is something you will never tell your kids about yourself?       Have good connections. Dress smart.      Mine was 'Cheese lips'

I used to lick my lips so much that under my nose got so red I guess it looked like nacho cheese  What was your nickname when you were a kid and what did you do to earn it?       Melatonin. That shit will knock you out.      Took a trip to the east coast when I was younger. A hurricane came along(I think it was Bill) and we were stuck in an inn right in front of the ocean. Literally right in front of it. 

So the night before it hit I thought we were going to die so I hit up the lobster buffet and then gorged myself on seafood chowder. Workers then came to board us up inside our rooms so there was no way we could leave or see out the window. 

Morning hits and the power is out so no tv but we listened to the radio. Spent the day eating froot loops with no milk and crying with every gust of forceful wind I heard. Took a nap and when I woke up the storm was dying down. Wasn't even that bad to be honest. I was young so of course I thought the worse. It made for a cool story though. 

Tl;dr: went to New Brunswick,  got stuck in hurricane, ate a bunch of froot loops and didn't die.   What is something you do that you thought was normal until someone pointed out that it was creepy?       When I'm sad I tend to spend money on stuff I wouldn't rationally buy when I'm happy so I would say that I waste more money when I'm sad; not necessarily spend more b     OH MY GOD haha! I did this once! The guy was so pissed off at me but it was such a good laugh  What was your best response when a guy asked you for nudes?  Ugh...let me start out by saying I'm totally fine with people sending nudes and you do you etc etc. BUT I am so tired of guys that ask for nudes and when I say 'no', they start with the guilt trip and the classic ""it'll only be seen by me.""

What are some ways you've trolled guys who do this?     Recipe I used was allrecipes.com/recipe/6749/ciabatta/?internalSource=search%20result referringContentType=search%20results

Let the starter sit for 24+ hrs and it was delicious!     Went to go ride the roller coaster when I was younger but I didn't meet the height requirements      Bagging items  When is the worst time a case of the serial shits could hit you?    What's something everyone should learn before they move out on their own?    What's one thing parents are expected to teach their kids that you taught yourself?       My parents always work(ed) late so around dinner time I started to cook the basics (like eggs) and then discovered that cooking was pretty cool. Read some cooking books and played around with recipes. Taught myself most of what I know. Mostly now I just bake but I find both cooking and baking to be very relaxing hobbies...minus the cleanup.   DAE find that those who drive luxury vehicles use their signals less than those who drive other cars?       When there's that silence when you're alone together and you know you both want to kiss...just go for it. Lean in and if she reciprocates the feelings she will let you kiss her.      Exiting the womb 

0/10 would not recommend      Put a cucumber behind them when they're drinking out of their water bowl      anything by Ray LaMontagne, Damien Rice     Makes sense  What's one thing you should do before stepping into your car?       Being behind a slow walker with bad b.o     Elaine from Seinfeld .      It may be time to sit down with your dryer and talk to it about the dangers of drugs      Do you know how hard it is to fold cardboard into a circle?!     Please don't apologize! 

I may not be the best for  advice like this seeing as how I handled my situation but I think you should just let him know the truth and don't get too caught up in it!     It's awkward as hell.  I was pretty upset with them because they basically ruined something that could've made me happy. 

Does he like you though? Because if he does then it'll still be awkward but you can still work with that.      Robot Dick      I'd guess that the Nigerian Prince came through on his word.      Dick shaped lollipop that was made in China. Put it in my closet where my mom ended up finding it.      Some of us actually enjoy wearing makeup and it's kind of fun to put on TBH   What's one thing the opposite sex spends money on that baffles you?       My friends told him. I ran away and avoided all contact.      I noticed that ""Santa's"" handwriting was suspiciously similar to my fathers...upon further investigation and a side-by-side comparison, I came to the conclusion that Santa and my parents were one in the same. This is why I have trust issues.      Spoiler alert  How did you find out Santa wasn't real?       Why do they not make this mandatory to learn in high school...     My coping skill? Locking myself inside my house distracting myself with cooking, cleaning, baking, exercise and painting. Does it work? Yes but only for a short bit of time.      I would not want them to find the password to my phone    Women who've had a surgical procedure/s for aesthetic purposes, how has your life changed?  What was the surgery you got?
Why did you get it?
Has it improved or made your life more difficult?

Do you find people treat you differently after you tell them/they find out you've had surgery?

  Women in interracial relationships, how did your families react?  I'm white and find myself attracted to men of other ethnicities. Only problem is my family (mainly my dad) are very traditional. Even if you marry someone of the same skin colour but a different background they get bent out of shape. One of my family members married a black man and they were basically shunned by the rest of the family. So I'm pretty worried that me bringing home a guy who isn't white will cause chaos. 

I'm wondering...those of you who are in interracial relationships, how did your families react? How do their opinions affect your relationship with you SO?     I can tell you that wearing the right size bra is totally worth it. None of that digging feeling or falling straps. Just make sure you go to a specialty boutique or someplace reputable to get fitted. I've heard iffy stories about VS and other chain places about their fitting.      Strangely I hate V8     Usually attraction is a big part of starting a relationship with someone. However my recent fling I didn't find physically attractive at all. I fell for his personality and getting to know him. For me there never was a physical attraction to him which was weird. Unfortunately he has a huge ego and that got in the way but I can honestly say that for some people getting to know a person can bring on attraction vs automatically being attracted to them.      From the time I was 13 until I was 18 I wore a size 34A/B...finally got fitted and have been wearing a 32C since.      ...uhhh yes! Totally...     Yes!     I feel you...I switched to PB2 because I was eating so much of even the natural Peanut butter but alas, powdered peanut butter just isn't the same.      No! Strangely I cannot stand ketchup. I'm talking down about jarred/canned sauce used for pizza and pasta.      Food controls your life. It preoccupies your every thought. It's not seen as something that you need to survive. 

I have EDNOS (eating disorder not otherwise specified) which doesn't fit the spectrum of anorexia or bulimia. I've starved myself but haven't been anorexic. And I purge my food if I feel like it. Currently I eat and throw up if I feel too full. Coupled with my depression, this ED is ruining my life. I haven't gotten my period in over 6 months. My skin is so dry. My knuckles are scabbed. My cheeks are puffed out. My weight constantly fluctuates and I have a skewed self image. I'm tired 24/7 and have no energy. My heartbeat is also not normal. 

With different eating disorders there are different mindsets. However there's always one thing it boils down to: disordered eating. Whether you eat too much, too little, nothing at all, eat then throw up etc. 

Tl;dr: Having an ED is an awful thing that is a mental disorder. I wish I could warn people who think starving/purging is a good idea to lose weight or be happy.      I agree...prom is very overrated and it's just another dance TBH      Yes      I would say for me it's not a deal breaker but it's something that would make me tentative to start a relationship. I also deal with depression and I think two depressed people wouldn't really be the best for each other. Sort of like a Romeo and Juliet situation. 

If I wasn't depressed then I wouldn't mind. But then I wouldn't be able to understand what is going on in their mind and it would be kind of like walking on eggshells. I think with everyone it's different though.      The lovely bones...not really a tear-jerker but I think it's a beautifully sad movie. 

  What did you end up doing on your prom night?  For me I ended up driving my drunk friends around. Then spent the night helping to clean up barf and reassure people they weren't going to die. Such fun. 

 I'm curious as to how many of you had the ""dream"" prom night...you know, go to an after party with your date and end up sleeping together, then got up and went to breakfast together before parting ways. 

     Can't even buy peanut butter because I will eat it all too     :(     The best is breakfast cereal for dinner!      Tomato sauce in the jar or can :))     ...I just really love tomato sauce haha  I just drank a whole bottle of tomato sauce. What food do you have an unhealthy obsession with?       For me, I hate how it allows people to become anonymous bullies online. You can take a picture of someone without them knowing and ruin their lives by posting on the Internet.   [Serious] What do you hate about today's technology?       Potatoes. Technically you could live off only potatoes for the rest of your life.      I think it's like the lovely bones and we all pass over to a good place     Nice choice!     Yes! I heard her rendition and it was pretty good. I think anyone can cover it and it will still sound good.      That's a nice addition     Thanks for reminding me of this song. Forgot how good it is!     I love M83! Thanks for sharing      I was 14. Family member. Trying to stay away from it as of late.      Sad yet beautiful     Ah yes, once again Reddit mobile has come in handy.      Mad world ( piano cover) for me   In the end credits of your life, what song would play?       Aggressive and nasty. I had my eyes open too.      The Call -Backstreet Boys     Yes I would. Because 100k is better than the life that I'm living now.      Honours BA in visual and critical studies or drawing     ""Which hole?""     Snowy, Icy, and slushy.      I think it's stupid that we are expected to live to work and Need to have a job by the time we are 16 in order to get experience for more jobs. As long as you have the drive to get a job and aren't mooching off other people's hard earned money then you do you.      Depends on their circumstances. Unfortunately my mind would jump more to ""lazy"" than loser. Or if assume they're well off.      Alarm: 6am

Source: Celery     Ran down the stairs too fast (carpet), slipped and saw my life flash before my eyes. Luckily the bannister was there to save me. Now I cautiously take one step at a time because there's no need to rush!     ""doing it for the vine""     Throw away your trash instead of littering.      Quit smoking. I'm young and only smoked habitually for a year but it made my anxiety worsen, cost me financially, made me smell like ass and made me miserable. I finally quit cold turkey when my friend who is older and smokes told me that the best time to quit is when you're young. Also I looked at my mom who is a smoker and realized even though she's a year younger than her sister(my aunt), she actually looks about 5 years older. 

     Money, gift cards and some nice pyjamas      Such a great song to run to!  What song makes you feel like you're in an epic movie?       Family member shared some of his stash with me. I was barely 14 and never even thought about smoking weed before he brought it up.      I still care for you but don't feel as deeply I used to about you     I think that we are all humans and that race shouldn't matter as much as it does. No matter how you're brought up, I still think we are all biased towards our own races. That's just how we are.      For me it's colonel...how tf do you get ""kernel"" from that     ""kar-a-Mel"" because that ""a"" is in there for a reason      Oh my god that made me laugh so hard! But i agree 100%     Dogs are so precious   What small thing makes you go from feeling blah to sexy?  Whether it be makeup wise or clothing wise.      Thank you! Congrats on that!!     It's the little things like that make us with depression and anxiety one step closer to a better self!     Three weeks?! That's insane.           This made me laugh! Thanks!  Looking for a dewy looking bb cream, what do you recommend?  I have pink hued skin with acne scars and uneven texture, so I also need coverage. 

I currently use reckon colorstay mixed with the Marc Jacobs foundation but they make me look cakey and I'm sick of wearing foundation every day. 

I'm looking for a lightweight, medium to full coverage bb cream or light weight foundation that will make me look dewy but not shiny. 

Thanks!  I just got my period after almost a year of not getting it. What weird things are you celebrating recently?  I've been dealing with an eating disorder since early this year and haven't got my period since then. I woke up today and there it was...so I guess I'm celebrating finally getting it and returning to good health.

subject3883," Do you hallucinate?        They did, for now. Yesterday was an anger day, today is a sad day. Much easier to deal with. I'm sorry your day was rough too...     Hope today is treating you better.     I do the music thing too, although it's difficult when it's late at night and my roommate is sleeping. 

I don't pull my hair out but I always want to. I've gotten really good at  Charliehorse-ing myself. Seems to work.     I love this. I will definitely be trying this out. Thank you!  My brain won't stop screaming at me.  Just chilling with some whisky and cheesecake, all I want to do is relax but noooo, my brain won't let me. It keeps yelling at me. Stick the fork in your eye. Just do it. Remember that time you fucked up 6 years ago? Yeah that was stupid. You're nothing but a stupid little bitch. Take the fork and do it.

Till I can't take any more and my little rage furyball explodes and I hit myself in the thighs. Feels instantly better. Pain helps so much. A few minutes of calm, then it starts again.

I don't know how to make it stop.     The things on the ceiling.     Used to have major social anxiety. Major as in, completely unable to even order at fast food places, had to wear sunglasses everywhere because otherwise I was convinced everyone was staring at me. This went on for a couple years until I had a sudden realization.

Nobody gives a fuck about you.

Your friends and family, sure, of course. But the dozens/hundreds of people you see every day? They see dozens/hundreds more. You are nothing but a blip on the screen of life for them. Nobody gives a singular fuck. The chick at the counter at Tims isn't going home and judging you in her spare time, she has to serve literally thousands of people in a month. You are nothing to her. She won't even remember your face ten minutes from now.

Bam. Just like that, my social anxiety was gone. Still have a wack of other problems but hey.     I thought so too! Little me had it all figured out; the movie companies would find suicidal people and give them plastic surgery to look like the actors that are dying in the movie.

I didn't figure out special effects until I was 12.      That is exactly what I experience, to a t.      Present drug use is just caffeine, cigarettes, occasional drink, and then a pretty regular weed habit. I used to do a bit of coke, MDMA, and speed though (drug use ~4 years total). Had a particularly bad speed binge about a year and a half ago which had some lingering effects on my brain, I'm sure. Hallucinations began sometime during the drug use I believe, it's kind of hard to tell.

Walls are ""shimmery"" or wavy, dark shadows pass by frequently in the perimeters, phantom smells, sensations of being touched or stroked gently. Plus the auditory hallucinations that you mentioned: seems to be triggered by white noise, voices that are usually angry/loud ie. fighting between two people (usually about me, although I can rarely understand the voices, just a choice word or phrase here and there).      The makeup is incredible, but I just want to say that your makeup-less face literally dropped my jaw. Perfect example of natural beauty.

You've also convinced me I need a white eyeliner like, yesterday.      I'd love to see you do a very natural look - something like bare eyes with long lashes and a peachy-pink lip. I think it would accent your colouring really well! (  I'm staring at your eyes...They look like nebulas. How is that even fair? Please tell me those are contacts.)
      Do you sometimes not cross the ts as well?      This. This right here is why I reddit.      I looked pretty chubby at 5'5 and 140. Not huge by any means, but definitely not small either.

Just do it. Remember that time you fucked up 6 years ago? Yeah that was stupid. You're nothing but a stupid little bitch. Take the fork and do it.

Till I can't take any more and my little rage furyball explodes and I hit myself in the thighs. Feels instantly better. Pain helps so much. A few minutes of calm, then it starts again.

I don't know how to make it stop.     The things on the ceiling.     Used to have major social anxiety. Major as in, completely unable to even order at fast food places, had to wear sunglasses everywhere because otherwise I was convinced everyone was staring at me. This went on for a couple years until I had a sudden realization.

Nobody gives a fuck about you.

Your friends and family, sure, of course. But the dozens/hundreds of people you see every day? They see dozens/hundreds more. You are nothing but a blip on the screen of life for them. Nobody gives a singular fuck. The chick at the counter at Tims isn't going home and judging you in her spare time, she has to serve literally thousands of people in a month. You are nothing to her. She won't even remember your face ten minutes from now.

Bam. Just like that, my social anxiety was gone. Still have a wack of other problems but hey.     I thought so too! Little me had it all figured out; the movie companies would find suicidal people and give them plastic surgery to look like the actors that are dying in the movie.

I didn't figure out special effects until I was 12.      That is exactly what I experience, to a t.      Present drug use is just caffeine, cigarettes, occasional drink, and then a pretty regular weed habit. I used to do a bit of coke, MDMA, and speed though (drug use ~4 years total). Had a particularly bad speed binge about a year and a half ago which had some lingering effects on my brain, I'm sure. Hallucinations began sometime during the drug use I believe, it's kind of hard to tell.

Walls are ""shimmery"" or wavy, dark shadows pass by frequently in the perimeters, phantom smells, sensations of being touched or stroked gently. Plus the auditory hallucinations that you mentioned: seems to be triggered by white noise, voices that are usually angry/loud ie. fighting between two people (usually about me, although I can rarely understand the voices, just a choice word or phrase here and there).      The makeup is incredible, but I just want to say that your makeup-less face literally dropped my jaw. Perfect example of natural beauty.

You've also convinced me I need a white eyeliner like, yesterday.      I'd love to see you do a very natural look - something like bare eyes with long lashes and a peachy-pink lip. I think it would accent your colouring really well! (  I'm staring at your eyes...They look like nebulas. How is that even fair? Please tell me those are contacts.)
      Do you sometimes not cross the ts as well?      This. This right here is why I reddit.      I looked pretty chubby at 5'5 and 140. Not huge by any means, but definitely not small either.      I park far away whenever I drive anywhere. You really won't notice the extra 15/30 seconds spent walking but your body will.   Do you hallucinate?        They did, for now. Yesterday was an anger day, today is a sad day. Much easier to deal with. I'm sorry your day was rough too...     Hope today is treating you better.     I do the music thing too, although it's difficult when it's late at night and my roommate is sleeping.

subject5127,"    I've got the same situation. I was on abilify last year but I've been put on seroquel for around 9 months. I've also gained weight. My doctor is likely to put me on latuda also. I don't know what the side effects are since it seems like all antipsychotics have a shitty side effect  Update on my arm. It's healing and everything is closed. No sign of infection so woo! Going for 3 weeks now.       I will. I'm very used to this. I'm feeling sort of neutral. Not happy or sad, just in between     I had a lot of built up anger. I had a fight with my boyfriend and it sort of just put me over the edge. I'm hoping on going for 3 weeks next time.  First post here. Relapsed after nearly 3 weeks.       I guess not xD     How long did that take to roll?!? That's crazy man, but super awesome. How did your friend like it?     I'm wondering how you accidentally made a candle company :) that's super cool though dude, I'm definitely gonna buy a candle here soon!     I know that feeling. It's scary.     Proud of you! 6 months is a great achievement! Keep going 3     Still a better love story than twilight     I understand but for lack of better explanation that's just what I'm gonna go with.      Not all of them are. If you look at the back of the book there is a page that tells you about each picture.     I don't necessarily thinks it has to have a cause. Some people are just that way.     Great game :D      Not possibly, I've been diagnosed.  That was a few years ago though and I was wondering if it changed since then.     It's from a book called miss peregrines house for peculiar children.      I was thinking the same thing. No one has told me that bipolar is no longer the term used. Seeing as I have the same situation, I'm kinda interested.      /r/fearme     Does anyone know the story behind this?     I've got exactly the same thing. I know where you're coming from. You ever try writing? That's what I do. It helps me try to keep things organized. I can't always speak and say what I want to say, therefore writing makes it easier. I've often written notes to family members too. Just a suggestion, I hope it helps.     Why does this make me think of blade runner?
     Can someone please post a link to his channel? Thanks in advance      While you guys are arguing over it, just bought I'd say that I signed it for ya bud.     Im gonna make a necklace out of it! Best line ever x:     I thought it was beautiful really. Then again I am pagan so I don't know if that's why I don't think it strange but...hey. To each his own     She's an excellent shot though      I like this much better than the original      It's something you don't really get until you've been there. Hopefully you never understand.      God damnit. I all went back and checked.      He's probably a juggalo      Now may be a good time to contact your local priest     I am so glad you came out of it3      Aside from extra fingers and toes it just looks like an ugly baby to me :3     I was thinking that :) it is actually pretty cute
     Read the expressionless ;)     There is nothing minor about that xD     How does this even happen? Party hard?     METAL
     Where the fuck do you think you are? Freaking dumbass. That's the point of this sub reddit. We're assholes here and proud of it.     I'd like to suggest ju-on. It's the original Japanese version of the grudge. It doesn't really relate to the American movie and its in Japanese with subtitles but other than that its a really fucking creepy movie. It's not for everyone but I thought it was really good :)      Say what again mother fucker,  I dare you.      Yeah cause she freakin ate him  My new tattoo    Baked - Episode 1: Grandmas Smoking Weed for the First Time (Extended Cut)- The video that never fails to make me smile       Oh god. I've heard this before but it's still fucking hilarious to me xD     Thank you so much. It means alot to me. Its just hard to change when ive been like this for so long. I really am trying though. Thank you for the support   First relapse in months. boyfriend probably going to jail. out of drugs. back to blades       This freaks me out every time I see it. Something about it is just so wrong.  Biggest nug I've ever bought     Bean, our new bun       That's very German. What does it mean?     Duuuuuudeee     I don't even have to be high for this to mind fuck me      I'm sending you an Internet hug my friend   My new pipe :) It needs a name!    Underweight and back to cutting       I looOooOOOooovvee that book.      This is particularly true for Chinese and Japanese because their language doesn't have L sounds. In Japanese, there are R sounds instead. Katakana is used mostly for English words, and if they have an L in them, the closest sound in Japanese is R. For example, Lemon. Hiragana has only ra, ri, ru, re, and ro sounds. Re sounds closest to Le, therefore it's used in place of the L sound.     Me me me me meeee! I love smoking. It doesn't usually give me the munchies, but the feeling is just so nice. I smoke now because it distracts me from being sad and stressed and it's just nice to forget for awhile, y'know? I'm so glad other people with ED's do this. I thought I was the only one     It's not very pleasant, but drinking warm water makes you feel fuller. I think catching yourself when you're thinking about eating also helps. Eat small amounts and then stay away from the food. Being around it will only tempt you. Do something to distract yourself and avoid people who are eating. Sometimes that's difficult though. Best of luck though! xoxo     Another thing you could do is tap the edges and stuff over a piece of paper      Mine definitely goes through under my lip. That's probably why it's irritated like that. It's placed awkwardly.     Congratulations! You've been adopted.     Never ending story     It has something to do with eggs  Gameplay Questions, motion sickness, overall opinion?  I'm writing a follow up article in my school newspaper about the Oculus, and I was wondering if any of you fine folks would be willing to talk to me about your experiences. Any help is much appreciated! Be as detailed as you can. Thank you so much!          It's in the small boring town of marysville. Very good churos though      It makes me burp a lot   After taking a couple months away from weed, finally smoked. Ended up in town eating Mexican food. [7]       All of whom conveniently had machetes.       I also visit daily :)     It's a bun!     "" dis mine ""     Literally just had one of my worst fears rationalized.     The last one was strangely beautiful     I'm going to find the app right now because my little sister has the exact same one. EDIT: the app is called ghost snap. You can make the exact same effect and mess with transparency and such.     It took me way too long to figure this fucking thing out.  I'm talking hours.     There and back again :)     Faery. Definitely a faery.           Damn      Did they ever find out what made them do that or if they were on anything?     Skywalker fucks with my depth perception. It's not a bad thing, just something I noticed with that particular strain. Does anyone else experience that with it?     Illuminati confirmed     He does have rather puppy-dog looking eyes.     I think you're right. I did a bunch of research on him today and I definitely think its something else.       Damn! You beat me to it!  Snow+fog+cemetery= gorgeous    I haven't cut on my legs in a long time. I'm okay now though and plan on trying to go for a few days without cutting.       That's what I was thinking. Thank you very much for sharing. Gave me some hardcore goosebumps.     I will definitely look into it. Sounds kinda like the movie, Sinister.     Hm, very creepy. Definitely will probably be contacting you to turn this into a short film.     Sweet! I'll be sure to check it out.     That makes me sick to my stomach. Thank you for sharing!     Thank you very much!     I've heard stories like this before! It's possible that there could've been an accident of some sort where people died. I like this story though. We're their faces white? Like slender man? Or were they black? Simply flesh toned with no features?     I don't blame you at all. Something like that happened to me too, at a beach in South Carolina.     I think sometimes seeing nothing is far scarier than seeing something. Very creepy.     That's terrifying! Do you know if there was any sort of death on your property? Other than the animals, I mean.     That's very freaky. What do you think has caused it. Have you had any sort of, I don't know, problem(?) with a mirror before this happened to cause it?     Very eerie! I'd say that's some divine intervention of some sort.     I'm definitely interested in turning this into a short! Can you share the other encounters?     I actually intend to pursue special fx makeup and film directing as a career! I'll be sure to send you a link to some of my other stuff:)     I will definitely look into it! Thank you:) I've heard a few stories of things like that. Would you happen to know who the author of the book is?     That is super creepy! I've had that happen once too! Did anything else end up happening?     Also, I will be contacting you for help and input as I shoot and edit it! Thanks again.     Thank you :) I've done some pretty gory stuff with special fx makeup that makes this look very mild. Stuff like this is my hobby :)     Thank you for your input, I'll be sure to post it there.     Thank you very much. As soon as I get my Skype up and running again, I'll shoot you a message.  What's the scariest thing that's ever happened to you?  In the spring I'm going to start making horror film shorts again and I could use some good ideas. The story doesn't have to be true but if it is, even better. If already looked into some creepypastas but I figure true stories will be better. If you submit a story, I promise I will give you credit once the final film is done and published. Thank you in advance! If you have any questions, feel free to message me.     -_- alright dude. We've been over this already. Kindly fuck off.     Seriously?      That's all and we'll but at least in that subreddit I don't have to worry about judge mental pricks telling me not to. Thanks for calling me things too. Appreciate it greatly.   Still going and going and going       No need to be a dick. It's CREEPY makeup, asshole.  We all have a dark side.       I think this captures the struggle of being a girl gamer when it comes to RPGS perfectly, haha. XD     I do some pretty bad alternatives as well. I guess the main one isn't too bad, but I know what you mean.     Dude, thanks a lot :) I felt stupid for asking. Anywho, you're a lifesaver. Thanks again.  Wondering about Daedric armor.  Can you get it on the Xbox version of elder scrolls? If so, where can I find it?     I haven't been alright in a long time my friend. I appreciate you wanting to help. It means a lot to me 3     Thank you 3   Scarred up       If more people had a morbid sense of humor like we do, it would be more popular. But sadly, that's not the case.     I shouldn't be laughing as hard as I am, but this is so fucking funny. Probably one of my favorite posts.     Thank you :)     I'd suggest hitting up the local drugstore for some melatonin tablets. They work decently but after awhile you start getting tolerant. Good for short term use though until you can see a doctor.      Uhm. Actually that dish is a rice ball with a bit of seaweed as a wrap.       Yeah but they're not all fucked up looking like that is     And this is why I love rob zombie . He's amazing in concert. Definitely one of the best!     THIS ISN'T EVEN MY FINAL FORM     NOPENOPENOPEFUCKINGNOPE     What about the ears and doglike face?     A rat with dog ears? And weird finger things     Can you put something next to it for scale, OP?     That made my day so much better :) thanks OP!     You look like a shiki! Anime fans will get it :3     Haha thank you     Thank you3 congratulations to your nearly 2 months! Hang in there, friend. I know how hard it is.     Actually it means a lot to me. Thank you so much      Thanks :) I really like your account by the way     Thank you :)     Thank you 3     Yes sir! I draw on my arms a lot. Thanks :)  1 month clean today       im in the same situation. I'd be more than happy to talk to you. PM  me and we can talk :)     There can't be a rainbow without rain 3     Only in Australia.     r/shitpeoplesurvive     So proud of you 3 it takes a strong person to try to recover. I know how it is dude, if you ever need anyone to talk to, you've got a whole list of people who'd be willing to talk to you to help you out:)     Sure thing :) message me if you need anything      I get that sometimes. It's just blood that pooled up under the skin. It should be gone within the next few days. Keep an eye on it though.  I don't know if this has been posted here before, but I love it :)       So it would've had to have punctured his lungs and/or airways for it to fill up like that then, right? As well as an artery?     Yeah there's a lot of blood there. It just confused me because I couldn't tell if there was a bullet hole or anything.     Where was he shot at, to be spouting blood like that?     His little paws are so cuteeeeee! I wanna kiss his nose3 your cat is so fucking adorable!     No, they'll always be negative to me. There's nothing romantic or sexy about them. Yes they're healed, but they're like bad memories, constant reminders. I appreciate that you seem to like them so much, but it's for the wrong reason.     Your username concerns me. Also, this was definitely not meant to be sexy. It's scars, from a lot of emotional pain. That's not sexy. A lot of people think they're ugly. Theres nothing good about how they got there or how they look. It's a very negative thing.      That's weird. Please don't.     ????     Thank you 3  Hopefully the last for awhile. Wish me luck.       Is there a problem, sir?  Scars on my legs    He betrayed me after everything we've been through. I love him more than anything still. When I said I'd die for him, I meant it.       Hm. I see what you mean. Sort of a reverse psychology thing?     I could see that, but she's a total bitch to Cordelia. I don't think she would be so mean if she wanted so much for her. Idk.      Isn't this what Hitler did, when Germany was weak? I feel like every time this happens in history we end up with a dictator. History tends to repeat itself. Or what if the symbol person was all a part of the plan?     Someone please explain how this works. I'm so confused.     That's what I meant to say, sorry.     I'm talking about in the far future. Most people being wiped out by nuclear warfare.     This is one of my worst fears. Especially since its completely possible with Russia and everything. It's terrifying to think that everything you know can be destroyed in a matter of seconds. That's how I think the world will end. Nuclear warfare.     It seems like you     I was picturing freaky Fred too, haha.     u/teenagehate18 I'm buying you this      They've changed the design so there's a belt that keeps you from leaning too far     No but I'm trying to find someone. The Omni is the full body system. Have you heard of it?  Omni+ Occulus Rift  I need some opinions on this for an article for my schools newspaper. Any and all help is welcome! Thank you :)

What sort of impact do you guys think it will have on the gaming industry? 
Good things and bad things, etc. 
      u/teenagehate18 look at how cute! It's Thomas :)     This is incredible! Very well done!     Ccccaaaarrrrlllll! That kills people!     - climbs up on stump and truffle shuffles -     Alantutorial!     Aww do I have to???     He did it for the vine.      TRUFFLE SHUFFLE     I'm only 15, but this is something I've always wanted to do. I'd be interested! Just PM me if you'd like to.  Update of the scars on my legs. I'm doing okay, you guys. It's been hell, but somehow I'm managing to stay clean.       That's true. I didn't think about that.     It sounds like they'd start rotting away with time. So secluding the infection would work too, right?     There are all sorts of crazy out there my friend. Have you contacted the police or anyone about it? They could probably trace the files if you manage to dig them up again.     What all do you remember about it? It's possible that you can hunt it down possibly     Well considering there are pictures of him asleep, and pics he clearly didn't take, isn't it possible he could've been kidnapped and had to play it off like he ran away? And this is the kidnapper playing some fucked up joke?     This has been posted a hundred times already dude.     I saw this yesterday and honestly it's one of the scariest things I've seen xD     Thank you sir, for making my day.      Me too     Thank you so much :)     Thank you 3     Well, I think I started realizing how bad it was fucking me up. It took me forever to be able to go this long. I've been doing a lot of reading and meditating though, which seem to really be helping..  Just over 40 days clean       /u/teenagehate18 it's klash!!!!     I already know he does xD     /u/teenagehate18 THIS IS WHY YOU SHOULD STOP TRYING TO EAT MY GODDAMN HAIR     IT'S SO FLUFFEH  Meet my bunny!       Possibly     It's okay my friend! It all sounds the same :)      Alright! Message me and let me know how it goes! :) good luck      Meds can help reduce the thoughts though      I think both are helpful. Don't worry about all the questions. Ask as many as you'd like.      I'd  skip the hospital and talk to a doctor about meds. I've been on all of em xD it's all about finding the right amounts and combinations.      That's what I was admitted for the first 2 times. The group stuff is complete bullshit that doesn't help anyone.     I think it's different depending on why you're admitted. It's very controlled. You go to group therapy sessions for most of the day, and honestly it's the most annoying thing ever. In my honest opinion it's all bullshit. I've been to a few different places and its all the same. It's nothing like in the movies. I thought it was a waste of time but its different for everyone. That's just how my experience was.     I've been in a psychiatric unit...I don't think they really call them mental wards or anything like that anymore.     This is the prettiest cat I've ever seen.     The smell of sulfur usually tags along with something demonic or unholy. Be careful!     That was thoroughly disturbing but the band is great!     I do. I feel like its probably fairly common in this sub.     What?! You're adorable! You be quiet!     It wasn't a clan. It was player on player     I wish they would change it back to the way it used to be.     What was that game called out in the middle of the wild? It's underground. You duel people and you have that little teleporty thing? That was my favorite thing to do. I miss the old runescape      I'm so glad people go out there and help them 3     Well, I'm in the U.S     That sounds fine and dandy but I don't think there are any shelters around me. I still need to research emancipation more because I'm not sure how to go about it     You're right. Thank you. Like I said, I've recently filled out a shit ton of applications but unfortunately I can't get there by foot. I've been trying though. Thank you for your advice     Thank you Teesh 3     I have brought that up before and they just laughed and said yeah right. I wouldn't even know how to go about it anyways. I did just get a job though. I don't know if that would help.     Thank you. That made ms feel better. It just takes a toll on you after awhile, y'know.     I see a counselor weekly     You're right. Thank you so much. I go to counseling weekly and it really helps. I've brought up emancipation before but they just laughed at me. I don't really have anyone to stay with so I just kind of deal with it I suppose.     I'm in counseling.      Never be afraid of who you are. Killing yourself would result in more heartbreak and pain than you coming out anyways. They're your parents. They'll love you no matter what, even if they don't agree with your sexuality. Don't be afraid to DM me if you need anything!     I distinctly remember my first time. I was so young. I was going into 5th grade and it was summer. I've always been bullied, I think that's what caused the buildup. But I also didn't get along with my parents. One day it was particularly bad of a fight. I went into my room, locked my door, and cried for an hour or so. Something sort of snapped in me and I reached over and grabbed scissors off my nightstand and started sawing away at my right forearm. It was surprisingly deep. Right after I had finished and cleaned up the blood, I was confused as to why I did this for I had never heard of people harming themselves in such a way. But I felt this sense of calm and peace roll over my body and I quit crying and laid down to sleep. That was how my 4-5 years of selfharm began.     More like Hell.     That's Venus Angelic      Why would a teabag be covered in blood? xD     u/teenagehate18 we must do this! Also, can anyone translate?     I am so glad things are working out for you dude! That sounds amazing. I don't blame you for leaving. I won't ever have a job that involves me sitting behind a desk or filling out paper work and such. Keep on keepin on:)     Nope. I mean what I asked.     How did you get started on this, as opposed to leaving a corporation? What made you decide this is what you'd rather do?     When were you diagnosed with Down syndrome?     You've lost your muchness, Alice.     u/teenagehate18     Bipolar 2, schizoaffective disorder, major depression/anxiety, PTSD, EDNOS. Also BPD which is a sort of recent diagnosis.     I totally agree with you.     Same with Mussolini and Napoleon. It's unfortunate but that's just how it usually ends up.     Wouldn't we eventually just end up where we are now? Government is always going to be corrupt. Yeah, there are some good guys but the majority is not.      She sings to it  150+ days of no self harm earned me this! A vertical labret piercing  I'm proud of myself.       That's the thing. I can't be happy if I'm 'chubby' believe me I've tried. That's what all rehabilitation centers try to do and after 3 or 4 different places, it's just not possible for me.     At least it was quick.     I've talked to him, the thing is the medicine he wants to put me back on made me gain 30 lbs last time I was on it.     He doesn't deserve a quick death.     This guy deserves the worst death possible. This is one of those cases where I think street justice would be pretty good. I think it should rarely happen, but this guy deserves it.     I agree. I love your username by the way. That made me smile.     I know, but that doesn't change the way they look at me and how it makes me feel.     Thank you so much. I'm trying my hardest, I really am.     People underestimate how far a kind little act can go.      I could only hope one day it would get better, but at this point I don't think it will.     I've already been diagnosed with severe depression, anorexia Nervosa, and BPD.     It used to be music, but there's really nothing for me anymore.     You're so right. Thank you for this comment. That makes me feel better.     Don't give up so soon. If there are things you can do to fix your situation I think you should try. I know you don't want to but there's a chance that things will get better and you'll improve. It may take a bit, but if you just stick it out, just think. Everyone is destined for something great, but if you give up now, you may never know. I wish there was something I could do to help other then just give you kind words. If you need anyone to just listen to you, feel free to message me. Update us? Let me know if anything happens or if you start to figure things out. I'd love to talk to you and help you in anyway I can. Stay strong, friend.     Having experienced this, it's like a gift from the weed gods.     Jeff the killer...?     At least she has manners :)     Agreed     This pretty much sums up a lot of Ohio. I live near Columbus and can confirm.      Yes. This is it. This is its destined name.     Name her Chessie! Like the Cheshire Cat :)      Please don't waste your time being upset over someone you hardly know. I don't want you to be sad, I just wanted to be heard.     I've already tried so many times to enjoy life.      I just don't see the point anymore. I'm glad you say you care, but there's nothing about me to be told.      Thank you :)     This scar is 5 or 6 months old     Thank you! I'm definitely going to look into some of these. I already use scar cream and vitamin oil. No progress so far.  Does anyone know how to get this scar to not stick up so much? Why is it like that?    Drinking and weightloss, my new drug of choice. Been so hard not to cut. I'm not doing too well.       Smartass xD that was pretty funny.     Can i get an AMEN?!      Thank you for posting this3 you just made my day     This one is especially terrible xD     No. It's a horrible ' OC ' that's really fucking stupid and a ripoff. Highly unoriginal.     Nina the Killer. It literally does not get any stupider.      What's the craziest thing you've had to deal with      I also enjoy doing special fx! I plan on pursuing it as a career actually. What's your favorite thing to work with?      I'm in the same boat as you. Went through the same thing. I never told them and I think it's probably better that way. It will make things a hundred times easier if you just go with it. It sucks, but in the long run it will probably save you from an unnecessary fight or two.     Has anyone else noticed that there has been a lot of talk and activity surrounding the 'end of days'? Wonder if something really is coming.      I'm sorry...?     What's the book about? It sounds interesting, and I need a new series to start ^_^     I'm a female and I'm solitary, mostly due to the fact that there are no other wiccans in my area that I know of. I'd love to be in a coven though. I prefer natural magic. Though I prefer using tools in spells ( I just feel like it centers and enforces it better ) I don't always. I have never tried anything with the weather, other than enjoying its energy, or using it for meditation purposes. My family didn't take me serious at first and didn't want me learning about the craft, but now they are accepting of it since they understand it better now.     DO A BARELL ROLL  I'm a Wiccan who was raised in a Catholic household! AMA.       So basically your religion goes against human nature? That makes sense.     I see no other explanation.  Inspired by alligator_sky, my different form of self harm.       Step away from the window...     That's eyeless jack. Wrong catchphrase though.      She looks so suspicious.     I've been searching for this comment :) I'm glad someone said it.     Plus since the entry wounds are on the front of the leg, that would suggest they didn't turn, but was instead facing said explosive.     You look great! Hush!     I'm proud of you! Good job! How are you feeling?     I'm glad I can help! Be strong! We believe in you     Thank you!      Proud of you! Definitely should post a pic.     Thank you! It still makes me nervous, believe me. But you can do this!! Don't be ashamed, love.     Thank you      Thank you so much! This is super helpful   Learning not to give a fuck about what people think of my arms. They tell a story, and one with a happy ending as well.       I think the few times it happens is because of rage and anger. For the hell of it though? That's pretty rare. Sociopaths usually exhibit high amounts of self control.     Love the piercing and the dreads :)     Wow that's really pretty! I've never seen this before. How much did it hurt to get done? It looks really good.      It's definitely best to wait until it's healed. That way you won't have to deal with infections which suck. I tried the same thing. I had just gotten a single lip piercing off to the side and i tried to change it too soon, it ended up red and infected and all around uncomfortable. I took it out and waited for it to heal and go away then got a different lip piercing. Definitely wait though.     I definitely think that it could be moved over a little towards the corner of your mouth, but I also think it wouldn't be that big of a deal if you kept it the way it is.  My vertical labret piercing       She's super pretty!     Sure thing! If you have any other questions just let me know:)     Thank you! I'm just hanging out.     This really didn't hurt. The worst part was the soreness after.     Me tooooo      Thanks          Thank you so much      Thank you!     Is your neighbors name Donnie Darko?     Maybe they were really big rats.     I agree with that. It's actually pretty cool to listen to.     It looks like it would sing Mexican death metal.   Honey bun       Those are guinea pigs     I still say it's worth a watch.     Yeah that's true. Still, it'd be pretty funny at first though. What if there was one super buff toddler that just kicked the shit out of the rest?     I would pay some good money to watch that     Just in case, dude.     That seems safe.     Time to play...GUESS THAT POKEMON!!!     It doesn't cure cancer but it really does change things. Before my grandpa died of stage 4 lung cancer he wouldn't eat anything, and was depressed all the time. Well, we made him some brownies and he finally ate, felt and looked better, and could at least smile again. Seeing someone who's been so sick like that finally smile and eat is pretty amazing. So yes, long story short, it can be very very beneficial for cancer patients, but it certainly doesn't cure it.     You're gorgeous!      That's definitely a chipmunk     Witnessed that crash. It was brutal. The guy was being an asshole and speeding though. I was stuck in traffic for an hour and had to sit there and stare at the guys severed head before they finally covered it up.     So cute!     Awh! How old is it?      He looks so grumpy! Give him birthday cuddles :)     "" stay still! I clean you!""     Okay, thanks :)     So if I get 300 comment karma I can still request?      So cuuuuttteeee     I love that band!      As in Abney Park?     It's a ghost. All you gotta do is burn it's bones :) simple enough.     Hm. I noticed that too, mostly on Instagram.     Supernatural fangirl for life      Thank you so much     Thank you      Not in my swamp!     AMA!!!!  Somewhere around 200 days clean. Top of one arm, bottom of the other. My arms look relatively the same on both sides.       Congratulations!     Don't worry. This is the first time I've ever seen it. I think it's pretty neat and slightly creepy!     Dude, that's perfect. And I love that show too :)     Alright      How so?     Maybe try runes?      I'd also recommend using obsidian for its protective qualities if you haven't already. Keep us updated     Anytime!      Mine weren't too accepting at first but when they learned more about it they felt better. I'd say introduce them to the idea slowly and see how they react.     Great question! I think it would be that it's nothing like Hollywood makes it out to be. It's not evil in any way shape or form.     I'd read about it before in a book and something just clicked. After that I just began researching it more and more and found it resonated strongly with me     I have no clue dude. Ask someone else.      Jeff...?     I'd also look into some protective charms. Onyx is a great little stone. Carry one with you and in your pocket and especially in your sleep. I hope you find something that helps OP!     Is it the Shaye Saint John guy? I never saw this video on his channel on YouTube but this is still unsettling as fuck.     One of the things that never fails to scare the shit out of me.     This is the first time I've seen moobs on a cat. Was not disappointed.     He looks like the dragon from The Never Ending Story.     Gives me goosebumps every time. I could hardly imagine.     Ill post it into this subreddit once it's finished :)      A lot      That's crazy :) I hope you don't mind that I directly quoted your experience for my article.     Wow this was super helpful :) thanks for answering :)     Thank you so much for your reply. It helps a lot, especially to have the point of view of a scientist!     God damn 0_0  Need help for school newspaper  I'm writing an article for my school's newspaper about cryptids and I was wondering if you guys would answer a couple questions for me. Any and all help is appreciated!
Questions",1
subject5711,"    Yes cats make people fat because dog people go for walks ( FYI i LOVE cats i have 1 but i have 2 dogs)      when they say that people must find fat woman attractive but they will only date fit men      well they might be setting them selves up for failure just so they can say that it doesn't work also i find that a lot of obese people want to have anorexia ( i do know that overweight people can develop anorexia but they won't stay obese due to the fact that anorexia will make you lose LOTS of weight).
also they think that its a quick fix oh if i don't eat for 2 days ( YAY right) then i can eat all i want for the next 3 weeks because it will equal out.     I Don't care about spelling make me a mod :) hehehe.  [Meta] Fatlogic Contradictions  [removed]     yes i will add that eating 0 calories 2 times a week won't make up for the 5000 you eat on the other days. But specifically i meant if you weighed your self then didn't eat for 2 days and were exercising you could not then weight your self and have put on weight. if that makes any sense.      the doctors and science are very clear its not possible to not lose weight it you go days with out eating ( EAT LESS+ MOVE MORE= LOSE WEIGHT) it is scientific law when it comes to weight loss. 
so when people say they can go days with out eating and they exercise all the time but still gain weight they are lying. you would lose at least water weight you CAN NOT put on weight if your putting in less calories then you are burning. Sorry fat logic you cant and she wants so much to know its not her fault but it is.     YAY dick jokes.     You should try therapy.     so it smells like smoke?     LOVE LOVE LOVE to be a mod I'm on like 24/7.     Facebook has lead to an increase in depression among young adults and teens.

people are also developing FOMO and that is fear of missing out 

look it up its true      'Murica

     NASTY!!!!!     I don't care what people say about oh i eat only lettuce and i never stop working out but i still weigh 500 pounds.

NO matter what you say if you are eating LESS calories then your BURNING you will not gain weight its not scientifically possible.

don't care what you say is wrong with you thyroid problems only cause maybe 50 pound weight gain and medications from a DR will reverse that 
as well there are NO conditions (apart from fat logic) that make it IMPOSSIBLE to lose weight just more difficult. BOTH my parents are doctors.     i cant she moved across the country for me   Just try to give a shit  my partner has ZERO empathy for me if i get hurt all she says is "" Well i didn't feel it"" her exact words. There are times when i just need to cry and i get told to stop it and I'm acting like a child.
if I'm cold she says "" well I'm not so i don't know why you are"" as if i have to be warm because she is.

this is just a few examples of what happened in the last 2 days      could you have been drunk 
maybe you sleep walk 
were you drugged 

there really are thousands of possibilities

ALIENS      i agree with it being really expensive but with an obesity epidemic do people really need pizza. HAHAHA just kidding try looking up pita pizza recipes they are super fun and taste so good.      i just don't see anything wrong with hating a spacific group everyone does hating black people just has a name 
everyone hates everyone thats just how the world works i am never mean to black person never in my life i simply choose not to be friends with them or place my self around them on purpose.     i am racist  (there is NOTHING wrong with that ) and i chose to apply to different housing on the grounds of different religion and beliefs i got moved in a few days 

its not worth it to stay there if your not happy   I Hate the sound of guitars  [removed]     Ok thats it  i am officially mad I'm sick and tired of TITP and FA people getting mad at woman because they look good every single picture of someone thinner then them in bashed into non existence  now who the FUCK is body shaming.
How dare get to flaunt around your FAT( that is a term you like right) body and tell us that we HAVE to love it and then a thin woman posts a picture of something  she WORKED for and you treat her like shit.
Go FUCK yourselves      yea sorry i have a voice recognition softwere program and its really bad at punctuation sorry.         i always forced my self to have sex to make her happy but then i just couldn't make my self do it anymore. i began to feel violated because i really didn't want to do it.     i have tried for years to enjoy it and have fun and feel good but it doesn't not for me anyways.     yes only because i am a very emotional person and i think you cant have sex with out emotion i just think that sex is a waste of my time      there is no injury or illness i just really hate sex      i have been told i cant be asexual because i like to kiss and make out once or twice a year     because i really do love my wife but i just don't like physical relationships      What was the White pride website called i would really love to know?   I HATE sex  i have had sex with about 6 different people in 6 years men and woman 
and i have NEVER liked sex ever 
i don't think its fun i don't think it feels good i am currently married to a woman and she thinks i don't find her attractive because we don't have sex anymore but in reality i do think she is very attractive and sexy but  i only have sex when it gets to annoying to handle her begging anymore
i want to kiss and cuddle but other then that i don't want to be touched. 

P.S i am a female and i am 20 and no i have not been sexually abused       its odd that you have an ED i have severe anorexia maybe theres something about having mental illnesses yourself makes you need to take care of other people.     do you mind if i ask how you dealt with it 
and or what came of it sorry if thats to personal.  You Have No More Options  My S.O has a lot of mental health problems she's always telling me that one one will help her the problem is we cant help her anymore she will not take ANY medication even if it helps and it does 

she REFUSES counselling or therapy and will not even consider going and so the doctors place her in the hospital she then stays for a few days then lies her way out.

then she gets really angry that no one will help her and gloating that she was right and they won't do anything for her.

she just doesn't realize that there are NO MORE options for her 

she won't take any help thats offered and does not see that they are giving every option they had and you won't exempt any of it.
P.S i have a software that types for me do to a physical disability and its really messed up with punctuation so i apologize its all messed up      i agree so much but then i sound even more like a dick      i am right there with you trust me 
but my girlfriend ( yes we are both girls hahaha) thinks its funny as hell to torment me about it i cant really say much to make you feel better but its nice to no that your not alone here   Suicide  i don't think we should stop people from killing them selves i mean its there life

why should we stop them from doing what ever they want 

i have a S.O that is constantly suicidal and theres nothing i can do about it other then tell her what to live for but ultimately thats all i can do 

( and yes i have REALLY tried to get her help but she turned down medication and won't take it 
refuses counselling and hospitals won't take her seriously anymore because they just admit her she lies then gets out and does it all over again oh ya then gets mad that no one will help her)     yes i believe that all fast food should be illegal or you should get a card once a month that you must pay for it and every time you buy fast food it should be stamped with no more then 5 a month   Fat shaming  i LOVE to fat shame i devote about 6 hours a day to fat shaming 
and because i hate fat people so much i actually keep myself 99LBS at 5feet6inches 
if i see that your overweight or obese i will shame 
and thats NOT a crime     because pot is just as bad as smoking it still cause lung cancer and people say that pot is good for you but they thought that about smoking for over a century and then they realized that its bad for you     Yes as a matter of fact yes they should be   Pot should stay illegal  no i don't believe that it should be legalized i think that everyone who smokes it should go to jail and that liquor should also be illegal      i consider it a confession because people say to me that i am encouraging Eating disorders amongst kids.  Obese child  I will not let my child be fat every i cant allow it i will do anything to prevent it from happening.   Who else just hates Mary?  I can't stand her I don't exactly know why they chose to bring her back just for her to abandon the boys and cause more trouble then she is worth 

I want to know how many people agree with me   Cheapest groceries  I will be moving to Hamilton in June

If anyone has any suggestions that would be great      I lived in brantford for 10 years from 7-18 and left a few years ago 

The hams in brantford is insanity
I will fully agree with you on this   Meghan Trainor - ""All About That Bass"" PARODY    My apartment stinks but I cant seem to fit it  [removed]  Move my wedding date  It's 30 hours till my wedding 
My mother just yelled at me for 45 minutes to move the date because it's inconvenient timing for her 

I just needed to get that off my chest I really have no one to talk to   (F/d) incest videos  [removed]  Free incest porn sites  [removed]  Mother won't take my brother to a doctor  I have a 6 year old brother and he has not seen a doctor since he was 2. Because she believes that Doctors with force her to give him vaccinations and make her give him medication (he deffenitly has autisum and ADHD but has not been diagnosed) he also won't eat anything they have to constantly nag him to eat he weighs about 43-46 pounds at 4 feet tall 

I'm worried about him I don't know if I'm wrong or right could maybe a parent help me      No I don't consider myself any sexual oriantation I just date who ever I want sorry for the mix up       I'm still madly I love with my first boyfriend and its been 5 years and I'm now married 

I don't think I will ever not be in love with him when I say his name or I hear it I get butterflies      my wife loves to wear shoes in the house so we bought her house shoes
we both win. 

i don't want dog shit, dirt or god knows what all over my floors because i put my feet on the couch then maybe i will lay down i don't want it transferred to my face.

     no reals only feels     you can try 

/r/confession if you want there good or 

/r/offmychest     yes i fully agree with you 
 
no matter what you say your getting in trouble 

     i have a disability and i don't want hand outs i do collect disability in canada but only because they cover wheelchair repairs that can cost a minimum of $1000 for 2 freaking tires      thats actually awesome advice for a teenage boy. hahaha     ever visited /r/raisedbynarcissists ?  What is the worst advice your parent's ever gave you?       Most people who are suicidal do NOT talk about the fact that they are suicidal.

people who are truly suicidal won't talk about it they will just do it.     mine is also so obsessed with autism and if theres a vaccine committal on tv she will flip out      i do agree with you a lot of this stuff happened 200+ years ago and people are still using it as an excuse to be an asshole     crab mentality      in my opinion she's not even that thin 

its just that we are all basically wearing fat goggles its becoming normal to see overweight people that when someone is really actually a healthy weight we see them as to thin.     my mother also will diagnose complete strangers with having vaccine poisoning and stuff ( she is so against vaccines that when i got mine with out telling her she got so angry i thought her heart would stop)     i am terrible at grammar we didn't spend any time on it in school deal with it.

in my school we mainly just spend time on doing cursive ( that no one used)     i fully agree my sister has 2 kids in a row they are 11 months apart 

if she says to me one more time ""im tired"" i will kill her      technically it is good job  Is your Nmon/Nparents Fear Mongers  my mother is very against a lot of things mainly the Government teachers and doctors. Now i don't agree with 99.9% of what she's says but she loves to talk about it 

for example i have a disability and have to spend a lot of time around doctors ( not since i had lived with them because she believes the will purposely kill you)

but when i move i will get a doctor again and plan on getting a full physical but my mother is getting upset about it 

they will kill you, they don't know what they are doing, its all for money( we live in canada) among other things 

even though i don't believe her, do to my very very bad anxiety about death  i am terrified to get my chest pain looked at because they will kill me because they don't know what they are doing or about diseases .

btw my mother has NO degree she just has been looking at Harvard research papers for a few years and she only has her GED 

but she is raising money to put her own medical lab in the house because she doesn't trust doctors

i don't know what to do she knows i have very bad anxiety and she still tells me this all the time 

Sorry for the rant i just needed to talk about it 

btw sorry if its hard to understand I'm just really upset       you just made my week      one that bugs me is 

"" if you don't find fat people attractive your a terrible person""

""i don't find fat men attractive and thats ok""
     i am not from a incest relationship but i have a deadly genetic disease anyone can get horrible diseases so i don't think its any diffrent      i don't see anything wrong with it your not forcing any one and they rant forcing you

have at it      please tell me how it goes with yours because I'm have the same situation I'm moving and my brother is 6. he is my world and I'm really the only one who gives him attention or listens to him 

I'm very worried that he will think i don't love him and i don't want to see him 

sorry I'm no help but i just thought yyou would like someone to relate to      there adults let them be     i lost my virginity at 13 with my 18 year old bf on the couch with my gramma across the room on the computer   TITP Contradictions  what is your fave one mine is 

"" weight loss is impossible""

""i don't lose weight unless i work out non stop and NEVER eat""  I don't think incest is bad  as long as incest is between 2 ( or more) consenting adults of age then i don't think its that bad and people should relax about it 

and no i am not in an incest relationship and don't plan to be      its really all internal but i get to go once in a while      some comments are offensive but she's a mean person so i am kinda used to it      when my wife and i got together we never talked about religion and then we got married in a ceremony at the court house ( i wanted it this way) 

but i am a christian and my wife HATES christians she calls then whores and evil so for the last 2 years she has NO idea I'm a christan      thats what i think that people that really do want help and beg for attention are over shadowed by people mainly attention whores and teen age girls who say everyday they will kill themselves 

so if you really want help people just think your attention seeking      online i don't give a fucking shit about my punctuation or my grammar 

this is not school and i don't have to be perfect online      GOOD 

my mother hates when people renovate the house or buys expensive clothing because there are people in the world that need the money 

yes she's right but in the end its your money and you can do what you want with it     i think that if your going to commit suicide your going to do it 

and I'm not going to stop you because i think its unethical 

ps if you keep saying oh I'm going to kill myself and you never do fuck off     why do you think this?     i think people get offend WAY to easy      i think its like that I'm preparing myself for when the doctor tells me at some point in my life.     no actually the only person in my family that ever had cancer was my dad when he was 9 he had cancer in his shoulder thats it.

every woman in my family lived past there mid 90's      i couldn't find it   I have come to terms with having cancer but i don't have cancer  im so convinced that i have cancer and I'm going to die of it. To the point where i have come to terms with the fact that i will die of cancer.

I have not and have never been diagnoses with cancer 

i feel like a horrible person for it 

but i don't know what to do about it   TITP Mod pictures  [removed]     i LOVE being married 

but i hate hate hate living with someone i much rather live alone     i really don't either       thing is she was with a man in her teens but she says it doesn't  count because he was also gay      i hope the coverage of this story makes them change there minds.     is that slender mans cousin bent man?     i 100% agree its just a selfie that will be deleted at some point its just stupid but who am i to tell them what to do.     we need to protect children from FA and HAES people they are slowly killing there children and these kids cant stop them.     so what losing 5 pounds makes you think OMG i could lose 6 NO thats way to far i don't want to relapse in my anorexia  Doesn't believe I'm a lesbian  My partner who i am married too for the past year and been together for 2 still doesn't believe i am a lesbian like seriously.
She states i cant be a lesbian because she never got the vibe off of me and she is very good at picking out who is gay and who isn't. 
Her second reason is that before i came out when i was 16 i dated men 
and had sex with men then i started dating woman and have ever since.
also says that if we get devorced i will go back to dating guys ( I won't)

so to summarize i am not a lesbian because i dated guys when i was a teen before i came out even thou i am married to a woman and have been dating girls since i was 16.

WTF like fkjfdupifnwipfbreupigne     I think farting is nasty so yes get back at him      Just because he's a butcher doesn't mean that he won't support you being a vegetarian      if its your ONLY one then treat it like it is your only one.
Think about kids who only have 1 doll do they trash it 
NO they treat it like its the most amazing thing in the world and take care of it.     how dare you think that i would find a fat man attractive. 

how dare you not find MY fat attractive you shallow whore.     just made my day:)   TITP contradictions  what TITP contradictions can you think of my fave is * everyone should love there bodies, everyone is worth something* 20 Minutes later....... * your thin you know nothing about oppression you should cover you body its ugly and makes me feel bad*
you cant have it both ways
oh also: they post a selfie and people think they are amazing a thin person posts a selfie they are bullied and shamed till they take it down.     yes always challenge them      why is it bad to want a perfect genetic specimen i am trying to have a baby and i am getting donated sperm i want the sperm i buy to be the top of the top i don't want some fat man with below average intelligence with health problems.
and thats just how it works      send this pic to them they might give you free shit 

     thats just what i was thinking.     WHERE IS THE WARNING assface     someone tell me??     those arnt boobs that is fat rolls.     i have seen it like 15 times     I do NOT think it should be legal at all and i am being told I'm an moron and that i don't understand. But what i do understand is that smoking pot is just like smoking cigarettes and almost all pot is laced i hope it never becomes legal.
also i don't care what you say pot DOES lead to harder drugs because eventually weed doesn't work anymore      Name : Cotie
Reddit age : this account only about a month BUT old account was about 3 years 
Why I want to MOD : because i want to give something back to my have site and they are really funny 
 How much can I be Active (include your GMT): I can be active about 15 hours a day every day ( EST ) time zone
 How fluent I am with css: Not really      Mind if i ask what CSS Mod is      i was going to say something educational but fuck it 

your retarded      really everything is ok until its not ok 
sounds weird but its ok.
i think people are hard wired to stress out more then is really necessary you WILL be ok and in a few weeks you will think "" i stress out WAY to much"".
have a great holiday and remember every time there was hard ship your still OK.     I'm really sorry 
i have gone through this and i know that nothing i say will make you feel better 
i bet you don't want to hear ""if its meant to be then it will be"" or ""you will find someone better"" because that really doesn't help at all 
but with time you do feel better i promise. 

i cant make you feel better but i can let you know that your not alone and there are people to help you.      i know this might not help but what friends family does is pushes christmas back a few days and goes to the sales.
they just say that a family member is sick and they don't feel right opening presents on a sad day.
and really anything is good to kids go to the dollar store and buy a bunch of little things then she has LOTS for a little bit of money 

I'm sure your friend and the baby shower can survive with out a gift just this one time.

Bills are just bills as long as you have a roof over your head and food to eat i think you will be ok      I completely agree HAES and FA are just the same as PRO-ANA they are promoting that people not listen to doctors and basically kill them selves 
FA AND HAES are telling people to listen to them and not there doctors who are trying to save there lives 
i do believe that even with freedom of speech they should be banned from tumblr just like pro anas are      i know its corny but have you tried like an adult friend finder      i don't have a single friend not since i was 15. When i was younger i had 1 or 2 friends but nothing else 
i am now 20 and i haven't talked to anyone that wasn't my family or my partner in years. Other then the friendly hello goodbye on the street , casher at the store or the doctor never more then a few words.

I LOVE it  i never felt the need to have other people in my life 
why don't you just try to not talk to anyone just sit with your self and your own thought. Or you can join an online forum or gaming community and try to get people with the same interest if all else fails go to a bar and get trashed you never know what can happen.     i get this to i wanted some crappy old made for tv movie for my partner and it was like $3000.00 . i think theres a glitch somewhere     ""He knows when your awake........""     Pooh Bear needs to get over robin and pull his life together.     Thank god I'm allergic to bananas and I'm a lesbian see how that worked out      beat me to it      is there a health department there?     did you taste them? Do they taste good?     because all those starving people in africa are so fucking fat.     wtf my sister is fairly thin and she is having a high risk pregnancy because last  pregnancy she had preaclampsia and a very large baby      YOUTUBE is not a doctor stop getting your info from there      at least some people are taking action TITP is just as bad as people who promote anorexia      anorexia can only be diagnosed when the person has a bmi under 18.0 but anorexics start out average size NOT fat your right      im a lesbian and i can tell you i don't think its just men because my partner is very manly and she does this. It pisses me off to no end i think it has something to do with being around other males growing up for my partner it was a lot of male friends that made this behaviour. I can tell you from my point of view woman love men that will show emotions we don't want robots my partner won't even hug me because it makes her feel weak. 
just try to cry by your self at first see how it feels i like people with emotions.     really your were offend by a fucking puppet 

in other news TITP was offend by a sock that mimicked her body shape in a shaming fashion.      and now for the rest of your life everytime you open Facebook there are going to be 10000+ pictures of her kid     she also thinks I'm a lower class citizen because i don't have kids 

BTW i am only in my very early 20s so its not like I'm even that old      how is she suddenly more importuned then anyone else because she knows how to have irresponsible sex     thank you i do work really hard to stay thin. definitely have better partner 
i feel so much better      my mother has 3 children I'm the oldest and i don't think she ever wanted kids 
     Thank you   She's a know it all  (Was in offmychest but told it would fit better here)

my life goal for as long as i remember was to be a mom but since my 18 year old sister had her son 4 months ago i think i have changed my mind. She seems to think that because she's a parent she knows everything about everything i am in the middle of getting my masters and she didn't finish 10th grade but because i haven't squeezed a baby out I'm now a complete idiot. It can only get worse because she's 3 months pregnant AGAIN oh yes she has a 4 month old and is 3 months pregnant. so i never want to be like that.  Not wanting kids  my life goal for as long as i remember was to be a mom but since my 18 year old sister had her son 4 months ago i think i have changed my mind. She seems to think that because she's a parent she knows everything about everything i am in the middle of getting my masters and she didn't finish 10th grade but because i haven't squeezed a baby out I'm now a complete idiot. It can only get worse because she's 3 months pregnant AGAIN oh yes she has a 4 month old and is 3 months pregnant.
so i never want to be like that.     I actually think shame works and i am a fat shammer ( down vote me why don't you) i do it everyday i don't see anything wrong with it.
i mean smokers are shamed and they don't get all up in your face most of the time they usually just move away. 
i have every right to say what and they cant stop me.      get the fuck over your self.     when are tax dollars have to pay for new furniture its getting ridiculous.
      there doctors not miracle workers.     i don't even have a witty comment.
this is just sad.     watch all the fatties try it out.

then break your truck.     the infection i see happening there makes my skin crawl      how does that even happen?     thats one ghetto clue.     Holy SHIT 
no way  I never forgive  i don't think i have ever forgiven a person ever.  My family has no problem just forgiving whoever whenever. I on the other hand cannot 
once someone has wronged me i will NEVER ever forgive them 
friends family no one. My family gets so mad at me about it because i cant get past it but i think people forgive to easily history always repeat its self.
i don't think i want to get past it i am much happier this way.     and WE body shame ok then.     why don't you just fucking lose weight and stop complaining like its just that easy.      Gag!!!     i know a few sets of twins and 2 out of 3 of them still live with there twin in there late 20's and have no SO 
also this is the first thing that comes up for a study http://suite101.com/a/only-child-same-as-peers-only-smarter-a63367
do you need more.  Only Child  [removed]     The smells... that have been smelled  Farting  I think farting is REPULSIVE like its really nasty. Before you say we all fart its not big deal i very rarely ever fart and to prove that i have gone to extreme lengths about 2 years ago i video taped myself at night to make sure i didn't.

but really why cant people go to the bathroom to fart i just think its rude to fart around people like ever.

everyone in my family will run around and fart in peoples faces and think its great i just get grossed out about it.     when you put things on the internet you take the risk of people saying things you don't like . its like they have never been on the internet before. 
the internet is a public place were we can say and think what ever we want so ha.     oh sadly it is and thats not even as big as i have seen them.     where did you get this picture? some context would be nice.     your hand looks like what i think raj from big bang theory's hands would look like      Don't kill it 
I want it :)     Where was this found!!!!!! OMG      Can someone post a link i cant find it.     i would NEVER see a fat nutritionist or dietitian.
I am a registered nutritionist and to be completely honest people who work in my office have been fired for being fat because they don't want a bad reputation. They have had complaints about the advice that has come from fat ""cow workers"".     they have every right to take the child. 
morbid obesity on a child is neglect .     why would you show people that hahaha.     Walmart people are terrifying.     i laughed for like 5 minutes 
people were staring it was awkward.     your not dirty and you shouldn't feel ashamed 
i know your scared 
my sister is 18 and has 2 kids NO not twins so yes i understand scared  
you can do something amazing and give that child up for adoption. you can change someones life 

but ultimately its your choice what you do. once you accept that your pregnant it will be life changing you will relax and calm down and most likely happy      they make me sick i have seen documentaries on it and there main goal is to be immobile and to me thats just disgusting. There partner will have to care for them and thats the ultimate form of control.
OH and because they cant work anymore our tax dollars are whats paying for her tv,food, internet and medical care  and frankly i don't think i should have to pay for people to do this to themselves.     how is this any worse then BBW? they are both unhealthy      you look like a giant penis     I cant 
I cant 
I cant 
handle them anymore      no she's fat but she's wearing a corset 
so she gives the fake curvy look      thats just nasty......      my sister is doing all these things but i believe so different from her 
i think its crazy not to vaccinate i mean even if it causes autism (i don't think it does) its that or death really 

Co-sleeping i proven to increase SIDS 5X more 

so much more it pisses me off      i have hearing aids and have been asked about an implant i said no I'm 20 years old. But deaf people have there own schools ,there own language everything. Sadly like saying black people could just not be black they have there own culture why should we change it. So what i am saying is that children should not get the implant until they are old enough to make these choices for themselves.       if i ever have children it will be ONE  ( older child and adopted)no more then that because its the ability to be a mom but also be not overwhelmed with whining children.     you are preaching to the choir i know exactly how you feel but really theres nothing that can be done. I would really suggest getting some counselling. Offer her to come to if she says no then you don't need that negativity in your life. It will only hinder your recovery.     i have 2 other siblings and i am the oldest i would 100% choose to be an only child not that i don't love my siblings. I feel i was meant to be an only child i am very selfish and quite a loner. I don't like(actually i really hate her) my sister who is close in age. I expect to have all the attention( yes i am bitchy i know) so for me i am a strong believer in only children     fat people are fucking disgusting.     beat me to it     ER or doctors now.     i think thats a miscarriage memorial ornament but still scary as fuck.     Thats not safe for life      you could give it to a school they love stuff like that      so glad i am allergic to bananas.     did you taste it?     i must look this up i have the same issues as you so many ear problems but i lived with 2 chain smokers for my whole life always right next to me.     mind if i ask how you go could go deaf from smoking      no i cant stand her yes yes 3 months pregnant and has a 4 month old didn't finish 10th grade and is 18 so you know. But she does take good care of him thats really the only good thing.     exams YE",1
subject6210,"    Yeah, I think an intro thread would be a great idea!     I wouldn't recommend weighing yourself multiple times a day. It becomes obsessive and it won't be your true weight.     Don't be envious! I still have a ways to go. You'll get there soon too!     [This](http://imgur.com/a/ZQ8L5) is me today. I took a lot of pictures because I was feeling vain. I wish I could get rid of the pouch of fat on my stomach and get my thighs thinner.     I started having little leaks too!

     Welcome! This is a great place for advice and support. Hope we can help you get to your goals     Oh god, there are calories in vape liquid? I was planning on buying some liquid today to go back to vaping since I started smoking again, but this is scaring me!     She is gorgeous!      - binge food - pizza pops, I would restrict all day, then get home and binge on pizza pops

- Purge food - the first time I purged was after I had eaten a huge bowl of lucky charms cereal 

- Body dismorphic moment - I don't remember exactly when, but it was when I hit puberty and started to get hips

- First body part I wanted to change was my thighs and my hips. I'm bottom heavy, so my hips, thighs and ass are big compared to my upper body 

- first succeed in losing weight - I would lose a bit of weight when I was restricting, but my first major weight loss was when I became bulimic when I was 16, I would purge every single thing that went into my body 

- my first goal weight was 84lbs (still is), I never hit it, but I'm hoping I will soon 

- I knew immediately that I was developing an eating disorder 

- I never had a never eat it food until very recently, now I won't eat anything that isn't part of my meal plan.

- I never had a specific person as a thinsperation, it was mostly pictures of girls that I found on pro-ana blogs

- people have always found me to be too skinny, I have been underweight my whole life. I remember my friends telling me that they could snap me like a twig when I was 6 years old.

- my first mantra was a moment on lips forever on the hips and nothing tastes as good as skinny feels     I have been having really bad anxiety about school and finals these days. I've never had anxiety before and I've never really been super stressed about exams, but these days I'm just so stressed and anxious about it. Plus the depression makes it very hard to concentrate and study, which stresses me even more! I almost had a panic attack the other which I have never had before.      This is how I feel too. I really hope this kills me, and soon     Breakfast: Oatmeal with 1tbsp of light peanut butter (180)

So I weighed myself today after not knowing (and estimating) my weight for months and I found out that I'm 4 lbs lighter than I thought! I'm at 92 lbs now.     Thank you!      is my main account, I accidentally posted my stats under that account... I thought I had deleted the comment     What is your daily calorie intake goal?
edit: I  just noticed that you said under 900..     I don't have many goals. But my plan is to stay under 400 calories a day, every day. I'm allowing myself to eat (and hopefully enjoy) at Christmas, it's going to be my cheat day. Then go back to my meal plan after Christmas. 

Also to study and do well on my finals.      You want to eat something with protein for longer lasting energy, or complex carbohydrates.     Usually having a binge will kick start your metabolism when you hit a plateau, so it might actually help you lose weight in the long run!      Yeah, I am in the exact same situation!! It would help me study so much, I am the worst studier ever     Breakfast: Oatmeal with brown sugar and cinnamon (147)

     I wish I could get some adderall to help me study (and restrict)     Well, for me, when I eat something that isn't planned, even just a bite, I go on a full binge and I can't stop eating and I end up eating thousands of cals.      I eat pretty much the same thing every day. So if it's anything that isn't part of my meal plan then I consider it a binge.     Lucky, brain zaps really suck. I had them on other SSRIs, but its been so much worse with effexor     Breakfast: Oatmeal with brown sugar and cinnamon (147)

Total: 361 calories     I would say to only weigh yourself once a day. Your weight fluctuates throughout the day. So the best time to weigh yourself is first thing in the morning after peeing, but before eating. This will give you your most accurate weight. Any other time you are also weighing your food and water, that's why you go up throughout the day     I was on tumblr for a while, but it got pretty lonely because I didn't really have anyone to talk to. But I just discovered this subreddit and it's so nice to be able to interact with people!  Finally reached a long time goal!  This week I reached a goal that I have had for a really long time. I'm finally able to wrap my hands around the top of thighs and have my fingers touch.

Hopefully I will be able to wrap my hand around my upper arm soon. Only a little bit of space until my finger and thumb touches.

Also, after months of not knowing my weight, I will have access to scale on Wednesday and I'll finally know my weight. So I'm excited and nervous     * Height: 5'8

* CW: 96lbs

* HW: 115lbs

* LW: 84 lbs

* GW: 90 lbs

* UGW: 85 lbs

* WL: 8 lbs

* BMI: 14.44

* Age: 19

* Gender expression: Female     Where do you get the white chocolate peppermint tea? That sounds delicious! I'm a sucker for both peppermint and white chocolate     I started effexor a few weeks ago. And it does really suppress my appetite, I've been able to restrict so much better now that I'm on it.

Random question, when you started it, did you get really bad brain zaps? Mine were horrible and I'm still getting some mild ones 3 weeks later. So I'm thinking that my restriction might be making those side effects much more intense.       I wish I could bake and not eat it. But I would go on a total binge if I made food like that.     Weird... well if you want to chat my username is labellemort. And if I get more people I'll start a group     I tried looking for it, but I couldn't find it for some reason     400 cals isn't a lot! That's less then what most consider a meal. You should just go back to your routine tomorrow and it will make up for this. This is just a tiny little blip in the grand scheme of things. One bad day won't make you gain weight, just like 1 good day won't make you lose weight. I don't know much about EC stacks, so I can't say anything about that. But laxatives won't make you lose any real weight, it will just dehydrate you and you might get addicted to them, which would really suck!     Really? There's a group? 
If I get enough interest I'll start another one.
If you want to add me you can!  Hi, I'm new here! Anyone want to chat on kik?  [removed]     Breakfast: Oatmeal with 1tbsp of brown sugar and 1/2 tsp cinnamon (147)

Total: 347 cals     Apparently the bmi that people find the most attractive is 19, which is a bit above underweight. I think most people find slightly underweight girls attractive but once you get too low people stop finding it attractive. 

Probably a big part of why people find underweight girls attractive is because of the media and advertising, most actresses and models are underweight or very near it.
     I love the food network!!! You gotta here is my favourite show! I'll have to check out Simply Sara. I also really like going to look at food in stores or at the cafeteria at my uni  DAE love looking at food porn?  I love looking at pictures of food, reading recipes and reading menus. I spend hours looking at pictures of food and reading recipes.

Ignore my stomach I'm pretty bloated :'(      Yeah, I've been in therapy and on meds for a long time, but depression will most likely be a life long problem for me.     Yeah, I've been in therapy for over 5 years and tried a bunch of different meds, but nothing really helps     I've been trying to treat my depression for over 5 years now, meds, therapy, all that fun stuff. But it will most likely be a life long problem for me. I really hate mental illness  I think I'm relapsing  Hello,
I think I'm relapsing back into my anorexia after going into treatment in February. I've started missing meals and snacks this week and the meals I do eat are much smaller than they should be. 

I thought that I would be happier being healthy, but I'm not, I'm still miserable and depressed. 

I just can't decide if I should keep trying to eat healthy and push down the urges or if I should just let myself slip back into my anorexia. I hate this, I just want to die and leave a pretty, skinny corpse. 

Ignore my stats, those were before going into treatment. I have no idea what I weigh now, but I'm above 130lbs  I don't know if I can recover...  8 weeks ago I went into inpatient treatment and I started group therapy 5 weeks ago. But I don't know if I can recover. I'm eating everything I should be, everyone says that I'm doing great. But I feel horrible, my depression is really bad, I'm selfharming and I've gotten so big. I'm the biggest I've ever been in my life. My suicidal thoughts are through the roof, and starving myself is the only way I'm brave enough to kill myself. I was so close to being perfect and dead.

I don't know if I can do this anymore, but everyone would be so disappointed with me if I stopped. I just don't know what to do anymore.     Put a heating pad on your stomach, it helps with the bloating and pain     I'm in a treatment program right now, but I'm debating if I should stay. I know I should at least give it a try, but the ed voice won't shut up     I haven't really lefted. I just stopped posting because I'm trying to recover, but I'm checking the sub everyday     Drink warm water, cold water makes you feel hungrier     Thanks, it's been really rough. I miss you guys but I feel like I shouldn't participate because I'm trying to recover     Yeah, I am, but I still check the sub everyday     We know it isn't healthy. But it's for people who aren't ready to recover and need a place to vent or talk about the struggles of this illness with people who won't force them to recover and who will understand     It's a super accepting community! Everyone is welcome there     /r/proed has one  inpatient update: one week  I've been in inpatient for a week now. I thought I'd post an update because I'm super bored and having a really rough day.

I've been feeling really depressed since I've been here, but especially today. My selfharm and suicidal thoughts are through the roof and the ed voice won't fucking shut up. 

Most meals have been ok, typical hospital food. But I had a breakdown over a sandwich the other day. I just started bawling my eyes out because I hate sandwiches, especially egg salad. 

Today was med review, I got 2 15 minute passes a day to go smoke which is awesome. But they also said that my bmi is almost 16, that puts me at around 100lbs. I feel so fucking fat. All I hear in my head is how fat, disgusting and a failure I am. I've gained faster than they thought I would, so I'll probably start group therapy on Monday. 

I just want to lose this weight. I feel disgusting and horrible and fat. I hate myself, but I know I should try recovery, but I just want to go home and starve myself. 

I'm on a general psychiatric unit. Most people here are nice. There's this one guy who is such an asshole, everyone hates him! 

Sorry, this turned into a really long post, I just feel so lonely

Edit: And my roommate is so thin. She is so triggering.      I just had my first night in ip. It's really strange here, but everyone seems really nice. I'm definitely the fattest one here though, which is really upsetting. Plus I can't go for cigarettes for a while and that is really stressing me out. My first meal is in a few minutes and I'm really scared  Thank you and goodbye  I finally got the call to go into inpatient treatment. I have to be at the hospital in an hour and a half. I'm anxious, scared but excited. This is a new chapter in my life, but I hope it all works out.

I just wanted to thank all of you lovely people. You have all be so nice and supportive through this incredibly rough part of my life. I'm so glad that I found you guys, but it's my time to leave. 

I really hope that each and every one of you reach your UGWs and find your happiness. You all deserve it. You are all beautiful people, inside and out! 

Thank you and goodbye!

Edit: oh god, I'm the fattest one here :(     Purging is a really horrible habit to get into, it's super addictive and harmful. It usually leads to weight gain because you think you can have bigger binges, but you still end up only purging 50% of your cals and you absorb so much more because of your now bigger binges. But if you really want, you can pm me     I have a friend who told a bunch of people at school, the school counselor and my mom when I was 14. But my mom denies that she was told, so I don't know if she actually told my mom. But she definitely told people at school  Suggestion for a weekly thread  I thought that a weekly (or monthly) thread for health/harm-reduction/beauty tips would be good. What we do really takes a toll on our bodies and if we had a thread where people could ask advice on harm reduction and beauty tips could be really helpful. That way we can help each other stay as healthy and beautiful as possible.

I know I've had problems with some things but I didn't want to start a new thread for it     I have 3 rabbits, a cat, an elephant and a sloth. Plus I bought them as gifts for so many people. They are so soft and such good quality     I always make sure to plan my binges so the flavours will go together when I purge, so I usually end up with a sweet binge and a savoury binge     Omg, that's a jellycat stuffed rabbit! I have so many of those stuffed animals. They sold them at my old job so I would always buy some when we got a new shipment     FYI, you can still get pregnant if you don't have your period     No, but I take sleeping pills every night     I have ""recovered"" and relapsed so many times I can't even count anymore     I definitely flushed about 40$ worth of food down the toilet in the last 24 hours. I can't afford to throw all my money away. Thanks, good luck to you too     I saw that, I had no advice to give you. Binging and purging is an unhealthy, disgusting and wasteful habit, but so addictive.   My plan to stop binging and purging  I've been binging and purging way too much lately, I have gained  lbs in 2 months and I feel absolutely disgusting. Seeing that number made me want to throw up. So I've made a plan to stop. I'm posting this here for accountability. I feel like I've made so many of these posts though, but here we go again.

I b/p'ed multiple times today. I had a big dinner which I didn't purge, I feel pretty guilty about that, but I need to stop purging.

I will eat around 800 calories for the next few days. Then on saturday I'm having lunch with my mom for her birthday, I will order a BLT. Then starting on sunday I will restrict to 600 calories for a few days. After that I will return to my usual 400 calories a day.

I also plan to read a chapter of my book or work on my jigsaw puzzle every time I have an urge to binge.

I really hope this works because I don't think I can handle to go down this road again. B/p really takes a toll on my mental and physical health.     Oh god no, my life is hell. I've been doing the same thing everyday for almost 2 months now. I miss my old life. I'm reading the Harry Potter books, but I'm not getting much reading done because my concentration is shit     I wake up at around 9 am. Go for a cigarette, then I have breakfast and check social media. I watch some tv, have more cigarettes. I have lunch and watch more tv. Then in the afternoon I either watch tv, knit, work on a jigsaw puzzle or read. Have more cigarettes and some diet coke. Then my mom comes home from work and we have dinner. After we walk our dog. We watch some tv or a movie together. Then it's bed time, I get ready for bed at around 10:30. 

Some days I have doctors appointments.

My life is incredibly boring     Companies can say something is 0 cals if it has less than 5 calories per serving     I don't have any experience with this, but I have a few trans friends. When you go on HRT it's like going through puberty again, and that takes a lot of energy! So it would make sense that it would make you hungrier.

I hope you all the best in your transition! Congrats     I know how you feel, I spend my days moping around the house, which leads to binging and purging. I have no motivation to do anything but watch tv and b/p. It really sucks     If you are weighing yourself multiple times a day, then it will fluctuate because of food or water weight. It's best to only weigh yourself once a day, at the same time     I absolutely love fldebolle, but it's not available where I live. I would probably get so fat if I had access to them everyday.     Breakfast: Chocolate chia pudding (143)

Lunch: Egg whites (60), celery (6), red bell pepper (11) and cucumber (8)

Dinner: Shirataki noodles with vegetable bouillon and soya sauce (26)

Snacks: Vanilla greek yogurt (140), sugar free lemon jello (20), diet coke (0) and mia sport (0)

Total: 414 calories

I left my house for other than cigarettes, food or doctors appointment for the first time in months. I was out of the house 5 and half hours. I am completely drained, I have absolutely no energy left. I really want to eat a jar of peanut butter right now. But I don't have any.     I could definitely go for a jar of peanut butter right now, thank god I don't have any or else it would turn into a crazy binge     Plus you don't even lose weight, most of the time you gain     I like to stay under 500 calories     Definitely binging and purging. It fucks your teeth, electrolytes and organs wayyyyy more than restricting     I haven't binged and purged in 2 days. I'm hoping that I'm back in the restricting groove     This is my biggest fear! I'm also terrified that they will give me regular coke instead of diet     Breakfast: Oatmeal with brown sugar and cocoa (147)

Lunch: Egg whites (60), celery (6), red bell pepper (11) and cucumber (8)

Dinner: Shirataki noodles with vegetable bouillon and soya sauce (26)

Snacks: Sugar free lemon jello (20), chia pudding (142), diet coke (0), diet 7up (0) and mio spor (0)

Total: 421 calories     I like to drink diet soda or vitamin water zero. It's also good to have a bunch of low cal snacks ready, that way you can eat a bunch but not go over your calorie goals. You can save your meals for after you've smoked. 

For me I just avoid eating anything or else the floodgates open and I eat everything, but if I don't eat then I'm fine. Plus eating shortens the high     That is amazing! You definitely deserve to be happy and to celebrate     Breakfast: Oatmeal with brown sugar and cocoa (147)

I have a bad cold right now, so I'm having lots of soup and diet 7up. I'm hoping this will help me get back into the restriction groove. 

I still have a bit of leftover birthday cake, I've been pretty good at resisting the urges to b/p it, hopefully I will keep staying strong. My mom also said that she will stop buying peanut butter because she knows I will b/p a whole jar in a day.

I need to get back into my groove     I think it can raise your BMR at least 200 calories, probably more     I love sweet potatoes, but without a food scale I can't know the calorie count, so I just avoid them. I wish I could have some     Your metabolism speeds up when you are on your period     If it's non-perishable you could bring it to your local food bank     Not when I'm restricting. But I've been wasting so much money on food so I can binge and purge. Spent over 30$ on food yesterday and it all ended up in the toilet     The closer I get to going into treatment, the more I freak out about weight gain. They want me to have a bmi of at least 20, but I have never been in the healthy bmi range in my life. It terrifies me that I will have to get in that range. Plus it will make me the fatest in my family. 

I also have no motivation to do anything anymore. I have books, Lego sets, knitting, but all I want to do is watch shitty tv. I don't even have the motivation to start a tv series on Netflix or watch a movie. It just takes so much     Sometimes a higher intake helps a plateau. It might boost your metabolism and kickstart your weight loss. 

I wish I had advice to give you, but I'm in a very similar boat right now     I don't understand why they lock those dumpsters. It's not like they are using that food anyways. Sometimes clothing stores throw away old clothing and they will cut it up so people can't wear. Why don't people want to help those that have barely anything?     And the app makes it really easy to switch between different accounts if you have more than 1      I'm pretty sure vodka is the lowest cal alcohol. So you can just get that with your favourite low-cal drink!     Everything came back normal, so I didn't have to get hospitalized. I just wasted all day in the ER     Everything is normal now and I'm getting sent home after I have an EKG.      It was 78/64 with a heart rate of 120bpm. I don't feel dehydrated. I drink lots of water  Urg, I hate the hospital  I went to the doctor's this morning for my weekly check up/weigh in (lost 3lbs!!). And my blood pressure was incredibly low and my heart rate was really high. He told me and my parents to go to the emergency room to get IV fluids and that I might have to stay overnight. I've been sitting in the ER for 5 hours already, I still haven't seen a doctor or gotten my IV fluids. I really want a cigarette, but they won't let me leave. Urg, I don't need this right now, I have finals to study for.

Edit: I did not get hospitalized, I just wasted all day in the ER. My heart went back to normal and all of my blood work is perfect.      I am super stressed out because I should be studying for finals, but instead I have to spend the afternoon in the ER because my blood pressure is really low and my heart rate is really high. I might have to stay overnight and defer my exam in the morning. Urg, I really want a cigarette, but I can't leave     This is awesome! I like the quotes ""The girl of my nightmares, sultry and corpse-like"" and ""Diet coke and cigarettes is what skinny girls are made of""     I have IBS, I take probiotics to help the symptoms and it works for me. 

What most people with IBS try is the low FODMAP diet and a lot of people say it helps. I personally never tried it though     Breakfast: Oatmeal with brown sugar and cinnamon (147)

     We were just both in such bad places mentally, we both started manipulating each other and talking shit about the other. But we actually reconciled a few years later     It's nice to have someone to talk to, but it usually gets pretty competitive when you do it with friends. It kind of ruined one of my friendships      Haha, I am always in my giant bathrobe wrapped in a blanket!     I have a few ""friends"" at university, but they're just my lab partners and once the class is done we probably won't ever talk again. 

I'd love to have an ED meetup, but I doubt anyone on here lives near me. It's nice to have irl friends who know what you're going through. I had a few friends in high school who had EDs too, but they all recovered     It's alright, but it's probably the most boring part of Canada, and our winters are usually horrible (not this year though, thank god!)     Nope :(
I'd love to kik though, add me my username is labellemort!     I hate clubs, the only time I can stand them is if I do M, but because of anti-depressants I don't get high from it. 

Haha, I've been joking that I'm an 80 year old man in a 19 year old girls body (idk why I am an old man though)     I totally understand what you mean. It's a lonely disease, and it does force you to isolate yourself. Thankfully I have 2 people to talk to about it     Yeah, we are far from each other. I'm right in the middle. I wish I was put west, it's much nicer     Yeah, I have a dog and she's great! I wish I could have a cat though     I am so excited to get weed. I try to only smoke it when I'm on holidays and I'm on holidays in less than 2 weeks. I can't wait to get high and not feel horrible     I am from Canada! But it's so big we are probably far from each other     She'll grow out if it! She's just a kitten.
It's always nice to have an excuse to get out     It's not real weight. It's from the food and drinks you had today     I wish I had a cat, I love them, but my mom is super allergic. I wish I had friends who invited me out.     Yeah, my mom is great! But sometimes you just need a friend who isn't your mom.      Haha, pretty much every Saturday night is me alone in my bed on reddit. It really sucks.     Yeah, I am super introverted and the ed doesn't help. All of my friends from school are hardcore partiers and go to raves, so when high school ended, I had nothing in common with them anymore and we just stopped talking. I wish I had someone who just wants to hang out and talk or watch movies  The loneliness is killing me  I've been so lonely these days. I have no friends, the only person I ever really talk to is my mom. I just wish I had someone to talk to, that's probably why I post so much on this sub, haha. 
I don't know how to get over the loneliness. I just want friends     The same as everyday. I'm such a creature of habit

     I used to have a thinspo journal. I think I know where it is, I should pull it out     Hey fellow lesbian! It's nice to see that there are other LGBT* people here     Welcome to the sub! Glad to have you hear and hope we can help     Yeah, I've noticed that all I see is fat when I binge. But thankfully I've only binge twice in the past month  People making comments about your body  Urg, my dad just told me that I need to put some meat on my bones. He knows about my eating disorder. I just snapped at him and told him he was never allowed to make comments about my body or what I eat. Urg, he just pissed me off soo much.     Thanks! You'll get there! I believe in you     Thank you!!     I only really compare my body to really thin girls.      That's how it is for most people with eating disorders and I was like that too     Hi!

  Eating disorder without dismorphia  Usually people who have eating disorders have body dismorphia and see themselves as larger than they really are. I used to be really dismorphic, but not this time. I can see that I'm thin, I probably don't see myself as thin as other people see me, but I still see someone who is thin. But I want to get even thinner, pretty much a skeleton. Is anyone else like this?     Thanks!     You can do it! I believe in you     Thanks! I've been liking my hip bones a lot lately     I kind of hope that my eating disorder kills me, but I doubt it will, especially since I'm getting monitored weekly by my doctor     I love /r/fatlogic. Such a great sub     I have 2 accounts. My main one and this one      I know how you feel. I've been binging after being binge free for almost a month. 

It's just 1 set back, you didn't ruin all of your work. Any weight you gain isn't real weight, just food and water weight.

Don't beat yourself up too much     Hey there!
I'm subject6210! I've been struggling with disordered eating on and off for about abut 7 years now. I'm currently in my worst relapse ever. I used to really struggle with purging but this time I mostly stick to restricting. I've been restricting to under 400 cals for over 2 months now. 

I'm mostly likely going into recovery sometime in the new year. I'm excited and nervous. I want to stop living like this, but I have to reach my GW before I get admitted to the program. 

I'm 19, I'm a university student studying biology. I want to be a doctor. My life is pretty boring, it's mostly been swallowed up by my eating disorder.      I wasn't restricting, I was mostly recovered ba",1
subject6446,"    I dont mean to sound so rude. I guess I just needed to get some stuff out sorry about that lol     Thank you for the advice yes I suspect depression. I tryed therapy about a year ago and was diagnosed with anorexia and bipolar type 2, but she really didn't help me. looking back on it I think it made things worse, the therapist I saw kind of ignored the issues that I was actually ready to deal with, and as soon as I came in she said she thought I was bipolar. The psychiatrist she sent me too was her friend from highschool, or something, and she immediately perscibed me medication for bipolar disorder type 2, without even talking to me. The whole thing made me feel like my own opinion and self awareness was unimportant.
Wow way more rant-ish than I intended sorry I guess I just want some opinions on all this bull shit.
I wish I was just fucking normal. 
  Help  I dont want to do anything anymore.
Im on vyvance 50mg, I just switched from 40mg to 50mg this month, and it's not like my medication isnt working. I know it is, but I just dont want to do anything, not even things I love to do. I feel empty, and restless. The strange thing is these feelings only happen when the sun sets...literally when it gets dark outside.  
Someone please tell me what the fuck is wrong with me??  Really need some support (rant)  My to do list is so long! I have so many things due at the end of the week, and through out the week, I got locked on to one assignment, and spent all of my time on it I now  have only a few days to do these REALLY important things I put off. I feel so fucking overwhelmed!!!     Also any one struggle with doubting yourself?

I was surprised by the effect the meds have on my appetite when I first took them.  And now I have this nagging part of me that says that I shouldn't be allowed medication, because im just going to use it for weight loss. I'm not trying to use it in this way, and I know that. But when I start having these thoughts, it's hard for me to convince myself otherwise. :/     

Thanks guys! :)

 I will have to try the small meals through out the day thing. I just recently upped my dosage too. So im going to have to try something, because only eating on break days in not helping me maintain for sure. :/ 

So are you diagnosed?  I would just like to hear about how your adhd effects your ED, or vice versa. I haven't met anyone who has both if these problems, and I would love to have someone to relate too about it.       God damn pumpkin spice anything...     My aunt and uncle saw a guy just get up and take all his clothes off ...he got arrested      I would just put it under the seat and spray some perfume if the cops dont have probable cause to search your car you have every right to say no if they ask to seach it then they have to get a warrant and thats too much effort for most of them...been there man.     Keep it Zefff     Cosmo throwing shade man...     Yes the places in my dreams are often connected to other places for example my house and my school and my workplace are often the same huge building...they never look like they do in reality and im never in the situation I'm just wandering through it and also sometimes places are both outdoors and indoors like once I was on a highway but it was a huge tunnel it was almost like a fake highway inside a movie set or something      No problem im just beginning to explore the meanings and stuff behind my dreams and so the thoughts were already rattling around in my head anyway lol
     Im guessing that there is something in your life you dont know how to deal with you need guidance and comfort but you dont know where to find it most dreams are not cut and dry your mother in the dream might be a symbol for help and guidance to you that you are searching for and your father is probably a symbol of a person in your life you feel should be able to help you but cannot/does not this is just a very ambiguous interpretation it might help you think about the dream in a different context     First im really sorry about your mother I cant image what that must be like condolences for your loss and secondly this might be a simplistic view of it but you miss your mom and you are looking for her...when she passed away did you not get to tell her something or did you feel like you didn't get to do something with her that you wanted to? Or are you having something stressful happen in your life that you think she could have helped with?  Sorry for all the questions but it helps with interpretation     I get hurt in dreams and can feel if for days afterwards its usually some disgusting infected wound and I feel itching and burning on the areas where it happened the worst one was my hand was cut at the bottom of my palm near my wrist and it was like a flap I could look into and I could see bone and green and yellow puss around it so fucking nasty I can feel it when I talk about it lol when I woke up I felt like the cut had closed but my hand was still like that on the inside...     Btw sorry if its difficult to read my writing im dyslexic so I get some words confused lol      Nothing to the extent that it was when I was a child. I used to dream of that group of dark things (or a similar one) carrying me above there heads from my bedroom to the sofa in my living room I would wake up right after the dream and actually be on the sofa my mom says I used to sleep walk and I think I just walked to the sofa in my sleep but the dreams where so real and I always woke up where they left me pretty terrifying for a little kid...and It would happen every night so I just started sleeping on the sofa so they couldn't move me    Recovery sub reddit?  [removed]     Dude what the fuck...I feel high lol  Calm  So I finally feel a little calmer but I think its because iv gone for about 30 something hours or so without sleep I actually feel calmer than I have in quite a while     I feel better now it just stopped randomly...il chalk that one up to hormones lol      I thinks mainly because, when I was diagnosed my doctor tested about 4 different medications, in atleast 3 different doses on me, over the course of less than a year. I looked at my medical record and it was actually pretty scary even just reading it. Stuff like not seeming to be myself anymore sleeping constantly and then staying up days at a time and having violent outbursts. I dont remember any of this (I think I have repressed alot of memorys because of things unrelated to this ordeal) So my parents basically watched me get treated like a lab rat. I was really young it probably would not have seemed so scary if I had been older....anyway I think everyone in my family, especially my mom, was pretty traumatised by the whole thing and so they just never talked about it.

My mom always helped me so much that I performed pretty great in school, and so she sort of made up for the lack of medication. I know the whole thing is weird, but I also know that if I had any excuse to fail I would take it and say see look I told you I was a failure!   so I also think she was trying to prevent that too. it actually made me feel good in the end to find out that even with ADHD and dyslexia I made all As. 

I've always felt inadequate and stupid but its all in my head (so they tell me ;) i will use any justification I can to call myself stupid      This is going to sound weird, but I went up until my senior year of highschool not knowing I was dyslexic or that I had ADHD. 
The weird part is my mother knew...I was diagnosed in the 4th grade, and she didn't tell me until after highschool, (sounds bad but there was a good reason). So I just kinda thought I was stupid...      Thank you for all the positive feedback guys      Very cool :)      Definitely rude :) I wasn't implying I was special...but thats obvious now isnt it I hope the stick in your ass finds its way out darling have a nice day! :)  Girl wanting to gain!  [removed]     Thanks :) im actually excited lol so strange   Is there a sub reddit for anorexia recovery?  Need a bit of support im in my first few days of recovery from anorexia and I bet reddit can help me out :)

Thanks guys!      In what context?       I have been getting these sort of exams since I was 14. I have never experienced this or anything even remotely similar, this doctor definitely had no reason to do that. PLEASE tell someone! Im so sorry this happened to you :(      It's log it's log... it's big its heavy its wood... its log it's log it's better than bad it's good!     I've struggled with the same thing :/ but it's not as bad now that I have tattoos :) just a suggestion people atleast tend to recognize I'm 18 or older now lol     Howl - its absolutely gorgeous     I just finished watching escape from tomorrow (look it up :p) so right now I'm going to have to say Disney world.....      It might just be because its a photo of the work, but I dont think his nose looks to long just my 2 cents. :)  Bird over mountains [white and vine charcoal]    Landscape abstraction       The drawing was of a mirror in a box with holes in it reflecting another mirror that was aimed at a window so just kinda ran with the cube/box concept :)      I used charcoal (vine, stick, and powder) and the highlights are white charcoal  Abstract reflections        And then I end up late because I got distracted...     Dont worry people do this, and things like it, all the time. Go to sleep your fine :)     I like to rip paper into the smallest pieces I can....and then throw them. It actually takes alot of effort to not do this with all paper lol      This happens to me often :( my family and I had to drive to DC today, and I fell asleep in the car and I woke up and couldn't move eventually I figured out how to make noise, it was like tiny little whisper screams. my mouth was wide open, and my teeth started to fall out, until my mouth was full of them, overflowing. Then my step dad turned around and looked at me, he was crying...its not usually so dramatic but its always absolutely terrifying :/     Yes so does my dad      You could still have a blank space time fabric without any matter but the universe holds the space time fabric together...so technically no       A homeless man talked to me about the mistakes he made financially and told me how to avoid making those mistakes it was a really cool conversation...but I think the other homeless guy who talked to me about drugs and the  government hacking our brains wins lol     Decided to recover, and start living. It was terrifying to let go of, but it was worth it.  My humble abode       Yup and another yup...     Definitely, its feels dirty to me. I especially hate to eat things that require silverware on the beach.     Yup mine is because of a tick/nervous habit I also pick at my thumbs :/       Being vegan is generally a choice made by an adult....I've never heard of a vegan baby... but im guessing the parents wouldn't consider there own milk an animal product?   R/feminism im high...but is this *ucked up?  Ok so I was a bit high when reading this article  just a warning***

Am I crazy to be disturbed by the multiple mentions of the physical appearance of the doctors and patents involved?  

""A petite woman with a blunt haircut and a round face""

""A state senator sporting pink running shoes""

""She wore a waffle tee that showed off an intricate tattoo on her sternum""

 ""I find her by the clacking of her heels""

""Miller is feisty, with a sharp blond bob""

I'm honestly a bit torn, the article was informative, and the topic incredibly disturbing,  and it seemed that the author was pro choice, but I felt uncomfortable reading about hairstyles, and fashion choices, of these women, in an article about their battle for women's rights. I was confused as to why it would be seen as relevant in any way. The author shouldn't (and probably dosnt?) care about the physical appearance of the doctors, or patients, and the people reading this article shouldn't (in my opinion) care about there physical appearance of them. So why is this information included at all?

I cant tell if im being too picky or radical about this, and I was a bit stoned when I read it, but it was so strange to see random comments about appearance, scattered throughout an article about something so important, and disturbing, that seemed to be written by an author passionate about women's rights. 

So what to you guys think? Am I reading to much into this? Or is there something wrong with it? 

Thanks and sorry if I sound crazy :)     Can't decide if Creepy or awesome....     Cranberry sauce...don't judge me      I can always tell because I get horny as fuck a few days before and really clingy/emotional :/ barf     These are so incredible! I would love to learn how to do this? What kind of glass work is it?      This will sound strange but In my experience the way that it happens is you realize slightly that you are dreaming and the entities in your dream dont want that and then it turns to sleep paralysis because you now know that you are asleep you can try to harness this into lucid dreaming if you can learn to take control of your dream when I was little I would realize I was asleep but I knew that the ppl in my dream couldn't know or they would hurt me and eventually I got up the courage to simply and calming state out loud in my dream that I was asleep and then the world will be yours to take control of idk if it works this way for everyone I think the reson it happens during ur naps is because you are only half asleep   Sorry for wall of text :/     When I was a little kid it used to be a crowd of things (monsters?) Dark figures and they would just hover around me and stare at me and get closer and closer creepy shit lol     I dont really remember it was a few years ago but my grandmother had recently passed away I think it was her or my minds version of her. Most of the time I dont really see a particular person I just hear the door open and I know someone is there but the part that scares me is always that I cant move or if I try to I lift away from my body and thats even worse than not moving      I had a week where every night at 3am I saw a woman in a white nightgown with very pale white skin and white hair and she touched my feet and asked me to help her/come with her she wasnt a bad thing I could tell she wasn't evil she just wanted something but I was still really freaked out....lol     Because hot dogs are pieces of plastic filled with leftover meat and the shapes are from the ends of the plastic tubes being cut off...sorry if I ruined hot dogs...     My family and I had to drive to DC, and I fell asleep in the car and I woke up and couldn't move this happend a few more times and my terror increases I figured out how to make noise, it was like tiny little whisper screams. my mouth was wide open, and my teeth started to fall out, until my mouth was full of them, overflowing. Then my step dad turned around and looked at me a tear ran down his face and I woke up hyperventilating....sleep paralysis fun shit

      I dont mean to sound so rude. I guess I just needed to get some stuff out sorry about that lol      I dont mean to sound so rude. I guess I just needed to get some stuff out sorry about that lol     Thank you for the advice yes I suspect depression. I tryed therapy about a year ago and was diagnosed with anorexia and bipolar type 2, but she really didn't help me. looking back on it I think it made things worse, the therapist I saw kind of ignored the issues that I was actually ready to deal with, and as soon as I came in she said she thought I was bipolar. The psychiatrist she sent me too was her friend from highschool, or something, and she immediately perscibed me medication for bipolar disorder type 2, without even talking to me. The whole thing made me feel like my own opinion and self awareness was unimportant.
Wow way more rant-ish than I intended sorry I guess I just want some opinions on all this bull shit.
I wish I was just fucking normal.

Im on vyvance 50mg, I just switched from 40mg to 50mg this month, and it's not like my medication isnt working. I know it is, but I just dont want to do anything, not even things I love to do.

I was surprised by the effect the meds have on my appetite when I first took them.  And now I have this nagging part of me that says that I shouldn't be allowed medication, because im just going to use it for weight loss. I'm not trying to use it in this way, and I know that.

subject6681,"    I am still bothered from yesterday, when I had to eat supper (and snacks) without knowing any of the calorie content. I don't know why but little things like that bother me. I am going to make up for it by restricting today. Should be easy because I will be at work.

**Breakfast** : Skipped

**Lunch** : 1/2 block of Tofu (315 calories)

**Dinner** :  Skipped

**Snacks** : Skipped

**Total**: 315 Calories     Damn. Hits close to home.      I can relate to this post a lot. I haven't ate anything today and I'm debating between continuing the fast or just throwing away all fucks and eating. I hate myself too, and want to embrace Ana because I feel like it might make me happier, but I don't even know anymore. Ugh.      My goal for August is mainly to maintain weight and to not seem suspicious around friends / parents / therapists. After August, I am moving far away - where no one can tell me what to eat.      Shitty Day. I've been able to avoid food so far. I'm not sure what dinner will bring... I may have to eat so I don't look suspicious. 

EDIT: My prediction was right. I couldn't avoid the food any longer without my parents knowing. I had to eat a larger portion at supper, along with some snacks. I am just going to write today off at 2000 calories and pray to god it doesn't affect my weight that much. We will see what the scale says tomorrow. 

Breakfast : Skipped (0 calories)

Lunch : Skipped (0 calories) 

Dinner : Chili and fries and vegetables (??? calories)

Snacks :  Banana (105), crackers and hummus (???) 

Total: ~2000 Calories     Hello there! It seems this sub doesn't have too many guys on it, from what I can tell. But we're growing in numbers!(:     So far I have walked over 10,000 steps thanks to pokemon GO and hanging out with friends. I plan to walk even farther this evening! 

Breakfast : Skipped

Lunch : Tofu and Spinach (315)

Dinner : Potato and Beans ( 400) 

Snacks : One slice Pizza (260) , Banana (105) 

Total: 1080 Calories      Breakfast: Skipped

Lunch: Oatmeal (360)

Dinner: Vegan Burgers and Fries (820) 

Snacks: Banana (105) 

Total: 1285 Calories

Bonus points- I was able to fast for 20 hours inbetween last night's early supper and lunch today.      -Breakfast: Skipped (0)

-Lunch: Tofu and Veggies (338) 

-Supper: Pita (476 )

-Snack: Orange ( 62)

I know I'm posting this a day late, but not bad.  Longtime Lurker- Intro  Hello everyone,

I've been lurking this subreddit for a long time. Now, Im hoping to join this wonderful community!3 Here is a little bit of backstory ,while still trying to maintain my anonymity : 

- Shitty Go at Life (rather not go into details)

- Mental Health Worsened: Depression + Anorexia (Hence the username) 

- Was recently hospitalized in inpatient for two weeks, at a LW of 104lbs (forced to go by therapist and parents - hated every second)

- Currently in ""recovery"" (lol)

I only have a couple sessions left before I am moving far away. When I move, I plan to break all ties to therapy and embrace the soothing voice of Ana once again. Until then, I can't restrict too much, but I am going to try my best...


I'm looking forward to meeting wonderful people here in this community 3.    Fasting for a month: Update  Well.. I failed. 
But not because of lack of willpower, or anything.

I was in my dorm room, when I felt a little hungry. This was about day 5 of my fast. Naturally, I used water to suppress my hunger. Although I used a little bit *too* much water. I felt extremely light headed and dizzy. I collapsed. When I woke up I was completely covered in my own shit and vomit. My headache was surreal and my eyes were bulging. So I went to ER.

Electrolyte imbalance.

So....I'm dropping out of Uni. My parents want me to come home and ""work on my health"". Not sure if thats going to look like inpatient or outpatient. Fuck this. There is nothing to do in my home town. I won't be able to get back in until Fall 2017. That's almost a whole year now..

I'm 18. No job. Not a student. And moving back in with my parents. 

Kill me.      I wish I could help you man, 

I am currently in a University dorm and things are not going well for me eating disorder wise. I struggle every single day. 

I've declined meals out with people,

I've been throwing up in the bathroom dorms,

I'll probably end up taking some time off to get my shit together and figure what the heck I'm doing with my life.      Another male joins this sub! Welcome!(:      Congrats to the new mods!(:   My Extended Fast: Day 1 Complete  [previous post] (https://www.reddit.com/r/proED/comments/5ae0en/fasting_for_a_month/) 

I enjoyed my last week of October,

I got drunk four times

I got high twice

And I even tripped once. 

Why not have a little fun before I embark on this long spiral downwards? 

Anyways, I completed the first 24 hours easily. I've done 7   10 day fasts before so I don't think it'll be an issue. 

Not sure how often I'll do these posts either.. I'll try *not* to every day because that would spam the subreddit. 

Sorry for the ramble, I don't have anyone else in my life who would listen to me about this.      Ouch... this hits close to home.

I never felt more guilty than when I saw my own mom cry in family therapy when she said - 

**""I spent 18 years raising my child, but now he is starving himself and I don't know what to do""**     Thanks3. I promise I will be checking in on this subreddit throughout the fast.(:      Wow! Amazing talent! 

A few of these remind me of myself... especially the 7th one because of the long hair. 

I could only dream of being that skinny though lmao  Fasting for a month?  I fasted for a week in September,

I then fasted for 10 days in October. 

I spend every waking moment of my life feeling depressed   like my life is spiraling out of control and I HATE it. Years have passed any nothing changes. 

The only way I can suppress this feeling is through fasting now a days. 

I think I'm going to do this. 

If I die, at least I'll be skinny.      Haha yup! On multiple occasions actually. 

I posted about one of my stories [here on this subreddit before] (https://www.reddit.com/r/proED/comments/4vnt3f/i_almost_gave_myself_away/) (:     **Day 9 of Fast**

Alright, it seems like after all this time I am going to have to end my fast now at around 9.5-10 days-ish. The reason being it takes a little while to work your way up to solid foods again after fasting that long and I will be expected to eat food on friday :S. Oh, and alcohol at a party~ 

Not counting calories, because I accidentally screwed up already. whoopssssssssssss  DAE Have Sleep Issues?  Does anybody on this sub have sleep issues?

Usually, I don't have any issues with my sleep. However, when you throw my eating disorder into the mix I find that my sleep issues go through the roof. When I am restricting I sleep wayyy too much because I am constantly tired. When I am fasting (especially for long periods of time) I can't sleep AT ALL. Like right now I am about 8.5 days into my fast and It's currently 1am and I am not tired. A couple days ago I went 36 hours without sleep. This is a problem as it's interfering with my university work. 

thoughts?     **Day 8 of my Fast!!** 

Currently feel horrible, but lets see how far I can push this. I have plans to party friday night so I will probably break the fast thursday afternoon, which will put me at 10 days.

Also, I am now 115 pounds, and a 5'9"" that puts me at a bmi of 17. woo~ 

Breakfast: 0 calories

I know that gaining sucks, and with an eating disorder it can make you feel like the world is ending, but I just thought I would leave a comment to say it's not all that bad! In reality, half a pound is hardly anything. 3500 calories is one pound of fat. Therefore 1750 calories is 0.5 pounds of fat. A 1750 calorie deficit isn't too big, and can be easily lost within a couple of days. It can even be lost that quickly at a healthy, non ""eating disordered"" rate! And that's not even taking into consideration water/sodium weight. 

Sometimes our illness can make larger numbers seem scary. It sucks, but your not alone here3 . I hope you're having a great day.      Slightly hungover from last night, with no idea how many calories I ate. Oh well.

I finished lunch at 12:15pm and I think I am done for the day. I might fast for 24 hours, but we'll see if I can get away with it.

**Total**: 315 calories.      Haha, thanks for the ""advice"". I think my friend was mainly worried because she knew I had an eating disorder to begin with. So she already had raised suspicion.        I went on vacation recently with some friends and I walked 20K+ steps for two days in a row! It's doable but my legs hurt pretty bad haha. Shows just how out of shape I am. Good luck with your goal!!      Aweh Thanks, you're so sweet. But yeah it can be scary almost having your secret revealed. I never thought of the cavity thing, I guess I'll have to add that to my growing list of excuses. Thanks     Hey! Your stats look great. If I were you I wouldn't worry too much, (although I know that is easier said than done!). The people ""talking behind your back"" might just be the ED part of your head talking for you. Chances are he was just concerned, as rapid weight loss is easier to observe.  Based on his previous comments, it seems he is just looking out for you!
Hope you are having a great day!   Almost caught purging on vacation.  Hello everyone!

Sorry that I haven't posted much, or did any food diaries the last couple days. I actually have been on vacation in the city with my friends. Turns out, I came back with a story to tell. 

 While I was on vacation, I was very worried that I might have to eat ""normally"" around my friends in order to avoid raising suspicion. I figured 3 meals a day couldn't be /too/ bad... especially since I was walking alot too, I thought I would burn some extra calories. But I forgot about how anxious I feel when it comes to eating around others and eating out at a restaurant. Since we were on vacation, we ate out three times each day with snacks in between aswell. I really wanted to avoid purging, but I will admit that i did purge a couple times. It was just too much to handle. I thought no one noticed at the time (I always said I was just going to the bathroom, no one came with me ever). 

It wasn't until the last meal, when another guy who was on vacation came into the washrooms and asked me what I was doing.. Apparently one of the girls on the trip (most of my friends are female) sent him into the washroom to check in on me and make sure I was okay. He mentioned how she (the girl who sent him in here) thought it was odd that I went to the washroom after every meal. I told him I was fine, and no one ever brought anything up after that. Although I technically wasn't caught purging, I totally thought that I blew my cover right then are there.

 This was way too close of a call. It's August 5th...For those of you who don't know, I am moving 6-8 hours away come September. I will be alone with no one who knows about past history with ana. 

I've made it this far being low-key about my ED...tricking friends... family... and therapists. 

I cannot screw up now.     Hey and welcome to the sub! I'm so glad I was able to inspire you to participate!(: I Hope you enjoy your stay~      Don't worry! Everything will be fine. 

I have had days like this in the past too. It is always reassuring (for me atleast) to remind myself that ""A calorie is a calorie"". In terms of weight loss, it doesn't really matter if that calorie came from brownies or spinach (although nutrition is a different story). 

As long as you are eating under your TDEE, or maintenance value , it's impossible for you to gain any real weight. If the scale goes up a bit after a binge, it's most likely water weight.  There is no need to worry(:   I almost gave myself away.  Hello friends - Today I have a little mini story/rant for you. 

So I was at a friend's place yesterday and we were playing a version of family feud. If you don't know what family feud is, it's a game show where you have to guess the most popular responses to survey questions. In the game, you usually have to answer as fast as you can in order to go first.


So we were all having a wonderful time. Then, it was my turn again. The thing with this game, is that it's primarily about responding fast, so it can reveal a lot of your subconscious thoughts. The question was ""I love the feeling of being ___"" . Without even thinking, I hit the button and said ""hungry"". I was NOT thinking of the social context I was in. As soon as I said it, I wished that I could take it back. I got a lot of weird stares. Fortunately for me, it was actually the 4th most common response. A couple people started laughing and said things like ""who in their right mind enjoys being hungry? lolol"". I laughed along with them and tried to play it off as a joke. 


There was only one girl in the room who knew that I had an eating disorder. She knew that I went to inpatient not too long ago because of it too. Luckily for me, her mind seemed to be somewhere else because I don't think she picked up on the little exchange that just happened. Or maybe she did, but she just didn't say anything - who knows?


Anyways, that is my story of the day. 


TLDR:  I almost exposed myself and my eating disorder in a game of family feud, but I don't think anyone really picked up on it.       Thanks everyone for the kind words33. I had a great time with my friends. I had some cake and didn't end up purging either which was a plus. I checked the scale this morning, and it didn't go up which made me really happy.(:   Today is my Birthday. Wish me luck.  Hey everyone,

Today is my birthday and so far it's been going great. The only thing is that I am surrounded by a ton of food, especially sweets, such as cake. I can't deny it without the people close to me getting suspicious. It's stressing me out a bit but I know I will be able to lose it all in the future. 

On a side note, I only have a little over two weeks of therapy left, and then I am home free to lose as much weight as I want. I just gotta keep up the facade until then. 


I'm a little anxious about eating ""unsafe"" junk food - please send good vibes my way.

Hope you guys are having a good day.
     I am a male, and at my lowest weight I had a BMI of 15.4 and weighed 104 lbs.  To be honest, I didn't really notice to much of a difference in either size nor girth down there... most of the fat came from my stomach,chest, face and other normal areas. However it is worth mentioning that when you are that thin there is an obvious decrease in libido. I had very little sexual interest at the time.       You look great! Amazing stats too!(:     I am guilty of googling this in the past too. I used to donate quite often (I believe 6 or 7 times) not only for the calorie reason, but for the charitable reasons as well. The only problem is that they weigh you every time you donate blood. I was once questioned about why I was losing weight so fast. I had to stop because I fell below the weight limit to donate blood. Here in Canada it was 110lbs.      I'm getting by... day by day...

my ED is a trusted friend... it won't break up with me, or leave my side. It gives me comfort.
     Best movie ever33     Without giving away too much personal info, I was diagnosed with a physical disease that will greatly impact my life in the years to come. This, along with other factors (eg. Childhood trauma, depression), put alot of stress on things I couldn't control. So I took control of my life by eating less food. Now, my eating disorder feels like a coping mechanism. If the voices in my head are constantly nagging me about food, It stops me from focusing on other shitty stuff.     I finished my 24 hour fast today. It felt good to restrict again - but I can't afford to lose weight without worrying everyone. Only 2 more sessions of therapy... So today is a maintenance day.

If you think you can handle going vegetarian/vegan I would say give it a shot, because it has alot beneficial aspects outside of losing weight/ED related things (eg. Environmental, Animal welfare, etc.) . However with that being said, we must keep our diagnosis in mind as well. Not all veggies have eating disorders, but it's common for people with eating disorders to be veggies. I only want to mention this because it could potentially be a slippery slope that leads to restriction. All in all, it's completely your call and no ones elses. You eat what you want to eat!(:    Away at University  Hey guys,

So a couple of you guys may have remembered my posts from a while back, where I talked about skipping over therapy and moving away from everyone in order to go to university. Many people including my friends/ family at home were very worried about me moving so far because 2-3 months prior I was hospitalized for my eating disorder. (If I am being honest with myself, I probably should have taken a year off in order to really give recovery a shot).. but I told everyone that I would be okay and they didn't have to worry. 

And now that I am here at university, things are just so -- surreal. Like, I don't know anyone here? No one gets concerned when I say that I don't want to go have breakfast. In a way its slightly liberating that no one is hovering over my back.. but at the same time, it's really stressful because i have to eat in the residence cafeteria where there are thousands of people eating. And I /cannot/ eat around that many people. I have a very select few that I can eat in front of... and they are all back at home over 8 hours away. 

I still really haven't figured out how I am going to eat at all here. I haven't made any solid friends and I feel pretty uncomfortable eating around anyone here.  Ontop of all that, classes begin tomorrow and I feel like that will just add to the stress levels. 


Sorry if this post sounded very ranty, I just had a lot on my chest and I thought I would update you guys in the process of it all. 

I'm pretty lonely so far from home, so feel free to message me anytime.      This is a feeling I've been able to relate to for a long time now.... I just wanted to say that if you need to talk to anyone, I am here for you and you can PM me.      Breakfast:Skipped

Note: Now that I'm done therapy, my goal is to stay around 130-133 lbs until I move out (which is in a couple days). I ended up restricting though... by 2pm today, I will have completed a 24 hour fast. Not sure if I should end it, or see how long I can continue. I don't want to raise to much suspicion before I leave. I will update later.   Does anyone else hear voices?  Hello friends,

Sorry if this post seems a little ""out of the norm"". But a thought recently came to my attention. Before I had an eating disorder, I didn't really understand the illness that well. I was ignorant, and thought it was all about being underweight. Now I realize that there is a strong mental component aswell. In the beginning, it was described to me as ""disordered thoughts"". But as I ventured farther and farther into therapy I realized multiple therapists/doctors refer to the ""ED voice"" aka those disordered thoughts. 

I've seen it time and time again on posts across the internet but I don't know if it's been really addressed. When you guys hear ""the voice of ana/ed"" in your mind, do you hear it as if it was an actual auditory hallucination? I heard some people do and some people don't. 

For me, it can vary. Sometimes it just feels like very strong thoughts that aren't my own (whether I recognize it or not). Other times the voice feels so clear, I can give it a gender. For me, ""ED"" doesn't feel like a suitable name because it feels a lot more feminine in nature. Hence why I prefer ""ana"". 

I guess a natural extension of this question, is do you considered yourself delusional? Delusions (aka strong, fixed, false beliefs) is generally a marker of a psychiatric illness, such as ""I believe aliens implanted a microchip into my brain"". I've heard it argued before that people with anorexia suffer from the delusion that they are ""severely overweight, despite being extremely underweight"" .... However, personally, I have a hard time believing this one. For the most part, I actually do feel as if I have a lot more weight to lose. 

Anyways, back on topic. When your ""ED voice"" is going off in your mind, do you guys actually (sometimes) hear auditory hallucinations? Or would you consider it just strong, obstructive thoughts? 

I'm curious about this topic!(:      Hoping to eat nothing. Although I did say that yesterday as well... I think I am noticing a pattern lol.      Hello! And welcome to our community. 3(:      Personally, when I was first diagnosed I refused to believe it. So I guess you could say that my diagnosis forced me to take a good look at myself..

I made sure today was a restrictive, low carb day. Hopefully it will help shed some of that water/sodium weight.   It's finally over.  Today is the day I have reached a goal.


It's not a weight loss goal. It's not a calorie restriction goal. It's not a fasting goal. 

 nbsp;

I have finally escaped therapy.

 nbsp;

A couple months back, when I was near my lowest weight, I thought I could tell my therapist about the voice in my head telling me that ""I wasn't worth the food"". She spent many weeks working with me through psychotherapy, but to no avail. My weight was still dropping dramatically. When I reached my lowest weight, she gave me an ultimatum. I could either go to hospital to get myself checked out, or they would call an ambulance. She said if I tried to run, she would call the police and they would force me into hospital. After two painful weeks on a psych ward, I was discharged and put into outpatient therapy. Ever since therapists, doctors and my parents have been monitoring my weight/ food intake.


I long for the days where no one knew about my illness. I long for the days where I could fast for days and no one gave a damn. The voice of ana in my head truly regrets ever letting anyone know about it's existence.


That's when I decided I am going to get those times of secrecy back. On September 3rd, I am moving far far away for university. Far away from anyone I have ever known, or loved. 


I have been working for this, for a very long time. It took a lot of carefully planned lies and deceit. The entire month of August I have been skipping meals and purging. I have been rigging the scales at the doctors office with weights. I am a horrible human being. 


Today was my last ""weigh in"". From here on out, no one will be monitoring me. I move away in less than two weeks. I will not be continuing therapy when I am there, despite what my current therapist wants. 

 nbsp;

This time, No one can stop me on my long descent into starvation.        After the success of the 3 day fast, I think I am going to attempt another fast (atleast 24 hours). Wish me luck!

For me, I both restrict and fast alot of the time. From a personal experience, I always find fasting easier. If I eat as little as 200-300 calories in a day, I find myself with alot of hunger and cravings. 

However, when I fast I find that the hunger cravings just stop after the 2nd day. Currently, i am three days into a fast and I feel fine (although I will probably end it soon). 

Fasting is also easier on me psychologically because i don't have to worry or even think about foods/calories. 

I guess this is all just personal opinion though. Both severe restriction and fasting will cause you to lose weight.      I officially hit the 72 hour mark of my fast! That's three days! I decided today that I wanted to break the fast with 1,400 calories of healthy foods.

Still fasting away. I currently feel great. No ill effect - Infact I feel powerful and strong. Let's see how this goes~

Scale: 129 lbs     Male here!

 I definitely have insecure thoughts about it too, especially if my SO is aware of my ED. Also, as a general rule, the more underweight I am, the less libido I have. 

Thought I would provide a different perspective~~     Ever since I got away to university, I have completed two separate 24 hour fasts. I plan to go for a larger fast these next couple days, but I decided to eat a healthy 1200 meal first. It was really difficult for me but I was able to do it:

Breakfast: Skipped

Lunch: Res Lunch of Veggies and Beans with soy milk (1200 calories)

     Thats great news! I'm so proud of you!     Just finished up another 48 hour fast. I'm tempted to attempt 72 hours, but my rational mind says otherwise. I just did a 72 hour fast a couple days ago, and only had 24 hours of eating in between. I guess we will see what happens.

Update: I gave in and tried to eat ""Non disordered"". My rational mind decided it was the right thing to do. I'll probably go exercise tonight though and abuse diuretics anyways.

Scale: 128 lbs     Haha, no. I think there might of been some miscommunication! ""Vitamin Zero"" Is a vitamin drink with zero calories! I had one during my fast in order to replenish my vitamins.      I didn't drink any salt water;however, I did have a vitamin zero during my fast at around the 36 hour mark. 

If I were going any longer, I definitely would have had some salt water. It's a good idea to replenish your electrolytes when attempt a fast (especially one 3+ days)   3 day fast completed!  Hey guys!

As some of you may know, I've been doing some experimenting with fasting ever since I got to university. So far I have completed 2 separate 24 hour fasts, along with one 72 hour fast. In the past (when my anorexia was at it's worst) I completed a one week fast. 

For some reason, this new obsession has started where I am counting how many hours I can go fasting without food, instead of obsessing over how few calories I can eat in a day. Don't get me wrong, I still count calories very strictly - I've just been experimenting with the length of fasts as well. It's so much easier psychologically on me to because you don't even have to consider calories at all. 

Anyways, enough rambling - Here is the breakdown of my 3 day fast:

 nbsp;

**Start of Fast**

 nbsp;

**T + 0 hrs: 133 lbs**

- The first 24 hour of a fast is always the hardest in my opinion. Not much to say here, except for you just gotta stick through it. 

**T+ 24 hrs: 131.5 lbs**

- After the initial 24 hours it does become a little easier... At about 36 hours in I went to a concert which involved alot of standing. After the concert, I was invited back to a new friends place to have some drinks, but I wanted to stay true to myself. I went, but we ended up just talking and all staying sober.

**T+ 48 hrs: 130 lbs**

- By this point, all hunger stopped really. For me this is normal. I felt a little dizzy and weak at times but nothing out of the ordinary. My guess is that my body was switching into ketosis around this time. I also had a nap that day as I felt more tired than usual. 

**T+ 72 hrs: 127 lbs**

- After 72 hours, I ended my fast. Honestly, I felt completely fine (I wasn't even hungry). But I decided it was for the better to go out and try to have a ""social meal"" (which I seriously struggle with). They say if you can make it to 3 days, you have conquered the hardest part. I probably could have went a couple more days easily. 

 nbsp;

**After Fast: 128 lbs**

The day after my fast, I ate 1400 calories and weighed in a pound heavier than the day before. I tried not freak out at this, as I knew I would gain some water and food weight back. However thats still a 
**5 pound decrease in 3 days**! Hooray!!

      I also grew up in a place where there wasn't unlimited food. But recently I bought a /ton/ of triggering foods only to throw it all down the garbage shoot before I could even eat it. On one hand I felt proud that I didn't give in.... but I felt so guilty for wasting that food (and the money). 

Ive also been in restaurants, ordered food, had one bite, then got it ""to go"" so I could throw it out while walking down the street. Eating disorders are weird.      Sticking to my 23:1 IF , 500 calories diet for a while.

Breakfast: Skipped

Lunch: Banana (105), Oranges (130), Tofu (240), Lettuce (10)

Dinner: Skipped

Total: 485 calories     Well, now that my 7 day fast is over I am going back to restricting. Yesterday I had a ""non restricting"" day when I came off the fast, so I obviously maintained alot of water weight. I am going to watch it for the next couple days... hopefully I don't go crazy from this weight fluctuation.  It's nearly 6-8 pounds worth. I didn't even eat that much food.

Today, like usual, I am going to break my fast with raw vegetables like Lettuce,Cucumbers, Bananas, Oranges,etc. For the sake of my sanity, I will not count calories today. 

I lost 13 pounds in total, but I will definitely gain some water weight once food enters my digestive system again. I am hoping this will only be around 3 to 5 pounds though, so I still have some sort of loss.      I've been drinking plain water, with the occasional diet coke for Sodium and Caffeine. (:      Today is the 6th day of my fast. I plan to break my fast tomorrow, which will make seven days. I am already dreaming of what I will eat lol.

subject758,"    I googled her and ha, that's not me..but interesting.     in terms of book genres- fiction, surrealism/realism, horror, suspense.

It is somewhat heavy, but it's definitely sort of relieving to read, just in my perspective haha. To each their own I guess!

in terms of music I've pretty much been listening to the smiths or girly stuff like Grimes and Crystal Castles.. and a bunch of classical/acoustic/instrumentals from my favorite movies, 

it's really cliche.. I know.

Thanks for distracting me by the way.. It's helping me not think too much about things.     Breaking Bad, I suppose. I read a lot of Murakami and I've recently reread Invisible Monsters by Palahniuk. 

I guess it's pretty small stuff like this that keeps me alive. 

Either that, or something bad.  I'm a 19 (F) and I guess this is my story. Death seems like a great solution.    I'm a 19 year old girl. 

  I'm mentally ill.

 I don't think I've ever fully typed out my life story on a website, or written it down anywhere before, so prepare for a TLDR or skip to the bottom. 

Ever since I was a young child, domestic abuse was a common thing growing up. My father was abusive towards my family and I, and we had to put it up with it almost every single day. 

Everyone suffered. My sisters, my mother, even my own relatives suspected what was going on but no one intervened.

At age 12, I was molested by my first therapist/counselor at school, I kept it a secret until my early teens. Bullying seemed of the norm or common to me, so I put up with that as well as my grades suffered. I was in denial of what happened for a very long time and I

During high school at age 15, I experienced a traumatic experience from an incident with my dad and I had to leave the house the move in with my aunt. CPS and the police were involved, I had to go to court a lot, it was horrible. I developed my eating disorder at this age and I ended up dropping out of school. I was not missed.

From then on, everything got worse.

 Suicide/OD attempts, jumping into traffic, self-harm, binging and purging- I hated myself. I experienced a lot of shitty traumatic events. I put myself in unhealthy relationships, dropped out of college, and ended up having to go to rehab because I decided I needed help after having my whole family just get so sick of it. I was definitely not sober before rehab, but I pretended to function well and it was taking a toll on my body, along with my eating disorder which is currently very active.

When I left rehab, I relapsed. 

I took all my sleeping pills (a months worth) in one go and drank some booze. I was saved by my sister.

After I left the hospital,

 I went into an eating disorders program, and got discharged the first day I was there. I basically; could not do it or handle it. I am not allowed there again, obviously- and my shitty therapist decided to drop me because she didn't want to be liable for anything in case I actually do kill myself. Now I am left with no therapist, I am currently in an extremely dysfunctional relationship with someone who constantly puts me down, and I always find myself loving him more than he loves me.. But I don't have anyone else.. and I have NO friends, or family to confide in. I have no job, I can't go to school right now until January, and I'm desperately trying to find help.

I feel stupid and useless, and ugly, and just a waste of space.

Everything just seems really fucking terrible. 

And I've put my mother in debt about 50 grand... 

I just really wish I were dead this time.
     two experiences. 

My grandma and auntie had made some shanghainese food- 

simmered pork belly, lobster, with the roe and egg noodles, and shrimp+pork stuffed hot peppers. 

Another was when I was in the hospital, almost dying and eating liquidy bullshit, Ensure, and fake ass eggs for 3 days, later I decided to order some Thai food while I was still in there and it was literally the best thing I've ever tasted. Fucking spicy goodness.     my sister and I walked in on our grandpas caretaker screaming because.. he somehow ""accidentally"" stabbed himself in the eyeball when we were little kids      crying.     wtFFuuHHuhaskjaf. ???     Ridiculously photogenic male bungee jumps in wheel chair. '~'     ""I bet she fucks like a fairy on acid.""     I don't know why but this makes me angry to look at. 
Because I need to split all of them apart. :(     too cute      My mother always refers to this hot sauce as the sad hot sauce because of the face. Good with dumplings and noodles!     My boyfriend was that half Asian teen selling trinkets to strangers in a Safeway parking lot. Thanks for sharing your story.     A year ago I had your hair color and I miss it dearly.     i am here if you need me. you aren't alone in this, and i know it could be devastating when your partner isn't there to comfort you while you're going through this and living with your diagnoses. please know that it isn't your fault if people don't understand you or your illness.     white hood white hood, oh k k k      Zoloft really made my hair fall out and feel dry, my skin was yellowing as well. Sometimes I felt like I could manage my anxiety while on it but I'd end up feeling physically sick/malaise throughout the whole day. In the end, it didn't work out for me for like 4 months.     I remember hiking that trail last year and twisting my ankle. Saw a lot of salamanders though. Cool shot.     out of curiosity did you go to nightlife a week or two ago?     hey girl hmu!      Nutritional Yeast Infection     We have the same taste in music!!     I just saw this guy in San Francisco. No joke.     Unpopular opinion but the KVD liquid lipsticks are super drying on my lips... seriously, WTF     Wish we could get an AMA from her     I feel like you're the perfect cross between Arya and Siri from the Witcher. I don't really have any good tips for makeup tho      All of the above, same.      holy fuck. My sisters friend is unaccounted for and went to the venue yesterday, it breaks my heart and I do wonder how the fire was started. From what it seems, it had a lot of flammable objects and it was severely lacking in safety measures. I wasn't there and I can't accuse this guy because who the fuck knows who really happened. My heart hurts      Picking my nose and scratching my wedgie in public. :(     Got2Be texturizing hair pomade is something that I use that smells very STRONGLY of vanilla and marshmallows. Seriously, look it up and try it for yourself. It's good on different types of hair as well, I have layered medium length to short hair.     It was actually really good. I used a 6lb pork butt instead of an 8-10 lb one and could have easily fed 7-8 people. For the brown sugar and salt glaze, I added in a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar so that it would stick to the meat better. my family and I are looking forward to leftovers!     Making this right now and it's almost done, man I'm excited.      SMASH AND BURN PLS     grow your hair a bit more and you can be Tintin. :3     You do realize masturbation feels like pizza tastes.     I've eaten at this place and let me tell you, I never liked it. And I am certainly not coming back after seeing this, lol.     I can relate and I hope one day I'll reach contentment and a sober-free lifestyle and manage my ED.     I need to get my ass back to an NA/AA/OA/whatever 12 step meeting and I'm ashamed that my old sponsor will know if I relapsed.     I'm a 19 year old female.

I was addicted to Vicodin/OxyContin/Oxycodone for a good year and then I had to go to rehab, the worst part was also dealing with an eating disorder at the same time and losing all my friends, dropping out of school, being hospitalized several times. It was shit. 

Life was about using, feeling numb, feeling in control, going to sleep, and doing the same shit over again+ having to pretend that you're okay and you're sober.

Absolute fucking shit it is, and I just relapsed and I struggle as I'm currently typing this. The worst part is how badly I want to stop but I don't know how I'd live or manage without drugs, my eating disorder, or anything addictive that's bad for me. I'm struggling and I desperately need help and I fucking hate ambivalence.     [someasiankid](http://25.media.tumblr.com/902cdf2169c433fd98fd5f261cdc30a1/tumblr_mulur6dmXH1shzdc1o1_500.jpg)

also I have a mole that's like, oddly placed.. and braces..oh yes, the teenage years are delightful.     ""I'm gonna come down super soon like couple minutes.""

wat     kittens will wander up your butt     Oh okay! No prob.     Thank you everyone for their support. 

I read everything.

I just hope I can persevere. Honestly, I don't know if I can. Wish me luck.      I'm on this/was on this and when I saw comments like this I just felt really depressed about it because us eating disordered people think in really distorted and contradicting ways. Some people into treatment just to get better to get out, to fall back into a relapse again. It's really sad.     This is what I was thinking.     say that fast and it is a tongue twister     does anyone know the story behind where this was or who this girl is..     I'm a San Franciscan, hello. I'm quite awkward.     I read everything. Thank you for sharing. I hope you're doing well nowadays. 

You're not allowed to contact him anymore? Would you, if you had the chance?     How are you doing nowadays in terms of staying self-harm free? Do you still have these thoughts?     ...I'm done.     i would wear them.     Good ole' witch house..?     Love.     Your cat looks so much like my cat!      euthanasia     LSD, an eating disorder, PTSD, having the best fuck of your life, eating pizza after smoking weed.     Lots of socks. I lose them.     Do you ever miss the cold when it gets super duper hot and then feel all bad? :/ I wish you best of luck.     i've done this shit before and i literally just space out and ask myself where the soup went. and then i'm like, 
oh shit i'm a dumbass.     i work at cvs and this shit never happens     please be okay.     that looks really good! I'm not sure what I'd substitute for olives though, I'm not a big fan. Did you serve it with any type of rice? Or just bread?     can't stop laughing omfg     moan alone :(     http://instagram.com/p/hndozRPO8z/

The mole is perfectly placed. (the other one on the side of my face is a piercing)     resentments are toxic and some people spend their whole lives being bitter. Not to say they don't have good reasons, but whatever their reasons are are holding them back from being content+peaceful in their lives/happy.      I am currently in therapy but my therapist is in Japan, I was seeking help for it/went to treatment but I got kicked out because I wasn't following the rules. Currently, I'm at a healthy weight (everyone thinks I'm all better now lol) and I'm ambivalent towards recovery. I know that if I relapse, I'd lose a lot of valuable things in my life but I don't know if I care enough.  I am a bulimic 19 y/o girl that just binged. AMA!  I'm also suffering from food poisoning from this past week and I have been diagnosed with a handful of mental illnesses. Currently, I feel like shit and I need a distraction. 

Ask away!     A simple way would be stir frying it with minced garlic, salt, pepper and then adding sesame oil, sesame seeds, and minced green onions on top at the end. Usually I let it sit in the fridge till it gets cold and I have it over hot white rice.

They're also fantastic in Pad Thai.     well, I have CIGNA and I know how you feel.     gummy worms and reeses peanut butter cups     WHO'S THAT POKEMON?   Me [19 F] with BPD+ED dating my AVPD boyfriend [23 M]. I think our personalities are starting to clash. (semi long description). (trigger warning)  [removed]     Totally my goal! Thanks man. I need to check it out. My stats are almost the same as Jennette McCurdys (even the same height,around 105-110 lbs) I just need to tone up.     I find that snacking on fruit really helps.     The third one, holy shit, I wish I had her body :(     arrest me officer 
-swoon-     i have the same one..      I don't drink much soda or eat much candies/junk but I think I really don't drink enough water. That may be my problem..  I've been 1 week without cigarettes.. my skin is breaking out like crazy? help me?  so I'm a 19 year old female and my skin has always had acne here and there, or occasional breakouts but my skin is seriously looking like a pepperoni pizza now. 

Can anyone relate? 
when does it end? 
should I just go to the gym and eat healthily? 

WHEN DOES THIS END

(I've been smoking for 2 years.)     I've had this before, it's super good. 
Thanks for the recipe.     My ex boyfriend was being molested by his mom.     Oh thanks haha.      How is it amazing?
     I don't have a TV, haha so I do know what you mean.      I used to purge so much that the brackets in my braces would always end up falling out or the metal would leave a terrible taste in my mouth. I forgot to add that I was a RECOVERING bulimic and I haven't purged in 2 months. The urges are there every single day though. It's not easy to stop, but it's possible. Over half of my thoughts are usually filled with guilt of how I need to purge and get food out of my body, but I know if I relapse I'd lose my job and drop out of the culinary program that I'm in.     I am feeling slightly better. 
It is raining hard outside and I hear thunder.
I'm just in bed, I don't know if I'm well enough to go to the gym today..I haven't gone in awhile.
Thanks. :)     I have braces. My teeth aren't so white, they're more clear and I really lack calcium. Sigh.     My BMI is 20.5 and I don't really want to discuss height and weight cause it can be triggering to some individuals     I had pizza at a nightclub.

Never again. It's been a week.      It's possibly something neurological as well and I'm looking into it.     That sounds like a good idea. I don't have a TV/consoles in my appt but I can dl some games on the laptop or something. Maybe I should read. Sigh..  disassociation from PTSD, co dependency, I am feeling so alone.  I am a 20 year old woman, with very few friends, a boyfriend who I am overly attached to, and several mental issues. 

A couple weeks ago, I was sexually assaulted outside of a concert venue- one that I didn't attend. I was waiting for my boyfriend to come out, and he never picked up his phone. He was too high/drunk/whatever. There are certain parts I don't remember, however this guy bit my lip and tried to get me to come home with him. He pushed me against a fire hydrant and left some gnarly bruises on my thigh. I am angry still, at my boyfriend- but it isn't his fault at all. The concert was supposed to end an hour earlier and I was at the wrong place, wrong time.

 I currently don't have a job, and a relative of mine is financially supporting me. Anyways, I left the culinary industry as a below mediocre cook and I'm planning to go to school during the fall for my degree. Right now, I can't even hold down a simple job because my mind is killing me.

As of right now, my PTSD is really fucking with me. I am blacking out often, and I don't remember doing or saying certain things- that I do. I find things placed in odd places and I hurt myself and I don't remember when or how. My boyfriend says it isn't me, when I sometimes talk to him..or other people. I hear voices, and I panic when I go outside, I can't really rely on my family. There are so many things that trigger me when I go outside.

 I have the apartment to myself for 1 week because my eldest sister and her boyfriend are on a trip to NY. My psych isn't here either. I really need support, or distractions. I don't know why I'm blacking out and I'm reliant on my 21 year old boyfriend who's willing to go therapy with me in a couple weeks, but he really doesn't understand. No one does, to be honest.

I've been having a lot of sex every time I see him. I haven't had a proper period in 5 months (I suffer from an ED but I'm at a normal weight and I'm not thin in my eyes). I'm really stressed. I can't help but to push him away even though I don't want him to go away. I'm on a low dose of Wellbutrin, btw.

TLDR; I feel so alone and I just want someone to be there.. :/

edit: i was diagnosed with PTSD before the incident I just mentioned.     that's something I need to definitely look into and try.     I'm really gonna try to seek some assistance somehow. I wish I could really find people who are experiencing the same thing/similar things as I am. Wish I could camp or chill with friends to get away from all the BS. Thanks for replying.     I'm down, but I'm in SF and this post is a bit old.. ah..     i was trying to walk home from work and this shit was going on..     reading this made my stomach twist.  please help me I am feeling so sick?  i've been smoking cigarettes for a long time..about 4 years. I'm 20 now, I went on a date with this boy yesterday and we smoked so much till we got sick. A pack and a half together, and one pack was one of those packs were those popping menthol packs. anyways i can't even sit up straight now, i have a fever, and i just took my patch off.
 
i work as a line cook, full time, as a 5 foot 2 girl.. it's really physically tiring and i don't even know how to feel better for work tomorrow. i feel so nauseated and i want to vomit     Good luck on your recovery. You can do this.     From age 15 till now (20) I've been there several times. 
I feel safe but at the same time too safe. When I leave the hospital, it's overwhelming because I'm faced with all my problems and these people again. I struggle with PTSD, BPD, anxiety, depression, an eating disorder. Everyday is a struggle.     Who's that Pokemon?      Orlando can't seem to catch a break.     My hair looks just like Coralines' now! Thanks! Maybe I'll post a pic tomorrow.  dyeing over dark green hair, don't know what color to choose, please help!  I've had medium length tealish green hair for months now, and I really want to change my hair color to something else. Im on my way to a beauty supply store later. I bleached it about 2-3 times in January, before applying on the greenish teal color (I used special effects forest green and joico's green for about 5 months now). I really don't want to bleach my hair again and my roots are showing (my hair sounds like a mess, lol sorry) so I'm leaning in towards something more darker.

 I was told that reddish purple cancels out the green tones but I have no idea what to color my hair next and what it'll look like. 

Would I be able to achieve a blue black color without bleaching it again? I'll post pictures soon. I really need some hair coloring advice! Thanks.


(edit) heres what my hair looks like 

https://www.instagram.com/p/BExpll6ldsC/?taken-by=deann.u     it's like cotton candy! :D     I have a frozen calf/beef liver in my fridge. I oughtta try this, but pan fried. I still have some pomegranate molasses and some spices leftover to use, thanks!     u asked for it     This is disgusting. I'm so sorry this happened to you. Something similar happened to me when I was a minor as well..if you want to talk about it, please message me.     you're right, I need to find things that'll be not detrimental for my health, I should try taking care of myself better.      I am really overwhelmed by all the support right now. In a good way though. Thank you so much guys. I really needed this.  I'm feeling separation anxiety and I need people to talk to. (21,f)  I temporarily quit my job as a line cook to go on medical leave for a kidney infection that I'm recovering from. I'm feeling anxious without my boyfriend by my side and my life is really complicated, sort of lacking friends at the moment. I'm just at home, while it's a nice, warm and beautiful day and I can't enjoy it. I recently relapsed and everything's gone to poop. I don't want to cut myself right now and I am seeing my therapist tomorrow for a 2 hour session.

Just wondering if anyone could befriend me right now, it would be great. :/     many people mention Lana, Marina   the Diamonds also-
Meg Myers is an AMAZING artist that speaks deeply to me. 
Monster, Desire, Adelaide- brilliant songs. ^

     Hey. I was/am in your situation, you are not alone. Message me, we can talk. I really feel for you. :(      I miss this!!!     I had some homemade smoked ham, cut into strips kind of resembling bacon or really thick pancetta to my vodka sauce. I just added like, what I think was the tip or small chunk of a scotch bonnet sans the seeds to this vodka sauce recipe, and it was pretty bomb. (I made a ton of sauce haha) The result was an all pleasantly warm-spicy, but not overbearingingly hot pasta. It was very good. I've done it with habanero before and I agree, it's pretty good as well.  Catsitting rambunctious non-stop meowing young cat that keeps begging for food and attention.  Adopted 1 yr 2 mnths female Calico, her name is Daisy. Daisy was in a house with 28 other cats, and lived with a really fat old hoarder until she was taken away by a shelter a couple cities away. 



Fast forward, my sister who doesn't clean her apartment (seriously, theres maggots and silverfish) obligates that I cat-sit for her when she's gone. I'm thinking, maybe the cleanliness has something to do with the cats behavior or my sisters and her boyfriends disappearance. anyways this isn't about my sister- For the next week and a half, I have to cat-sit Daisy. a pretty big duplex, two litter boxes in two separate rooms, eats fresh organic chicken with her food half of the time.

 (her meal plan is 2 small fancy feast cans a day over the course of 3-4 meals,
 first fed at 5:30am or earlier ..wtf,
 and then 10AM, 
and then 3PM-6pm.  

a palmful of dry food/organic chicken shreds or ground beef is included usually)

So for the past 3 days, I haven't been able to sleep. She sleeps for like- 5 hours a day (so far) and she is constantly meowing, jumping on me while sleeping, knocking over things/breaking them, sitting in the kitchen begging for food, yowling at like 2AM in my ears.. I haven't actually been able to get any sleep. Keep in my that meal plan was a vets/my sisters, so I've tried to push the meals later in the day but she keeps fucking YOWLING. I really need help guys. Do I buy Feliway or should I lock her in a room at night? 

I can't sleep. :/      I would really want to try making a roasted duck with mint sauce, and maybe some soba noodle salad tossed with fresh herbs, edamame, and shitaake. But eh, it's a maybe!     If anyone wants to meet up, message me! Everyone in my neighborhood seems like they're red or blue.     Sweet, thanks! this games gonna make me get out of the house more. Mind I mention near the diamond heights Safeway and Christopher playground, I caught two jigglypuffs and I've seen pikachu around but I haven't caught one yet.     I live in Diamond Heights near Glen Canyon, I've found many eevees and eventually evolved one into a Jolteon.     Yup. I live near twin peaks ;-;     Girl with teal blue hair here. I'm Asian too and Asian hair can be pretty stubborn taking in bleach. Having an orange tint to your hair is totally normal and bleaching it again using the same process you did (in a couple days) should bring you to a more yellow banana blond tone. If your scalp is bleeding or skin is really itchy, I'd wait a week till bleaching again. You can also use a purple toner shampoo or a toner to get the brassy parts out of your hair before you dye it.I used a combination of blue velvet and forest green (I think that's the name) from Special effects, but the green from Joico works as well.     I took all my trazadone and washed it down with alcohol, in an attempt to kill myself. I had my stomach pumped and the entire time nurses and emts were trying to not have me sleep on them. it was September 11th, 3 years ago. I woke up really confused, not really scared, but I didn't know what I did. I feel like I hit my head really hard. The next week I just put the pieces together, I was just some depressed sop trying to off myself lol. I guess I'm doing better.     Hopefully he gets what he deserves in prison.     Every time I received a dick pic I just texted them back a picture of a bigger dick.      I googled her and ha, that's not me..but interesting.

It is somewhat heavy, but it's definitely sort of relieving to read, just in my perspective haha. To each their own I guess!

it's really cliche.. I know.

Either that, or something bad.  I'm a 19 (F) and I guess this is my story. Death seems like a great solution.    I'm a 19 year old girl. 

  I'm mentally ill.

 I don't think I've ever fully typed out my life story on a website, or written it down anywhere before, so prepare for a TLDR or skip to the bottom. 

Ever since I was a young child, domestic abuse was a common thing growing up. My father was abusive towards my family and I, and we had to put it up with it almost every single day. 

Everyone suffered. My sisters, my mother, even my own relatives suspected what was going on but no one intervened.

At age 12, I was molested by my first therapist/counselor at school, I kept it a secret until my early teens. Bullying seemed of the norm or common to me, so I put up with that as well as my grades suffered. I was in denial of what happened for a very long time and I

During high school at age 15, I experienced a traumatic experience from an incident with my dad and I had to leave the house the move in with my aunt. CPS and the police were involved, I had to go to court a lot, it was horrible. I developed my eating disorder at this age and I ended up dropping out of school. I was not missed.

From then on, everything got worse.

 Suicide/OD attempts, jumping into traffic, self-harm, binging and purging- I hated myself. I experienced a lot of shitty traumatic events. I put myself in unhealthy relationships, dropped out of college, and ended up having to go to rehab because I decided I needed help after having my whole family just get so sick of it. I was definitely not sober before rehab, but I pretended to function well and it was taking a toll on my body, along with my eating disorder which is currently very active.

When I left rehab, I relapsed. 

I took all my sleeping pills (a months worth) in one go and drank some booze. I was saved by my sister.

After I left the hospital,

 I went into an eating disorders program, and got discharged the first day I was there. I basically; could not do it or handle it. I am not allowed there again, obviously- and my shitty therapist decided to drop me because she didn't want to be liable for anything in case I actually do kill myself. Now I am left with no therapist, I am currently in an extremely dysfunctional relationship with someone who constantly puts me down, and I always find myself loving him more than he loves me.. But I don't have anyone else.. and I have NO friends, or family to confide in. I have no job, I can't go to school right now until January, and I'm desperately trying to find help.

I feel stupid and useless, and ugly, and just a waste of space.

Everything just seems really fucking terrible. 

And I've put my mother in debt about 50 grand... 

I just really wish I were dead this time.

[Rant] The end of my first love: a one sided relationship *Warning: very long ;)*  It's been 10 days since the relationship officially ended. We met when I was a high school freshman and he was a sophomore. Me being a complete tomboy and only having friendships with guys never had a real crush before. When I saw him my first thought was, ""Wow, he's really cute. ""WTF WAS I THINKING? I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT GUYS THAT WAY."" I was the one that made fun of all my friends who obsessed over boys. I wasn't going to be that girl.

I failed. Later that night I friended him on Facebook. He accepted and we constantly chatted for weeks and weeks. I didn't like him at the time. His good friend told me he liked me and that absolutely shocked me. It was the first time I knew of a guy liking me. Naturally, I started liking him back. Once I got the balls to do something about my feelings, it was too late. He stopped liking me and got a girlfriend. She was tall and cute. I fucking hated that bitch.

We stayed good friends, though. I introduced him to a lot of people including my best guy friend (a huge mistake since this friend of mine introduce him to his next girlfriend). He eventually broke up with his girlfriend and I had high hopes for myself, but refused to let anyone know that I still liked him, including he, himself. He jokingly asked me out constantly to which I obviously responded, ""no, fuck off"" even though I liked him. He continued flirting with me.

The summer of my sophomore year, everything changed. This boy changed me. We went to see Guardians of the Galaxy (I know, super romantic) along with another guy friend. My crush and I ended up cuddling and he ended up feeling me up amongst other things (yes, the other friend was sitting next to us in the theater, BUT HE WAS WATCHING THE MOVIE AND WAS NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO US). This was, again, a first for me. 

Two days later he asked another girl out. **Two fucking days after he took advantage of me.** All of my friends were so happy for the two of them. She was ""pretty, nice and all around perfect."" I was beyond depressed.

It was hard being in the same friend group as the two of them and **extremely hard** ignoring the boy when he sent me snapchats jokingly flirting with me while in a relationship. A little over a month after they got together, I was asked out by one of my best friends. I accepted. We lasted for 3 months until I ended things due to me still having feelings for this other boy and failing to put in effort into the relationship.

One night my crush and I were messaging and he told me that he was thinking of breaking up with this girl. I was confused. He said she was too immature for him and wanted to fuck around with other girls. I should've ended the conversation there, but I didn't. I was dumb and continued talking to him. After all, he was my good friend.

I invited him to my sister's engagement party. He told me how pretty I looked and complimented me over and over. Later after the party, we all went to my friend's house and watched a movie. During the movie, the boy sat me on his lap, unzipped the back of my dress and gave me a back massage. Yes, he still had a girlfriend. Yes, I'm a fucking idiot and a bitch.

The night they broke up, he came over to my house to tutor me in math. He wasn't really helpful due to his tears smudging the paper and him not concentrating at all. I decided that we should just stop with math and go play some video games. After 20 minutes his ride came. Before walking him to the door, he kissed me. He left.

He messaged me immediately after saying that I can't tell a soul. I told him I wouldn't, which was complete bullshit. He told me he wasn't ready for a girlfriend yet, but wanted to be FWB. I freaked out at him and refused. He kept insisting. I stopped talking to him. 

One night I got stuck at his house with a bunch of my friends. He and I were still fighting. He decided to be funny and had us watch Guardians of the Galaxy. All of my friends knew what happened the night we saw it in theaters and thought it was hilarious that he did this. I was on the verge of tears. I tried avoiding and ignoring him for the rest of the night, but he came under my blanket on the floor and apologized. I forgave him and we started making out under the blanket. Once everyone fell asleep, he took me to his garage, laid me down on his workout bench, and started feeling me up ~~and eventually fingering me~~. Another first. Afterward, he asked me to give him a blowjob. I refused.

The day after, he was pissed at me for not sucking his dick. He complained about his blue balls and how much pain he was in. I felt terrible. He said he regretted doing what we did in his garage and that I can't tell anyone. I was so hurt. I loved him.

I found out that my crush was talking to our guy friends about getting back together with his ex-girlfriend and how he never stopped loving her. I was distraught. I realized I was completely taken advantage of. I spent the next week crying in bed. My friends came to visit me and bought be a stuffed sheep. I named it after this guy, but his name spelled backward. He saw my snapchat story of my stuffed sheep and asked who got it for me. I told him my friends and he was pissed. He explained that he was having a hard time too, ""being in love with two girls at the same time.""

Eventually, he and his ex got back together. She never really found out the truth and is still with the asshole today. After months of pain and ignoring him, I decided to ""forgive him"" and be friends with him for the sake of my friends and my current boyfriend.

10 days ago, the day after my 4 month anniversary with my boyfriend, I noticed that this guy unfriended me. I confronted him about it. He said he wanted to end our friendship and cut all contact. I didn't understand why; I still don't really understand. At first I was so hurt but eventually accepted it. Yes, I lost my friend of 4 years, but he wasn't truly my friend. Yes, we had great times together, but he also hurt me so many times.

It's still hard because my current boyfriend is friends with him and hangs out with him all the time despite knowing our history. I'm nervous to visit my boyfriend at his college since he spends so much time with him, but I know my boyfriend loves me, will protect me and will always be on my side. I love him so much and can't believe I ever liked this other asshole.

**Thanks for reading my rant.**

My happy niece    Looking for a gift for my boyfriend  My boyfriend and I just celebrated our 6 month anniversary. We're both 18 and he's away at college while I'm still living with my parents and attending community college. He's a huge PC gamer and anime watcher. He's on the quiet side, a funny loser, and loves rap/hip hop. Long distance really sucks for us, but I get to see him at least once a month when I go up and stay for the weekend or he comes back home to visit. I'm not exactly flowing with money right now, but I'm willing to spend what I can on him. I loved the idea of [this](http://www.littleriot.com/pillow-talk/) gift, but obviously, it isn't available for purchase yet. He mentioned getting matching necklaces, but I don't even know where to start looking for that. I'm traveling to Israel for an entire month next week, so maybe I can find something there? I'm totally stuck on what to get him.
 

EDIT: I also thought of maybe getting him something car related, like maybe a car accessory since neither of us have our licenses and spend money seeing each other. We're both working on it and hope to have our licenses and a car by the summer.     Hey. Added you. Let me know when you'd like me to come over.      I'll add you as soon as I can.

[Rant] The end of my first love: a one sided relationship *Warning: very long ;)*  It's been 10 days since the relationship officially ended. We met when I was a high school freshman and he was a sophomore. Me being a complete tomboy and only having friendships with guys never had a real crush before. When I saw him my first thought was, ""Wow, he's really cute. ""WTF WAS I THINKING? I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT GUYS THAT WAY."" I was the one that made fun of all my friends who obsessed over boys. I wasn't going to be that girl.

I failed. Later that night I friended him on Facebook. He accepted and we constantly chatted for weeks and weeks. I didn't like him at the time. His good friend told me he liked me and that absolutely shocked me. It was the first time I knew of a guy liking me. Naturally, I started liking him back. Once I got the balls to do something about my feelings, it was too late. He stopped liking me and got a girlfriend. She was tall and cute. I fucking hated that bitch.

We stayed good friends, though. I introduced him to a lot of people including my best guy friend (a huge mistake since this friend of mine introduce him to his next girlfriend). He eventually broke up with his girlfriend and I had high hopes for myself, but refused to let anyone know that I still liked him, including he, himself. He jokingly asked me out constantly to which I obviously responded, ""no, fuck off"" even though I liked him. He continued flirting with me.

The summer of my sophomore year, everything changed. This boy changed me. We went to see Guardians of the Galaxy (I know, super romantic) along with another guy friend. My crush and I ended up cuddling and he ended up feeling me up amongst other things (yes, the other friend was sitting next to us in the theater, BUT HE WAS WATCHING THE MOVIE AND WAS NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO US). This was, again, a first for me. 

Two days later he asked another girl out. **Two fucking days after he took advantage of me.** All of my friends were so happy for the two of them. She was ""pretty, nice and all around perfect."" I was beyond depressed.

It was hard being in the same friend group as the two of them and **extremely hard** ignoring the boy when he sent me snapchats jokingly flirting with me while in a relationship. A little over a month after they got together, I was asked out by one of my best friends. I accepted. We lasted for 3 months until I ended things due to me still having feelings for this other boy and failing to put in effort into the relationship.

One night my crush and I were messaging and he told me that he was thinking of breaking up with this girl. I was confused. He said she was too immature for him and wanted to fuck around with other girls. I should've ended the conversation there, but I didn't. I was dumb and continued talking to him. After all, he was my good friend.

I invited him to my sister's engagement party. He told me how pretty I looked and complimented me over and over. Later after the party, we all went to my friend's house and watched a movie. During the movie, the boy sat me on his lap, unzipped the back of my dress and gave me a back massage. Yes, he still had a girlfriend. Yes, I'm a fucking idiot and a bitch.

The night they broke up, he came over to my house to tutor me in math. He wasn't really helpful due to his tears smudging the paper and him not concentrating at all. I decided that we should just stop with math and go play some video games. After 20 minutes his ride came. Before walking him to the door, he kissed me. He left.

He messaged me immediately after saying that I can't tell a soul. I told him I wouldn't, which was complete bullshit. He told me he wasn't ready for a girlfriend yet, but wanted to be FWB. I freaked out at him and refused. He kept insisting. I stopped talking to him. 

One night I got stuck at his house with a bunch of my friends. He and I were still fighting. He decided to be funny and had us watch Guardians of the Galaxy. All of my friends knew what happened the night we saw it in theaters and thought it was hilarious that he did this. I was on the verge of tears. I tried avoiding and ignoring him for the rest of the night, but he came under my blanket on the floor and apologized. I forgave him and we started making out under the blanket. Once everyone fell asleep, he took me to his garage, laid me down on his workout bench, and started feeling me up ~~and eventually fingering me~~. Another first. Afterward, he asked me to give him a blowjob. I refused.

The day after, he was pissed at me for not sucking his dick. He complained about his blue balls and how much pain he was in. I felt terrible. He said he regretted doing what we did in his garage and that I can't tell anyone. I was so hurt. I loved him.

I found out that my crush was talking to our guy friends about getting back together with his ex-girlfriend and how he never stopped loving her. I was distraught. I realized I was compl",1
subject8657," Request: What are some steps that I can take to control my compulsion to B P?  I am currently overweight, and I have been most of my life, but I've made a lot of progress this year, coming from being well into morbidly obese. I do a good job of eating   exercising, and I lose at a healthy rate. I get a little overwhelmed by restricting calories, but I don't think I need help for that.

When I have cheat days, I easily eat back that entire week's deficit. I purge it all by vomiting, but I know that doesn't really get rid of it. I figure I can continue eating. I have been feeling for so long that this is fine, because it's only once a month, as opposed to more than ten times a day like I was doing before I got on track. But yesterday I genuinely set out to eat moderately for a cheat day, but I found myself compulsively buying more junk food than I actually even wanted, and purging all of it. I felt like I didn't even have a choice.

I have a therapist, and I know she's not the most productive one around, but I'm currently in crisis with depression and anxiety and it's really not a good time to go shopping. I might go on Prozac soon, and I need to at least have someone familiar to see every week while I'm adjusting. I think I'll look for someone new if I get through all of this without a hospitalization. 

But for now, I'd like to know if anyone has any advice for how to talk to her, and what I could expect in return. I don't think I'll ever fully recover, but I want to take steps to feeling more in control and more capable of making the decision not to B P. Has anyone successfully come back from a very compulsive habit? What were the first things you did to break the cycle?

I am motivated to push myself, but that's offset by my low expectations that I'll ever be normative with food. I really want to just focus on not doing what I'm doing anymore. I want to be able to eat off-program every few weeks without binging. And I hate, hate, hate purging so much. It feels like death. How do I do this, with my therapist's help?  Request: How to stop the nosedive that my relapse is taking  Hey,

I've (19/m) been diagnosed with Anorexia for 4.5 years now, and it's been about two years since I sort of recovered-but-didn't-really from when I was at my worst, so to speak. Came out of hospital, vowed to never let it happen again (.. sort of) and maintained a not really super high weight. I mean all I really felt like I did was maintain my weight enough so I would lose all attention from doctors and such, which worked, but it didn't really solve anything, just stick it in the background.

So now, two years later I've started at a new college and completely relapsed. I've had bouts where I have relapsed but it's never been this bad/lasted this long so far. I think what kind of sparked it is: being surrounded by all these new people and struggling to make friends in the first two weeks by feeling like a complete outsider confirmed my feeling of a lack of identity. So I went back to something I knew, and that could stand in for it - except this time the mentality is not as clear cut and it just makes everything feel so much awful as I'm objectively aware of what's at risk now compared to the last time.

So now I'm here (if any of that even made sense), right on the verge of wrecking everything I worked for in the past two years and I just.. don't care. I should, but I don't, and I'm at a loss (so is my therapist..)

It's like I faked my way through the past two years without actually solving anything at all (something that my therapist can't seem to understand when I try to be honest)

Erm, to finish (wow this seems long) - does anyone have any.. I don't know, advice? I guess, on where to go from here (where I'm pretty much alone support wise. Well, I have my therapist but he's .. well, he can shove it sometimes).
  Request: help with an out of town friend  We are a small group of friends and one girl moved away a couple of years ago to a city 5+ hours away. Independently, three of us have noticed signals pointing to an eating disorder, ranging from downy body hair a period of time ago, an obsession with food, and recently, very restricted eating on the few occasions we have eaten together, but because we only see her occasionally, it is hard to tell if she has an eating disorder. 

Three of us are going to visit in a few weeks, and would like some advice on how to proceed if we keep noticing signs, or what else we should look for. We will be staying at her place. We don't know her friends in the new city, and have only briefly met her new boyfriend. We are comfortable speaking to her parents or brother   wife, who live in the same city as us and we know them well. They see her more often than we do.

Tldr; friend lives in another city and we suspect an eating disorder. What should we do on an upcoming visit to either find out more or what should we do if we get enough confirmation to be very concerned?  Request: Does anyone work in the health field?  
I'm not sure of the demographics of our subreddit but I was curious to see if anyone works in the health field? Nursing? Community Health? Nutrition? Mental Health?

I am about to graduate with a Bachelor's of Science in Nutrition degree with a concentration in Dietetics. My route would be to become a Registered Dietician.

To sum up a lifetime of information in a short sentence, the decision to be a RD (registered dietician) was made at a different time in my life. I thought I was....better.

I feel deflated. I wanted to become a RD when I was more ""recovered"". I thought I WANT TO HELP PEOPLE FEEL BETTER! OMG FOOD IS AWESOME AND EVERYONE SHOULD FEEL THIS HEALTHY! OMG RAINBOWS AND SUNSHINE AND UNICORNS AND AVOCADOS!

Now I have a dark cloud over me. I think I eat pretty well? I still restrict...but I don't know. My mind is all over the place. I'm burnt out from school and everything that has to do with food. I have thought about food for the past decade because of my eating disorder. Now I have academically studied food/nutrition/health/physiology day in and day out for the past 3 years. Straight A's. Study study study.

Now I feel like my restricting patterns are covered and intertwined with piles of justifications and reasons I feed myself. The worst part is, I don't feel like helping people anymore in that way. Mostly because no one really cares WHY they should eat healthy. They just want me to tell them the easiest way to lose weight.

I'm rambling. Does anyone work in the health field? Do you feel like a hypocrite?

[Addressing Bulimia](http://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/24g5vt/request_how_to_begin_addressing_bulimia/)  Navigating Weight Loss After an Eating Disorder. -Not a perfect article, but a beginning.    Request: It's Getting Worse, thoughts of purging  I feel like I'm slipping further into the eating disorder abyss these days. I posted on this subreddit over the summer, and didn't get much feedback, but I'm hoping for more guidance this time.

My boyfriend gave me an ultimatum this summer to see a doctor about my bad body image and eating thoughts. I went to the doctor and got told I had BDD, and ""disordered eating"" leaning on the side of EDNOS. They told me to take a day off of work each week (I work 7 days a week) but I can't afford that and they prescribed me meds. I took them for a while but really didn't think they were helping.

Lately the thoughts are worse than ever before. This all started while I was on a weight loss journey, which kind of became an obsession. I injured myself overdoing it with the exercise (I ran a half marathon, then went back to work, worked out during the week and then ran a 5k in the rain that weekend) and I was just on a work trip - which means largely unhealthy eating - and I've not only stalled in my weight loss, but I've gained.

It's the gain and the fear of gain that's impacting me. I'm petrified to wake up and see that my double chin's come back. I'm tired of being overweight.

But now...on to why I'm posting. While I had thought about throwing up and starving, I had never acted upon it until now. It happened during my work trip. I was eating with a group at a Mexican restaurant there, and I overdid it. I basically binged. And had a margarita - a strong one. During my tipsy state I made myself throw up, but didn't push it too much. 

I told my boyfriend and he's terrified. I've thought about doing it again, but haven't acted upon it. I've even considering exercising with my injury against doctors orders, so I don't gain weight. Work's been a million times stressful lately and I've been stress eating and binging as well.

What do I do? 

How do I get back on track? 

How do I keep myself from wanting to throw up?  Request: Anxiety, depression, bulimia, and saying the wrong thing to my ex, nipping BN before it gets worse.  
I have anxiety, depression, and bulimia. I'm a guy. Four years ago I met my (now ex) gf and she had bulimia. I loved her so much, I still do. She said I helped her get better just by loving her. We broke up after three years  and the last thing I said to her was the nastiest thing I ever said to anyone, and about her bulimia. That comment was not me, and it sent me spiraling down into a sea of anxiety of depression. I want to tell her I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. She is happy now and that's great. 

I've always been underweight and I would eat and eat to gain weight but it is hard gaining weight for me. One day a few weeks ago I found myself sick to the stomach and needed to get rid of the feeling. So I did. Ever since I've been binging and purging. I'm not sure if it's karma or what. I think about that comment all the time. We had such a good relationship and her last memory of me is an evil one. 

I have suicidal thoughts and daydream about dying. I love her so much and I wish she would know how much she means to me. It's been like a month and I need to stop this before it get's worse. I don't know what to do, where to start. I'm alone and hide all day. I want to drop out of school. Idk what to do.

How do I tell her I'm sorry?

How do I get out of bulimia?  Request: Vyvanse for BED/Binge Purge: Anyone With Experience?  I've struggled with B/P and BED for several years, tried lots of therapists, meditation, hypnotherapy, anti depressants, clonazepam for anxiety. etc. and have done better or worse depending on whats going on in my life but have never really been able to complete recover. I started researching drugs for Bulimia and BED and other than anti-depressants there is nothing FDA approved. Since I've tried those and they didn't work, and they can make you gain weight, I didn't want to try those again. I considered Topimax, but I have a girl friend on it and she told me of horrible side effects and having a hard time focusing. Not really an option for me since I need to be on point for work. Anyways, I came across a few studies on Vyvanse, an ADHD drug, that is trying to get FDA approval right now for BED. I talked to my doctor about it, she had never heard of it being used for ED so she researched it and agreed to try it on one condition. She said I had to promise no purging (vomit type not exercise) as vomiting could give me seizures, which is why it was tested on BED and not bulimics. Well seizures are pretty scary... enough to get me on-board with no purging and knowing if I don't binge then I don't purge. She started me on 20 mg/day for the first week and then moved me to 40 mg. Its been 3 weeks and I haven't had one binging episode yet!!!! This is the longest I've gone in...well... forever it seems.

So my question to the group. There isn't a lot of information on how to use Vyvanse... I'm curious if anyone else has tried it? If so, how long did you take it for? Did you try stopping it and if so did your binging come back? Do you take it every day? My hope is Vyvanse will be enough to break the ""habit"" part of my ED while my therapy works on the emotional part.
  Request: Roommate concern, bulimia  My roommate is a friend from work and we started living together 2 months ago. I have noticed she throws up her food but does things like leave the toilet seat up, almost to be obvious, I dont know. I have been ignoring it. 

Last night I walked into the bathroom and saw her making herself throw up. She did not see me. I dont know what to do. It is upsetting because I do care for her, but I dont know how much to get into her business. 

Do i continue to ignore? Please help.  Request: Quitting Calorie Counting/Exchanges/Measuring Food Cold Turkey...good idea? Ways to manage anxiety, intuitive eating, etc?  
Long story short, I've been recovered from AN for some time and am at a healthy weight. However, for the longest time, I still used a food scale religiously and kept a food journal/app (flipped between a few methods). 

As of late due to stress and the fact that I am still at this whole religious tracking, I've had issues binging off an on for the past few months. Last nights basically occurred because I wanted a healthy food item, was hungry for 2, but only had ""allowance"" for one. I ate one serving...then another...then broke out some other food and went at it. It hit me right after it happened. 

I now binge off and on when anything is off limits. I also binge when I figure out what I'm eating for the next meal (really bad at night trying to figure out what to eat for breakfast).

So...as I'm writing this, I literally just threw out my food scale(...s-yes its sad). I now know that I'm going to be anxious pretty much 24/7 for the next few weeks, but I tried weening off of counting in the past and it never worked. The second I got stressed I'd regress..I'm kind of an all or nothing person, so I'm going to try it this way.

Any tips on how to manage anxiety? Intuitive eating? Making sure I'm still doing okay health wise (I just weigh myself 1x a week)?     Possibly helpful posts:

  Request: Request for advice on how to talk to roommate/best friend about recent habits?  My friend, who in recent months has become my roommate, struggles with an ED. Before moving in together, we talked very often but of course I could only know what she told me over the phone. Although she never specifically told me that she has an ED, she has often talked about her food issues and stress surrounding them, and although I am not sure how to describe it, but it is very clear between the two of us that I am aware of it. 

However, despite me knowing about her issues and being highly concerned for her well being all the time, I know it is not my place to comment on her habits or to tell her what to do in anyway. This is mostly due to the fact that I know her mother is not supportive of the notion of her having any kind of issue, and often will stress her out by forcing her into eating, and that she also regularly would see a therapist, although honestly I have my doubts about her mentioning anything food related to her. During this time I knew not to be the person to bring anything related up, as again, she has enough people doing that and I am her friend, not her therapist and I do not want to become another source of stress to her or have her distrust me in anyway. She has made it very clear that she does not wish to talk about it. 

Coming to now, however, I am concerned enough to want to break my silence. As Ive said, we now live together and spend a large percentage of our time together. For a while she was doing great, without her mother there to stress her out and without anything else stressful in her life it was ok. Recently though this has changed, and I have picked up that she had not been eating well for a couple of days, and now I am certain that besides an unnatural amount of water she has not eaten anything in more than a couple of days. 

I am at a loss for what to do, as I know that I cannot make her do anything, but I dont know if it is smarter or safer to her health for me to tell her my observations or not to. On one hand I dont want her to continue this of course, because she is very obviously not feeling well and I am scared for anything more serious happening to her because of this, but on the other I do not want to break her trust or cause her to become anymore stressed out due by me talking to her. Im just at a total loss for what to do or say reddit, I just want her to be ok again ):  Request: Think girl I am dating has an ED. If so, ow do I approach her about it?  I've recently started dating this girl who I am pretty into, and things seem to be getting serious. Her eating habits do concern me though and I'm looking to find out if she does in fact have an ED, and how I should approach her about my concerns.

For starters, she does have celiac, which she was diagnosed with about a year ago; she also chooses to be vegetarian. Because of these two things she is obviously very limited in what she can eat. She is not visibly underweight to the point where its noticeable in everyday interaction, but from the chart in the side-bar, and judging by what shes told me her height/weight are, she definitely may be underweight. She admits to not eating much at all and says that she is tired of the foods she is able to eat; when I asked her what she enjoys she says she eats marshmallows and chocolate chips and drinks a lot of lattes/Espresso. 

I have hung out with her about 5 times, some of which were for 8+ hours and during that time she has only drank coffee/water. I've had to eat multiple times during these times to keep from getting HANGRY, as I put it. She has also told me that she ate a specific number of calories for a period of time that I know to be well below what is healthy; she says she did this because friend told her it was okay/healthy.

Do you guys think she has an ED judging from this info?

 How do I bring it up without hurting/offending her? 

I take my personal health really seriously, and even though I haven't known her long it is difficult to see someone seem to be so uninterested in/struggle with food. Thanks in advance guys.
  Started recovery and noticing pains in my body. What should I do?  I've been bulimic for 8 years and a month into my recovery. After looking through some of the medical effects of bulimia, I've only just started to realise that the pains I've been having are likely to be related to my eating disorder. I get very severe stomach pains I can barely talk through and used to, very naively, blame it on hunger pains or too much food. I've recently started to have chest pains as well which got quite bad last night. I'm not 100% sure this is due to my bulimia but now I'm getting worried. I've read so many stories of the problems people have had because of their disorder and not sure what step I should take now. I'm away from home and not registered which any doctors in my area. I have tried calling the local doctors but they say that they're full. I was considering going to A E (emergency room) but how urgent do you think this is? I feel like I'm overreacting slightly and not sure what tests they can actually do or whether they'd do anything once I'm there.

There is also the choice of calling the NHS helpline but it's expensive and not sure how much they'll be able to help.  Survey: Anonymous ED survey, Chance to share your story if you'd like  

I would like to collect anonymous feedback from other eating disorder sufferers for a presentation I am doing on EDs in my college Psychology course. I have set up a survey online which keeps all submissions anonymous (to me, and thus to everyone else), in the hope that I can shed light on the individual struggle. I want to keep my presentation from being clinical and impersonal while still respecting the privacy rights of sufferers.

I greatly appreciate all your help. Thanks.
  Request: Advice on helping girlfriend with EDNOS  First, thank you to anyone for your time and comments on this thread. Secondly, please forgive me if in my attempt to speak knowledgably, I use any wrong wording or misinformation. Im here for help and not to offend anyone.

My girlfriend and I have a fantastic relationship. Theres not a thing about her I would change, except, this one thing. Shes struggled with binge eating and purging for a long time now. This all pre-dates our relationship. Earlier in our relationship, I addressed it. It was obvious that she was sneaking off after meals. Sometimes, Id find the underside of the toilette seat to have stained or still wet vomit.

We had a very open, though hard conversation about her addiction. Shes gone through therapy and has done a 30 day inpatient rehab. Shes explained to me that her addition is not fueled by a body image issue, but rather its a control issue. Also, weve talked about the sugar rushes she experiences from carbs and junk food and enjoying that feeling. Im not certain, but I believe shes bingeing and purging about every 4-5 days.

I know that I cant be her white knight. I cant fix this for her. Ive dated a person with an eating disorder before, and its a hard battle. And its a battle that cant be fought by anyone other than the person suffering.

Im having a hard time with it, because while shes open to talking to me when I have questions, its an incredibly hard conversation to start. I know shes ashamed and embarrassed by it, so having starting a conversation about not wanting to be finding vomit stained toilets anymore is difficult.

I know I cant fix this, but I can support her with every fiber of my body. Im looking for any advice for being in a relationship with a person thats suffering; if there are any communication tips, things to say and not say. I dont want to make her uncomfortable or make her feel bad. Shes stopped going to therapy within the last 3 months, and I feel like maybe she needs to keep trying. How do I suggest that?

Search your area and you should be able to find some sort of equine therapy available near you.  Equine Therapy for Eating Disorders    Request: Remembering that I'm a binge eater..  I know I have BED, and I have had for the past couple of years now. The past few months have been quite good, in that I have discovered a way that works for me in getting over the disorder, and whilst I still have a way to go in overcoming it completely, I've definitely made progress. My question is about reminding myself about it. For example, when I haven't binged in about a month or so, I feel so great and happy and back to my normal self that I forget I have this unhealthy relationship with food, and allow myself to eat something I wouldn't normally. This is the trigger, and it then happens all over again. When I'm feeling so good, and I try to remind myself that I'm a recovering binger, I don't believe myself. I become schizophrenic and talk myself out of the fact that I need to be careful with food. But once I have that bad food which I know I shouldn't, I go on a 2 day binge and make myself completely sick and hate myself for it. only THEN do I remember, and believe the rational me, that I am a recovering food addict.

How do you guys remind yourself after extended periods of time NOT to have that food in case it starts another vicious cycle? When you've come such a long way and it feels like that part of your past never existed, how do you remind yourself that it did, and that it'll never be the same for you as it is with other people who haven't suffered the disorder??
  Request: Do I have an eating disorder, anorexia, or just bad habits?  Do I have an eating disorder

I'm really confused right now about whether I have an eating disorder.

 I'm a 21 year-old, 5-10 male and am severely underweight. When I say that I mean I want to make it clear that severely means really, really, severely. I would only be at the correct weight, according to my doctor, if I would a lot shorter and female. When I used one of those BMI scanners in health class, it just read ""error"", though at the time I thought that meant I was in really good shape.

Anyway, I eat 1-1.5 meals a day plus a snack or two. My meals are usually small compared to other people since I'm rarely hungry and get full easily. 

I had previously never worried about this, I was always underweight for my height, but it hasn't really affected my life as far as I can tell. I always eat when I'm hungry and eat till I'm full. In fact, sometimes I eat until I'm uncomfortably full. 

What brought on my concern is that I recently spent 5 days at the hospital. I was incredibly sick, and couldn't hold down and food or liquid and had to go to the hospital to avoid dehydrating. At first the doctors thought I had a flu or something, but by the 2nd day 4 out of 5 times I was visited by a doctor it was a psychiatrist, they were weighing my food before and after I ate and on the 4th day they told me they thought I might be anorexic. I told them that I wasn't, that I wanted to gain weight, but had a really hard time doing it. 

They didn't really listen to me and kept asking me over and over about if I skipped meals, and how I personally felt bout my weight, I told them I didn't skip meals and that I wanted to gain weight. At first they didn't believe me, then they said I might have anorexia without realizing it.


I'm out of the hospital now, but they want me to see a psychiatrist and a therapist about whether I have an eating disorder or not. They said my health could be in serious jeopardy. I guess what I'm trying to figure out is whether or not I actually have an eating disorder, and should see the doctors (an important note is that I'm a broke college student with no health insurance and only want to take this route if I'm really in danger) or if I just have bad eating habits and should maybe work to improve my diet. 

Important things I want to reiterate are that I never don't eat on purpose, except sometimes if I'm feeling really depressed, but that doesn't happen too often, and that I feel like my health is fine, in fact I play tennis and teach it to kids over the summer.

I just want someone to tell me whether I have an eating disorder or just bad eating habits? 

I've never really thought about this before, but the doctors at the hospital really scared and confused me. They even told my parents that they think I have an eating disorder and now my parents won't stop bugging me about it.  I really need an answer.  Request: Need immediate help for GF who is having a breakdown  
Not going to get into a long description of what's going on, but my GF is having a complete breakdown (by her own admission) and says she needs to talk to someone immediately. The phone numbers for NEDA and ANAD are not open on the weekend.

She is self-harming. Her mind is on overdrive with thoughts of self-hate, abuse, body-shaming, ""not deserving food/love"", etc.

She has been suffering from ED for years, but it has been extremely bad for about a year and half. She went into an outpatient facility about 8 months but broke away from guidelines while there and quickly turned to old habits after leaving. She was seeing a therapist who dropped her a couple months ago and she has stopped seeing her nutritionist.

She says she has no one to talk to about what she is going through, but she is at a breaking point and desperately needs to talk to someone.

We have very little money and she does not have insurance. I know she needs long-term help, but is there any outlet for her to reach out to today?  Request: How do I talk to my husband about my eating disorder - food addiction?  
I've been struggling with food addiction for several years. I have good years and bad years, good days and bad days. When we started dating I was in a good place, but now, after a couple years of marriage my monster is starting to emerge from its cave. I had been very good about healthy eating and regular exercise, but lately I can't get my shit together.

I tried to tell him a couple weeks ago, ""that I'm not just a girl struggling to lose weight, I have a real problem."" I'm not sure he really understands the extent of it, or thinks of it as a real disorder. His response was, ""ok."" 

Last night after dinner with a friend i stopped at two places on the way home for extra treats. I felt like shit about it, obviously, and this morning when he rolled over and put his arm around me I recoiled and said, ""please don't touch my stomach."" I DO NOT want to push him away, hide things from him, or withdraw into hiding as is bound to happen.

First, what do I say so that he truly understands that food addiction is a real, serious thing? 

Second, what kind of support is helpful from him? I don't know how to lean on someone for something that I've always kept fiercely private. I have no doubt that he will be supportive, but I don't think either of us know what that really means.

I've never sought counseling for this before, but I think it's time to do so. I cannot watch myself repeat cycles of massive weight gain and depression, and I cannot hide from my marriage because of my disorder.  Request: Eating Disorder Triggered Due to Ex's Comments  Two weeks ago my boyfriend of almost two years confessed he had been 'living a double life"" and was cheating with his ex-girlfriend (which was also his girlfriend - he had two girlfriends - me and her).
He told me he was in love with her and was breaking it off with me to be with her and her two children. He let me know all this via email.

His other girlfriend (she lives in another state) didn't know that he and I were still together - -- he told her that we had broke up in May --- which wasn't the case. I knew there was an problem due to the decrease of sex in our relationship - which I addressed with him and he stated it was due to him going through depression.

As someone who has been through depression off and on all my life - I tried to be understanding and backed off the issue for a while. Offering him advice, support and time.

Well, all that time he had been having sex with her - he was going back to his hometown every month -- which is 6 hrs from where we live to be with her - and do all the relationship/couple things I wanted to do with him - with her.

The issue is - even though I wasn't IN love - I loved him and cared about him a lot and also thought we had a great and supportive friendship aspect of our relationship. So, I feel betrayed and really hu",1

She's just turned 14 weeks :D    I needed to share this with someone!  I posted last week asking how to keep motivated with treatments, and this lovely CF community gave me some great bits of advice, and words of encouragement. As my partner (ex? still not sure) is currently abroad, there aren't many people in my life I feel I can share this with, so I wanted to tell you all. 

I have been 100% compliant with all of my treatments for nearly two weeks now. This is possibly the first time ever. I realise that, where other people have responsibilities to their job, or to their family etc, I have a responsibility to my health. When my relationship fell apart, I had a sudden realisation that I did not like myself - this lazy, irresponsible person. And if I didn't like that, why should he? I never want to be that person again.

I got up yesterday, and I wanted to do my treatments. I wanted to make my bed. I wanted to shower and brush my hair. I cried because it felt so freeing to actually *want* to do something. I saw a friend for dinner, and then I made plans to see her again next week. A month ago, I would have cancelled that dinner. Or I wouldn't have taken my enzymes, in case she saw them. But yesterday I took them and had them on the table so she could see. I've decided not to hate my CF anymore, I think.

I know it's early days, and I know there are going to be days when I get up, and I won't want to do treatments, because everyone has days like that. But I think that when that happens, I can push past that, and realise that I have to, there's no choice, really.

I'm not sure what the point of this post is, and I'm sorry for rambling, or if anyone felt like this was gloating - it isn't at all. For the first time in 22 years, I think I want to be in control of my CF, and not let my CF control me, and I really needed to share that with someone today.

I hope you're all well, and thank you for reading this.

She's just turned 14 weeks :D    I needed to share this with someone!  I posted last week asking how to keep motivated with treatments, and this lovely CF community gave me some great bits of advice, and words of encouragement. As my partner (ex? still not sure) is currently abroad, there aren't many people in my life I feel I can share this with, so I wanted to tell you all. 

I have been 100% compliant with all of my treatments for nearly two weeks now. This is possibly the first time ever. I realise that, where other people have responsibilities to their job, or to their family etc, I have a responsibility to my health. When my relationship fell apart, I had a sudden realisation that I did not like myself - this lazy, irresponsible person. And if I didn't like that, why should he? I never want to be that person again.

I got up yesterday, and I wanted to do my treatments. I wanted to make my bed. I wanted to shower and brush my hair. I cried because it felt so freeing to actually *want* to do something. I saw a friend for dinner, and then I made plans to see her again next week. A month ago, I would have cancelled that dinner. Or I wouldn't have taken my enzymes, in case she saw them. But yesterday I took them and had them on the table so she could see. I've decided not to hate my CF anymore, I think.

I know it's early days, and I know there are going to be days when I get up, and I won't want to do treatments, because everyone has days like that. But I think that when that happens, I can push past that, and realise that I have to, there's no choice, really.

I'm not sure what the point of this post is, and I'm sorry for rambling, or if anyone felt like this was gloating - it isn't at all. For the first time in 22 years, I think I want to be in control of my CF, and not let my CF control me, and I really needed to share that with someone today.

I hope you're all well, and thank you for reading this.

subject8986,"    I'm really curious why you had hallucinations. Did you have psychotic depression? Or was the seizure part of your diagnosis unrelated to depression? I know Lamictal is an antiseizure med which has helped with me the most (I don't have any psychotic symptoms though).     On a totally sad note about that, I once remember watching Animal Planet (I think) where someone disowned their poodle because it didn't match their new living room decor.     I'm obsessed with the marks your clothing left behind on your lower belly. Beautiful :)     My vagina just squeezed a little.     Nope. I don't find anything wrong with her glasses. I have glasses and it's certainly not fun to wear them in bed anyways... *if you know what I'm saying... these italics make me sound so creepy*.     It's funny how ambien does that. I can't imagine it working for someone because makes people like bricks after 30 minutes. Although I know someone with an ambien addiction who takes like 5 a day, I don't know how she does that. It was fun to take it but I wake up the next day with the phone having 40 minute conversations and things. Nothing too drastic.

I can imagine ADHD being a lot like mania in a way. Not in the hyperactivity per se, but with racing thoughts and impulsivity. I have ADHD and I think it's in my nature to be more impulsive but not for manic reasons. Adderall calmed me down a lot. It was perfect but I can't take it anymore because it made my heart rate too fast.     That's interesting. Have you tried other over the counter things such as Calcium and Magnesium? I've heard St Johns Wort could have a strong placebo effect. I wonder if that's not true, but something with subtler effects (such as SJW and magnesium) helps better for you.     Hm, I've never had disturbances (would it be like hallucinations?) but I deal with derealization / depersonalization every once in a while outside from panic. My boyfriend wanted to hospitalize me when he didn't know what it was but it's funny that something as simple as klonopin helped. Lamictal helped a lot with that too.     I became 88 pounds (being 5'4"") but now I'm 104. I'm doing much better. Before I was 88 I think I was like 110.     Why did you stop risperidone? What happened with your visual disturbances?

I'm glad celexa works for you. It does well with people, that and Lexapro. They're supposed to be very similar. I don't remember exactly why I got off of Lexapro but I took it two separate times so there must be a reason I went through withdrawal hell twice for it.     Yeah, this is the first time I haven't been on a combo. When I first started I was taking lots at once. Usually Lamictal + antidepressant + Buspar or Adderall + benzo. I liked to say I was taking an antidepressant, depressant, stimulant, and mood stabilizer because it just sounded funny like that. It's nice I suppose that I only have to take Lamictal right now, but it's not enough. Hopefully increasing in the future will help.

I'm happy to hear that you're okay with realizing you'll be on antidepressants for the rest of your life. I think me too. It's only really helped.      I used to have a dream of taking pictures for a living. Now I kind of want to paint but not really, I just say it. Translating emotion visually is so great. I once had a bad grade in a photo class and never wanted to take photos again. That stuff doesn't matter anymore. It's very nice to know someone who was suicidal still takes nat geo photos. That was my goal once, to go into the wild and take photos, that sort of thing. That dream job sort of thing. I forgot about it. Thank you.     I am also 19 and have an interest in indirect suicide. Very different from you, though. Sorry to add in some bullshit diagnosis but being bipolar with rapid cycling can make people feel this way. The death obsession with depression and the energy to do it with mania. But anyways, I don't think death will help. It just numbs you. Being numb is so addicting. I bet especially so with your lifestyle... craving that feeling of finally feeling numb. It's like finding peace but much more tragic. I hope these other people's words help. I just understand that indirect suicide thing, I've never been suicidal but I've not wanted to live plenty of times. Like, eh fuck eating, too much work to keep myself in this condition. I'm not trying to say you'll be fixed one day but I think one day you'll find this thing where you'll like a thing. I don't know what thing. I'm obsessed with kittens and I don't have one but they keep me going. It's fucking stupid but they saved me and I can save a kitten too which is pretty cool. One day.     I do this when I've been alone for a few hours, to the point of breaking down crying. I'm definitely not trying to 1up you, saying I have it worse at all. But just a small thing, I have been getting better. My boyfriend was sick and house sitting his moms place (we have a dog that can't come) so I went and slept the night. I had no one and I actually enjoyed myself. I also have driving anxiety and she lives in a hilly area with small streets. One year ago I couldn't have done this. Being alone for 5 minutes made me sad (boyfriend pooping for instance??) a year ago. I could not imagine being alone for a few days. And I have complete social anxiety to almost agoraphobia. Scumbag brain at it's worst (for me).     This is good. I'm in the middle of college and my (abnormal) psychology professor said that it's okay to take school slowly. She has a PhD so it's nice to get the validation. She said she believed in me getting a PhD, but not now. That was last year. I need something like this. I'm on break from school, no job, so I'm getting no external validation (money or grades) to know how well I'm doing. Anyone saying anything I'm doing fine is lying to me. 

Watching things like Intervention I say things like, Oh My God these people need immediate help. People say, No I need my daughter! And not even having a child I feel so funny saying these people need help, and I can't even take a month off of self care. Whether in the hospital, whatever. I don't need that now, I'm a year past that point, but really... It's extremely hard to judge not seeing how bad your situation is from your perspective. This is a great little comic.     I've been sleeping 14 hours, and then naps in between. I took 2 naps today outside of the sleep. Before being medicated, I would be so stressed I would sleep because it's like finally being able to take a break. It must be part of the relief of suicide. I'm not suicidal but goddamn I need sleep. Which makes me not eat and made me 88 pounds but fuck it, maybe it's all a slow death. I'm wondering if it's related to compulsive overeating, but compulsive oversleeping. I'm bored, I sleep. I'm happy, I sleep. I'm anxious, I sleep. I'm nauseous, I sleep.     A few days ago I had a panic thing because I heard a song I listened to in middle school. It happens a lot from that time period, when my depression started. I think it's because its such a ""losing child innocence"" stage in my life. It sucked because I was about to get laid, and I did but it was probably a pity lay, since I haven't heard back from her. She was also a brand new 18 year old lesbian and I'm a 19 year old lezbo grandma (just kidding) but it's like, fuck this is supposed to be sexy. But all I did was cry. I can't smell and I've heard people find smells nostalgic. But there is something quite tragic in nostalgia. I never compare the word nostalgia to something that is happy. It's always a longing. And in depression, I do long.     I always thought it was interesting how death was connected to my depression. I always thought, I'm not suicidal but I certainly wouldn't mind if I died. Killing myself would take too much work and planning that I just don't have the energy to do. It might be a reason I had anorexia, because I would just not have the energy to feel myself (amongst other things). I always felt like the suicidal ones must be bipolar (or fast cycling).

I understand. I'm dealing with it by getting my dopamine hits. Small little doses of things that not necessarily bring me excitement (so hard), but just the little things that give me a little zap. It's how (recreational) drugs probably work. This would just be more ""natural"" and more fit to you. Hobbies are so hard to think of now, at least for me. I feel pressure to do well in a hobby. So things like reddit (obviously) help. Anything to get you high as long as it isn't directly damaging (things that'll get your adrenaline or endorphins up... unless it's exercise. But unhealthy sex, vomiting, drugs, although they help temporarily, don't really help in the end). 

With my own personality, it's the things that people make fun of that work for me. People say it's stupid to show a depression person a picture of a kitten, but I've always been an animal nerd since a tiny girl. I don't consider it a hobby, since animals don't judge. Perhaps find something like that. People often say charity helps with that but don't worry about that yet. But have that mindset in the back of your brain. 

Or stupid things like self help books even help. I love the DBT workbook (it's green). Different from CBT but it basically gives you lists you can do without judging you. 

You can have a ""fuck it, fuck life"" thing too, like.. ""fuck i'm going to run to the grocery store and not giving a shit"" helps. Like that same anger that comes from ""fuck life"" but different. The point isn't to make you happy at this point, but for little steps. 

I don't even know what I'm saying. I understand completely though. Someone out there is going through the same things, sometimes dealing with it worse. Wanting and asking for help is such an important step. Jeez, I keep sounding like some piece of shit article. I don't mean it like that. 

Just... it gets better. I feel better than I did 1 year ago. I can make it seem like that means it's been a year since I've only improved a little, but I'm changing my mindset to be like... I showered today, which is better than me not showering yesterday. Just small stuff.  What has been on your list of medications? I want to hear your (chemical) journey.  I'm sure a lot of us are here right in the middle of what I'm going through, which is finding the right meds. I thought it might be interesting to compare what we might be taking.

Me:

I got off Cymbalta because I slept all day.

I got off Wellbutrin because it made my anxiety worse (I also have GAD and panic disorder).

I got off Lexapro because it was expensive, sexual side effects, and I wasn't sure if it was working.

I got off of Paxil CR because I slept 14 hrs per day and spent that time with nightmares every day, but it did help with anxiety and depression.

I got off of Buspar because I don't think it did anything except when I stopped taking it my anxiety was bad.

I got off of Adderall because it made my heart rate consistently 120+ bpm. Another reason I stopped Wellbutrin. 

I took Strattera for like a month for some reason.

I've taken Lamictal and it helped with stopping my meltdowns becoming extreme. I'm on 200mg, increasing to 300mg and I've been on it for 2 years. I take xanax and klonopin on the side. I've just been switched to taking Paxil 5mg, from Paxil CR 25mg. I think it's mostly placebo.

I'm currently in the withdrawal stages of Paxil and I've been feeling bed bound, overwhelmed with everything from the physical side effects, and emotional, too. I seem to do really badly with withdrawals, from nausea and dizziness and brain zaps and panic and eventually vomiting from stress of nausea. I'm sick of always being in withdrawal, because otherwise I don't seem to get that sick. I know there are lots of medications that I haven't tried, but before I've at least I had an idea of what meds I should take next. I often suggest them to my doctors, since I've done my research. For example, when I went off of Adderall, I suggested Wellbutrin to help with the ADHD. The only thing that I know has worked is Lamictal, and only since I hit 200mg. CBT-based therapy helped around this time as well. I know many people have much longer lists than I do, and many more treatment options, and I'm curious about them all. What was your step after trying out SSRIs, for example? I'm especially curious about (atypical) antipsychotics and things of that sort.     I love how delicate your body is. So sexy. Also I think I have same/similar undies. Yay :D     I'd say the dykey bits :) There's a bit of a difference in the subreddits both link to on the sidebar!  The gorgeous Freja Beha       the movie ""our idiot brother"". ahh rashida jones in this is SO cute! i read recently that the stylist dressed her as a boy he would be attracted to.      I'll have to see about the leather, as someone said in this thread about cloth being more sanitary when it comes to multiple partners, being able to sanitize. We both love leather, so it'll be a hard decision. Or not. Maybe both will happen. :) If i do get cloth though, it won't be a cheap one. What you said makes a lot of sense. That leather one really is beautiful.

I have an njoy fun wand that I've used on him (gently!) and he took that pretty well... Although, it didn't go in much, I suppose he was more okay with the circumference... hm, I didn't really think about that until now.     Thanks! I love that purple one, although I think it would be too large for my boyfriend's first. Maybe just for myself when I get the money :P

It's not the g-spot I'm worried about, but general friction, and it doesn't seem to be because of lube for me, since even when I do use synthetic lube I still feel pain after a short while. It's very odd, I can do anal sex much more ""successfully"" than vaginal. 

Do you know if a low riding harness would add extra stimulation to the vulva? Since I do like pressure on the mound/lower tummy... I suppose things like this are for me to find out with my own body!

Anyways, thank you so much! I love the internet.     I appreciate you taking time out of class to write this! It definitely helps.

The cloth idea definitely sounds good, for cleaning reasons. I've seen some great looking cloth ones too. 

I don't necessarily need a sparkly dildo, just to explain how I want it in the general gist of things. :P

I always thought I wanted a double ended dildo, but I'm not sure anymore since my vagina gets overstimulated pretty easily. Is there a problem with that? I can imagine it might bother my urethra as well, since it would be in the middle of all the stimulation.      I suppose I was listing reasons to not have sex in the dark to make an orgy better. So, I listed the analogy to add to the confusion of protection.     i am proud to say that i am not into bestiality.      right now i'm writing on ambien with no glasses on so i might speak a little out of order but i have insomnimania so its ok. i mean like, let's say in a group of hot people, let's use the stupid rating system, of people from 8-10. of course you want to touch 9 and 10, but the 8s you're less likely to want to touch. maybe, to me, it feels like a high school dance? like.. ""id go out with those skaters, except that one"" but when it comes to orgies, you have to be like... the chance of you being with someone you don't want to be already messes the flow in your head. unless they're all identical twins. no one has the same amount of trust and know each other with everyone. oof. if you want, you can ask me specifically and i can respond better once I sleep.     oh. yeah. nitrous oxide, not those cute spindly things.      I'm not so into vibrators. Maybe I just need the whole shbang hitachi, but it's a little boring to me. maybe having to adjust, and not having it lost, and when is it time to stop using it, and i hope the dog doesn't get to it if it fell of the bed... (disclaimer: i have generalized anxiety :P) but even without those thoughts, it arouses me like 3 out of 10 at best.      Yeah, that wiring thing you described is great. It really is just as if touch has a different sensation. there can be ones that have no sharpness. It takes a pretty good understanding of how it works (which I don't have that well down) but being on the receiving end of it, I don't like any pain related. I had probes in v and ass and since so much surface area was being touched, it basically was a low gentle vibrator. Another cool thing is using props like wiring through the dom's body to a whip with metals inside, or vampire gloves... kissing is great too, touching tongues with that little tickle in between. also, the adrenaline of the entire experience. I don't think i could ever come to it, and maybe not have it be sexual but more sensual.      Protection, but someone once told me that there's also the one person in the group you most likely do not want to have sex with. That person that might be fuckable when you're drunk.      Haha, same with me except instead of pizza it was whippets so basically it was just a big strange movie. Then I went to the kitchen and got some snacks and went back in and wanted more whippets. This was the first time I did whippets and it's still my favorite little thing. I was naked though and I love being naked but it's more of one of those bachelor things where I poke my boobs while watching TV and not wearing undies so I can do push laundry day to another day and there's some background moans going on somewhere.      I agree. I think a lot of people see being able to be with a girl as an experience that will most likely be purely sexual and short-lived. It wasn't until I was fully aware that I was bisexual instead of wanting to ""experiment"" and letting myself check out girls and be open to be with a girl in a long term relationship that I loved to have sex with girls. Not to say I don't love casual sex with girls too. God I love fucking girls. This is fun to talk about. It makes me want to come out to the whole world. ""Here's your groceries"" ""Thanks I love girls"". Luckily the internet cares less about me saying things like that so boobies boobies boobies     Same! There's a part of me that might feel self conscious, but it doesn't explain not finding pleasure in receiving. I think for me it has to do with liking a broad surface area. I love grinding, for instance, and can / prefer to come with my undies still on (not having to do with the self consciousness). I get overstimulated much too quickly. One of the reasons I can last longer with anal sex than vaginal. Receiving oral is kind of boring to me though.     while there is an aspect of fearing of being a voyeur, i don't feel that way in threesomes. i guess it helps the small bit of exhibitionist in me, even though i'm usually the one to give. i suppose there's always room to touch... there's actually more available areas :P mouths, genitalia, holding hands, whatever. i've never been in a foursome, but to me it sounds like it might as well be an orgy or 2 couples having sex in the same room. totally personal preference though, since i'm not attracted by the idea of orgies or orgies i've been in the same room with. although, when i have been in a room where an orgy has been going on, i want to cling to my boyfriend even more, so maybe that's what the not feeling left out thing comes in. also sorry for the skipping around of this, ambien writing..!     you're focused on the dynamics of things, which is fine when there's someone who clearly knows what they're doing / are experienced / are a good top. that's ""easier"", at least. i've been in ones where it's basically 2 girls pleasing the guy, and the encounter was all very casual. it was good but afterwards it's like, eh i could've done without it. recently i've been doing ones where it's mostly like me and a girl playing, and i'm also paying attention to my boyfriend, but the 3rd is more like a toy. this is important to me since i'm more on the lesbian side of the spectrum at the moment. it was also not sex based, but like... cuddling extreme, where there was no pressure for orgasm. of course, the individuals is what makes the dynamic work, even when its 2 people. it's just more to think about with 3 people. i don't think it has to do with jealousy (and i can be jealous, just not in 3somes i suppose). i think there's more pressure to ""perform"" in general.     I'll keep all of those in mind, especially the first one. I haven't even thought of that (mixing and matching). There's so many options... 

I thought, well of course I want high quality! But realized my boyfriend might not like it at all. As with all sex toys, I suppose. 

I'm definitely going to a store after all of this browsing. I don't think I can tell well enough what is considered high quality.     That position is great if you need a large surface area, which sounds like what your friend is looking for, unless it really is just the texture. I'm similar in that I need a large surface area, and I love being on top (physically, not mentally). I masturbated while grinding on pillows, so I find that position to be the easiest to come to. Another good one is grinding against the partner's thigh, or that position which is grinding against the pubic bone which can be done without internal stimulation if that can be uncomfortable.  I'm buying a strap-on for the first time and need advice!  So, for my birthday (in March), my boyfriend is going to buy me a strap-on for me to use on him (and the ladies I get to fuck every once in a while!) (which happened last night btw I'm happy for getting laid, A+).

I'm trying to research them but I have no idea where to start, and thought I'd ask my fellow redditors. Are there any cult brands that I should know about (like njoy toys)? I'm a small/thin girl, is there a specific thickness of harness that is known to be more comfortable? What about harness materials? 

For the guys, especially the hetero ones: is there anything you can add about your experience with them? My boyfriend likes prostate stimulation but not penetration. We have an aneros but find that fingers work nicer. Is an extra small dildo helpful? Is one that gives a bend nicer? What would seem the least intimidating?

Some things I've got down is that I wouldn't like it to look realistic in terms of color and details and would love a pink girly glittery cock with hearts and stars and rainbows, at least for now.

Help!     i say either a very rich/dark red or brunette, i think too bright of red or too dark of black will make complexions look worse. not absolutely sure though! but i'm sure you can pull a lot off, the haircut suggestion above sounds great.     Honestly, try Kewpie mayo. Mentioned a few times here. It makes a world of a difference.     Would it be like itadakimasu?      Growing up with only Kewpie mayo, regular mayo disgusts me! Thank god I live by a Japanese market. It's much smoother and creamier than other mayo. Regular mayo is like Kraft cheese next to Kewpie.

Also... thanks for the recipe, OP. Simple recipes of things I already have is one of the greatest feelings. Makes me feel like my kitchen is well stocked even with an empty fridge.     this made me excited :) i saw your boys undies post the other day and went off to go look for some. i love boys undies.     There are some varying definitions, like the person not being able to stay at least 85% of their ideal body weight, and the refusal to gain. There's also the difference between Anorexia Nervosa and anorexia, which is just about a loss of appetite. They used the term very casually which is upsetting for an article that is trying to convey an accurate measurement of what ""normal"" is.     I'm in that situation right now. I love my boyfriend, but I'm also free to explore girls while he stays monogamous to me (by both our choices). There are plenty of girls out there who are willing to fulfill your girly-needs. For me, one of the top priorities in being with a girl is someone who is okay with me being with a man. This girl doesn't sound like the greatest addition to your relationship. If she already isn't okay with it, I'd be worried she would be jealous in the future, so you have to be very careful if you do plan on moving forward with her, and she gives the OK for some reason. My personal advice would be to move on, though.      i agree, though... the undies look so soft. cuddling you would be like hugging a kitten with hearts all over it while eating a cupcake, i think!     i have scars in the same area. it was surprising to see.

you're beautiful 3  One of these things is not like the others       i don't think she's ""ruined"", but since plastic surgery often has similar results (noses end up looking similar, etc), i'm not sure i could recognize if i saw her in public. she just blends in more.      are you... serious?      i have that color right now, different answer. i'm in the process of going white, but to take a break in between bleachings, i went a light pink. so the bleach is yellow, and ""cotton candy pink"" in manic panic mixed in with conditioner works. i also didnt wash my hair for a few days before the dye, so it rinsed out quickly... but its a very easy color to maintain otherwise, for a light color. mostly because you don't have to worry about toning.     this. my back hurts just looking at it.      thank you! she's such a gorgeous     [portia de rossi!](http://www4.images.coolspotters.com/photos/1380/portia-de-rossi-and-iggy-pop-lust-for-life-t-shirt-gallery.jpg)

[:) :P](http://i.imgur.com/ZEmzV.gif)     you two are so cute!! lovely     i'm not sure what a katniss braid is, sorry!      on another note about bisexuals being open. i think it might be related to being open about sexuality in general. for instance and with great generalization, a closeted person will most likely want to be in a long term, monogamous relationship for the image, security, etc. whereas coming out has fears on its own, so it might be easier to know what you want/ask for in terms of being poly, kinks, whatever.      well helloooo there... :P

you have awesome morning hair!

[this is also a nice little website with a similar feel to this thread](http://lesbianswholooklikeumlesbians.tumblr.com/)     the worst was the poop diapers stored in the bath :( i had to stop watching     i recently heard a guy in the background giving a suggestion or something. i think they forgot to edit it out. i died.     i'm exactly the same! i'm in a very serious relationship with a man, but only get off to girls. hetero porn is such a turn off for me... i don't think i've watched it in years, maybe accidentally. i'm guessing a lot of it has to do with how guys are portrayed in porn, too. it's often kind of... greasy (if i remember correctly). it might also be that i'm satisfied with the man cravings... but not the girls! i think i'm obsessed with girls. i think we all are.... but... augh :)     I thought that was great. I'm not blind, but I've never been able to smell. I loved the image of the lady whose head is a flower, and I didn't realize it related to my lack of smell until I showed it to my boyfriend. It helped me understand why someone would like to wear perfume, in a visual image, instead of just saying ""oh, it smells good"".      your excited response made me watch it. this, and i like princesses and jellyfish... i've been watching this on hulu since you posted. i'm about halfway done. i'm not even that big of an anime fan either. thank you!     what does make character design for you, then?      i understand that feeling, being (half) asian, and young. but it's totally about your self esteem. any girl could say that a guy is flirting with her just to bang her, etc.      There was also a tutorial around Halloween around here using jello inside straws to make jello-worms and they said they ran the straws under hot water for a little bit and they slid out.     It depends on what kind of art. I've noticed younger artists (probably a background in illustration) have cheaper art, ~$300. I like Gallery WWA in Culver City, they had a little back room filled with art when I went which I'm sure is still there.     stress/weight loss can do this as well. the hair cycles every 3 months, so if your stress was from 3 months ago, this sounds right. you could be stress-free now, but your hair is still 3 months behind.     i was thinking omurice (omlette-rice), as well.     kcgjlc;iug

kick_luigi     I can't say exact citations or anything, but it reminds me of something I read recently about being surprised. That is, humans become surprised when there's a sudden change in scenery, like light or sound or object. Obviously to protect from predators and etc etc. So the ""fight or flight"" mode would turn on during these times. With a commercial/jump cut, there's a bunch of sudden changes, but I guess it becomes a positive reaction instead of negative. Kind of like how tickling stems from pain is what I'm guessing, and how people like horror movies.     you can put purple in without rebleaching :) it would be different if you wanted to go, say, pink. but you could go purple or aqua-green really easily. 

there's some other tips out there. some people recommend dying every 1-2 weeks... it's easier because you can put the blue over your black hair and it won't dye it. you can rinse out with vinegar to keep from fading. you can also mix the dye with a conditioner to keep in your hair while you shower. 


also, dark pillowcases!


i love hair dye :P     Is it? His recipe is still [here](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/beef-jerky-recipe/index.html). I don't remember what was in the 2nd half, but that's all you really need to know.     Saw his stuff through Gallery 1988's newsletter, too.      Even cheaper is using a box fan instead of a dehydrator. [Alton Brown explains.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIK4DVLHf7Y)     i don't know if it's just me, but she looks like michelle from skins too!     trying to recover from anorexia nervosa right now (and always). this one quote my nutritionist said sticks with me:

""Telling someone with an eating disorder to eat is like telling someone in a wheelchair to get up and walk.""

other addictions, in my opinion, get easier with time. i'm not so sure this is the same for anorexia.     this is what kept me from learning how to drive, although i finally did a year ago. it was especially sneezing i was afraid of. i get too much anxiety in a two-lane. too much!     the same is happening to me right now. i had $4k out of high school, but in less than a year, got down to under $100 (from no job). finally got myself a job, and my bank account is $600-ish. this is with my parents helping me, too, though.     I'm trying to gain weight as well, and see a nutritionist.  There are a lot of great ideas here that I'll keep in mind (thanks again, Reddit!)

I eventually got really tired of eating nuts and avocados and heavy things, so I recently found that juice is helpful.  A glass of juice can have as many calories as milk (just not as much protein).  Eating a lot can get tiring, at least for me, so variety is the most important thing. 

I recently got a crockpot, too.  Throw in a bunch of beans, seasoning (bouillon, curry spices, etc), eat it with some rice. Cheap as all hell. Mixed beans, lentils, split peas... throwing in frozen veggies are an easy way to make it interesting, too. Meats are delicious and everything, but I find that they aren't a lot of calories for it's price/hassle.

I also drink generic Ensure Plus (350 cals per 8oz). It can seem expensive (I think $1-2 per bottle) but the amount of calories is worth it.      i agree. i got mine a couple years ago. i don't remember it being a painful experience.     it can still be obsessive-compulsive behavior. not a disorder, but this can still be a (small) part of OCD/OCPD.      i have difficulty eating, and i'm trying to gain weight. more sugar in my diet is actually ""good"" for me, since sugar is still an energy source. it's more nutritious than nothing. fruit juice, for me, is better/healthier than water.      i thought the same thing, specifically with the stars and rainbows. i love stars and rainbows!     that's where he must have gone after [eating the cat treats](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8ISzf2pryI).     sort-of source: john green and his brother, hank, make videos under the name ""vlogbrothers"". they have a big following. very possibly real.     i have it too, and you don't have to have any",1
subject9229," National Guard and Cancer  Warning. Medical stuff ahead. So fuck me right? I recently visited a civilian doctor in regards to a growth on my testicle. The doctors are 95% sure it is cancerous. Fuck. I recently joined the National Guard (September 2014) and haven't even gone to Basic or AIT yet (I ship out in a few months).  I've been at an RSP unit since September. They say it is a easily treatable form of cancer and that I should be fine, but all I care about is if it will force me to get medically discharged? I planned on doing ROTC at my college and going active duty after that as well so will this have any effect on that? My MOS is 31B if that changes anything.   [Build Help] H440 Case Fans  Is there a way to attach the fan hub to the motherboard to control the fans rather than having them t speed 100% just attached to the PSU?   [Build Help] H440 Fan Hub  I'm rehooking up my fans after doing a bit of cable management with their wires and was wondering if it matters which slot I hook each fan up to. Does it matter which I hook the molex up to?  [Build Help] PCs and the Cold  So I bough my parts on Friday and they started to arrive today. First off, holy fuck, these part are massive. I was expecting smaller sized parts but ATX parts are massive. My GPU alone is half the size of my old desktop. That leads me to my question, My pats were sitting out in the cold do a few hours as far as I can tell. Will this hurt them in any way?  [USA-OH][H]Paypal [W] SATA 3.0 cable  I bought a HDD and it doesn't have a SATA cable and I need one.   A quick question about performace  So I just bought a Sapphire R9 290 as my first GPU and I was curious if anyone else here has the same card and could give me an idea of how it runs Fo3 and NV. Obviously it should kill both games, but does anyone have any benchmarks and FPS readings?  [Build Help] XFX DD R9 290  I have been doing a lot of research on this card, but was wondering If anyone could post their experience with it. It's currently $250-$30 on Newegg and I'm extremely tempted to buy it. Mainly I have heard that it's cooler sucks.   [USA-OH][H]Paypal, $250 Amazon Credit [W] R9 290/290x or GTX 980  Amazon + PayPal for a GTX 980 to be clear. Sorry for any confusion. I'd also do just Amazon or just PayPal or a combo of both for a 290.   [Build Ready] Here we go, my build is finalized (again) hopefully for the last time.  I was hoping some of y'all could look over my build. I had a build all set up with SLI GTX970's but the VRAM issue turned me off to it. I have since decided to go with a single GTX980 and SLI it with another GTX980 or a GTX980Ti (if it will ever exist) in the future. I have explored my options with other cards, namely the AMD R9 290(X) in Crossfire, but have settled on the GTX980, with plans to SLI with it in the future. For now, it will be run off of a 1080p 60Htz HDTV, so its definitely overkill, but I plan on upgrading to a 1440p or 4K monitor in the future, and will probably SLI at the same time. My main goal was to run games at 1080p and ~70 fps.

**CPU** 

I got this CPU for a fairly good price over at /r/hardwareswap. I was originally going to use a i5 4690k, but since I wasn't ever planning on OCing, I went with the  i7. Plus it's hyperthreading will be used for engineering stuff.

**Motherboard**

I chose this motherboard because it matches my color scheme I am going for and has more than enough of the features I'll need.

**Memory**

I went with 8gb since I'm on a budget and couldn't fit any more in. I chose 1x8 so I have more room to upgrade in the future. I know 2x4 would be better performance but I want to be able to upgrade to 32gb later to use some as a Ram disk.

**Storage**

Pretty standard stuff. I chose a well reviewed 256gb SSD and a well review 1 TB HDD. It is more than enough space for me. 

**GPU**

Its expensive, but its a great card. I chose the MSI Twin Frozr GTX980 since it has the best all round performance. I love how it shuts off  its fans when its idle. Probably not the best price-wise but I think its worth it

**PSU**

Its a well reviewed PSU and is just enough for SLI GTX980's

**OS**

Doesn't really matter what I have since I'll be upgrading to Windows 10 when it is released. 

**Wireless Network Adapter**

Its cheap and allows me to use Wi-Fi. 

**Case**

I have arranged with a guy on /r/hardwareswap to buy this case and 3x Noctua NF F-12 case fans for $110. (Case $70 + Fans $40). Very good deal for me IMO. 



Should be a beast of a build. Probably a bit overkill and it just barely fits in my price range.   [Build Help] MSI GTX 980  Can I take off the fan shroud on the MSI twin Frozr? I'm trying to go with a blue and white build, but the card is red and I'd like to paint it blue.   [Help] OHP  Can I do OHP and bring the bar to the back of my neck instead of my chest? It seems to work my shoulders better.   [Build Help] crossfire sapphire Tri-x 290x or MSI Twin Frozr GTX 980 (and SLI later)  I'm a bit torn. Cost isn't really an issue, but I would like to spend as little as possible for great performance.   [WTS]Guns and Gear (Prices Reduced)   Hey y'all I'm trying to finance a new computer so I'm selling most of my airsoft stuff.

[**Pics**](http://imgur.com/a/dyCjY)


I have my baby that I hate to get rid of, but sadly never really got a chance to use and as such has less than 300 rounds shot through it. It is a custom built **Colt Commando (basically a fixed carry handle M4)** based on the rifle carried by Delta operator Gary Gordon in the Battle of Mogadishu (Black Hawk Down incident). Internally, it has a reshimmed G amp;amp;P gearbox and a 6.03mm tightbore.It also has a brand new SHS hop up and bucking. This thinks shoots insanely well. It is full metal and comes with a mock suppressor, a Surefire Scout Mini (and two batteries), a Red Dot scope (with red/green and multiple dot styles to choose from) a 300rd high cap, and an 11.1v lipo. This thing shoots lasers with the 11.1v and it can easily out range most other AEGs. It shoot ~375-390 fps


**I am asking ~~$250 shipped OBO Now $175+shipping**~~ **Now $145+ shipping** Does not come with Surefire. It was parted out and sold. 



I have a brand new **CYMA M14 Socom** in black. This thing was never used and has had less than 200 rounds shot through it. It was literally opened, tested  to make sure it worked and then never used again. It comes with one high cap magazine. The red dot sight in the pictures is not included. It has a battery, but one of the wires got pulled out, so it needs reattached. It shoots ~340 fps.


**I'm asking ~~$100 OBO.~~ Now $70+ shipping**


Next up we have the gear.


First up, I have a real steel PASGT helmet in large. It was used by the US military from the late 70's up until recently. It has all the suspension and chin strap stuff needed. It is in excellent condition. They usually sell for around $90-100. I'll throw in a helmet liner in M-81 as well if you want it.


**Asking ~~$65 OBO~~ 50+ ship**


Last, I have a real steel M-81 PASGT flak vest in small. I'm 6'3"" and this fits me perfectly. This vest is rated to stop up to a .44 magnum round. It was also used by the US military. One of the shoulders had a small tear, but it was fixed. These usually sell for around $80-90


**Asking ~~$55 OBO.~~ Sold**


Miscellaneous Items


**Echo-1 Stag-15 plastic body $10 .20 G amp;amp;G BBs (1kg) $10 **


**Speedloader x 2 free with the purchase of an aeg or PASGT component- just tell me**


**M100 spring-unused $7 3-9x Scope $20**


All prices are OBO and I may part out. Prices do not include shipping (again I'm open to offers for price if mine are too high) Trades are PC parts or more airsoft stuff


I also have some ALICE gear if anyone is interested, but unsure if I really want to sell it, I have LC-2 suspenders and a LBV along with tons of mag, canteen, and butt pouches  [Build Help] Sapphire R9 290 Tri-X  I have the opportunity to pick up one of these for pretty cheap ($220 shipped) but I am unable to find any performance reports on the card.

I bought the i7 on an impulse for $240, which I think was a more than fair price. I was going to use a i5-4690. but got this for only a few bucks more.

I'm hoping to run games at 1080p or better and 60+ FPS which I don't think will be any problem at all. Can anyone who has a similar setup give some idea of what it'll run at?

Anyway I can make it cheaper without changing the specs of the CPU, GPU, and Ram?  [Build Help] I7 4790  I'm about to purchase a i7 4790 because I'm getting it for $20 more than a i5 4690k (what I planned to use). Is this a good deal and is it worth it? Can I use it later if I want to overclock? Is it better than the 4690k?  [USA-OH][USA-OH] Heavy Duty PC case  [removed]  [USA-OH] [H] PayPal.

On to the guns.
I have my baby that I hate to get rid of, but sadly never really got a chance to use. It is a custom built Colt Commando based on the rifle carried by Delta operator Gary Gordon in the Battle of Mogadishu (Black Hawk Down incident). Internally, it has a reshimmed G amp;P gearbox and a 6.03mm tightbore. It is full metal and comes with a mock suppressor, a Surefire Scout Mini (and two batteries), a Red Dot scope (with red/green and multiple dot styles to choose from) a 300rd high cap, and an 11.1v lipo. This thing shoots lasers with the 11.1v and it can easily out range most other AEGs for some unknown reason. It shoot ~375-390 fps

I am asking $250 shipped OBO

Next up is my ICS Full Metal MP5. It is in good condition, with the only problem being that the selector switch is a little loose. It still functions fine and won't move unless you try and move it. It just doesn't click into place very well. It shoots ~330-350 fps. It comes with the red dot sight currently pictured on the M14 in the pictures, a Tokyo Marui claw style rail for the red dot, a railed handguard, a laser, 4 magazines, and a bunch of miscellaneous parts. 

I'm asking **SOLD**

Lastly, I have a nearly new CYMA M14 Socom in black. This thing was never used and has had less than 200 rounds shot through it. It was literally opened and then never used again. It comes with one high cap magazine. The red dot sight in the pictures is not included. It has a battery, but one of the wires got pulled out, so it needs reattached. It shoots ~340 fps.

I'm asking $100 OBO.

Next up we have the gear.

First up, I have a real steel PASGT helmet in large. It was used by the US military from the late 70's up until recently. It has all the suspension and chin strap stuff needed. It is in excellent condition. They usually sell for around $90-100. I'll throw in a helmet liner in M-81 as well if you want it.

Asking $65 OBO

Last, I have a real steel M-81 PASGT flak vest in small. I'm 6'3"" and this fits me perfectly. This vest is rated to stop up to a .44 magnum round. It was also used by the US military. One of the shoulders had a small tear, but it was fixed. These usually sell for around $80-90

Asking $55 OBO. 

Miscellaneous Items

Echo-1 Stag-15 plastic body   $10
.20 G amp;G BBs (1kg)   $10
Speedloader x 2  free with the purchase of an aeg or PASGT component- just tell me     
M100 spring-unused   $7
3-9x Scope   $20

All prices are OBO and I may part out.
Prices do not include shipping (again I'm open to offers for price if mine are too high)
Trades are PC parts or more airsoft stuff 

I also have some ALICE gear if anyone is interested, but unsure if I really want to sell it, I have LC-2 suspenders and a LBV
  [Build Ready] My First Build-Take 2  So, I changed a few things around (actually a lot of things) and I need some critique before I pull the trigger on this build. My main goal is to run modern games at least at 1080p w/ ~60fps. I'm fairly certain it will, but will this build do that?

I am also not planning on overclocking at this time, but I chose the i5-4690K because I probably will in the future and having the cpu unlocked is better IMO. My main concern is the cooler I chose. I do not know if it will be able to handle the increase during overclocking. Will it to maybe to 4.0-4.5ghz?

I chose the Asus MoBo mainly because it was cheapish and is SLI capable. I plan to buy a second GPU in the future. I don't see anything that could interfere with the build in regards to this motherboard, but does anyone see anything?

The GPU I chose is kinda straightforward. Its a Gigabyte G1 Windforce. No foreseen problems here, as I made sure it will fit in my case. 

Speaking of cases, I chose the Corsair Vengeance C70 in Black. I wanted something that looked heavy duty and military-esque and this fit the bill perfectly. My main gripe is there are only two USB ports on the front, but that's a minor issue.

I chose 16GB of ram because I like to overcompensate. Pretty much the only reason.

Same with the PSU I chose. Overcompensation. I probably don't need 750w, but I'm going to SLI in the future, so I guess its better to buy one powerful enough now so I dont't have to spend more in the future.

I chose a well rated SSD and a good 1 TB HDD for storage. I probably won't need that much space. My current laptop has a 250GB HDD and I haven't even filled it halfway in the five years I've had it. 

Last of all, I need the wi-fi card because I am too far away from my router to hook up directly. 

Before I pull the trigger, does anyone see any glaring issues or problems? 
Will I need any more wires?

Are the C70's stock case fans good enough?

Should I switch to a CPU water cooler? I was looking at Corsairs liquid cpu coolers, but I'm unsure. Plus my case has a spot on top for a radiator and it feels like a shame to let it go unused. 

Anyone know wher I can get 8gb RAM sticks cheaper? I couldn't find any.   [Build Ready]My First Build. Unsure if it's correct  This is going to be my first build and I put this parts list together. I am unsure if I should do anything different and I need critique. My budget is/was $1400. Anyone have any changes to make it cheaper? My goal is to play games at 1080p @~60fps

 | Generated by PCPartPicker 2015-01-06 19:14 EST-0500 |  First Gun Purchase  I'm not new to firearms by any means. I've grown up around them and shooting them. That being said, I'm about to turn 18 in a few days and am looking to get an AK pattern rifle. Currently, I (or rather my father) own a Tikka T3 Lite and a Winchester Hunting Shotgun (they're my firearms but technically are owned by my father since I'm 17). I've mainly used them for hunting and shooting skeet, but now I am looking to get a rifle that's semi automatic and is more of a ""modern"" rifle than my T3. I was looking at a AK pattern rifle in either .556 or .308 and was wondering if it's possible and if anyone knows where I could get a rifle that takes STANAG mags or 7.62 SR-25/AR mags that's also an AK pattern. I was looking at VEPRs and Saigas and thinking of doing a conversion. Any thoughts?  Alternate to hyperextensions?  I've been doing ICF 5x5 and working out at home over the holidays and can't do back hyperextensions. Is there an alternative?   [WTB]Non Magazine Molle and/or ALICE Pouches  Looking for utility pouches and misc. pouches. Not sure what I want, so offer away. I prefer any solid colors, Tri color desert or M-81 woodland. Anything other than digital camouflages and multicam are fine as well. 

Also looking for a hydration pack still, one that can hold gear as well as the reservoir. Something like a MBSS/MAP  [Wtb] Molle Hydration Pack  Looking for something similar to an MBSS or MAP pack. Does not have to be specifically hydration, just a pack that can attach to molle vests. Also, anyone know what the name of the medical backpack the assault class in Battlefield 3 uses? I'm also interested in one of those if anyone has one.   Welcome to /r/Project_Horizons!  This subreddit is currently under construction by me, but feel free to post anything related to Project Horizons. The only rule is that it has to be at least slightly relevant. NSFW is allowed, I'm not really picky about what is posted, I want to see what the community wants and give that to them. More rules ma be added in the future as things get going (if they ever do) but for now I,m just here to get the sub going.

Also install better ponymotes if you haven't already, because I haven't set up emotes yet so that'll have to do for now. 
[](/bjshake)  Defender vs. Discovery I/II/III vs. Range Rover Classic  I've been looking at Rovers recently and I   am a bit curious to which you think is better for off-road/overland type stuff that can also be used as a daily driver. I live in the USA, so obviously Defenders are few and far between unless I import one, which is a pain in the ass with the 25 year limit. I like the loons of the Defender a lot more than the Discovery, but is there any significant difference in off-road ability, other than the V8 in the Discovery vs. the Diesel in the Defender?    Despite their rarity of parts in the US, I am still leaning toward a Defender because of their Diesel engines and looks, but I cannot find of they are importable into the US with the diesel? 

Also just watched the Top Gear Bolivia special and I was surprised by Clarkson's Range Rover. I never really considered them mainly due to me thinking they were just sissy luxury SUVs, but obviously I was wrong. Any thoughts on them?  Running and Gaining  Should I be eating enough on days I dont lift but run to make up for calories burned running plus 500 over of should I just eat to maintain my weight?  OHARNG RSP  I have my first drill for RSP tomorrow in the OHNG. What should I expect? I've been told what to wear, where to go and when to be there, but I still have little idea of what I'll be doing when I get there.   I'm at MEPS  And I'm looking at jobs. My choices are 11B, 13B, 68W, 25U, and 19H. I'm really interested in 19K since it's a combat job and it has a enlistment bonus and kicker. Any tankers In the guard have any input or reason to do/not to do it?

Edit: actually I chose 31B as that came up as an option. Woo hoo! Enroute to my first day of RSP this weekend.   Found a 4runner. Have some questions.  It's a first gen and seems to be in great condition minus some fender damage that was poorly repaired (not a big deal). It also has a rear locker, 35"" BFGs, and a rebuilt 22re motor with 5k miles on it. but the owner says that it needs a front axel seal (it has a solid front axel) and a front U- joint installed. He says it still drives in 2w d fine, but I'm worried about the cost and skills needed. Are those difficult parts to install and is that something I can do without any special tools? Also would it be a bad idea to drive it without those parts installed?  Off Day + Running Diet Questions  First of all, I searched and couldn't find any answers to this. 

My current schedule is lift M/W/F and run 6 miles T/Th/Sat or Sun. On the days that I run, should I be eating TDEE + Calories Burned running + another 500 or should I just eat to maintain? I know it sounds stupid.   I'm currently at MEPS and I have a decision to make  [removed]  First Gen Possible Purchase Help  I'm looking to get a first gen as my first truck and was wondering if there is anything I need to watch out for. I currently drive a 97 Ford Ranger, but I co-own it with my brother and since I am going off to the army and college, I'm looking to get my own vehicle to be a daily driver and a fun off-road vehicle. 
I really like the design of the first gen with the removable top, but is there any reason I should get a second or third gen  over a first gen? And what do I need to watch out for?   [WTB] M4/M16 Upper Assembly  Looking for a complete full metal upper I could throw on my M4, not really looking for anything specific, and it does not need a hop up or inner barrel. Doesn't matter if it's painted either.   Help with understanding Guard/ROTC relationship  I'm joining the guard very soon and I'm hoping to go to college and do ROTC at the same time. Should I apply to colleges now as well, or wait until I am in the Guard? Also, do I have to use the GI Bill while in the Guard, or is there a special guard scholarship? I'm hoping to go active duty after college as an officer if that changes anything.   [WRB]Lots of gear.  [removed]  My high school cross country team recovers some bad new today...  We learned that our former coach, who had to resign due to having cancer, passed away this morning after a long struggle with his disease. We all knew that it was coming, but it was never the less a sad day. He loved coaching and the day he had to resign was the only time I had ever see him cry. He was always great at pushing us and making sure we were the best we could be. I never got to say it to him, but thank you coach. Your coaching made me a better runner and a better person. You will be missed by everybody.   [WTB] M4 Mags  Looking for cheap mid or high cap mags. Doesn't matter how many. Just need them to be standard metal mags.  Not looking to spend a lot. I need them somewhat cheaply.   [WTB]Smart Charger and batteries  Looking for a cheapish smart charger and some batteries that will fit in a buffer tube. Non lipo preferred, unless you also have a charger/discharger to go with it.   CJ-3B Question  I found a CJ-3B on craigslist for $800. It needs a lot of work, and It doesn't run, but do you think it would be worth it to restore it?

1.jessica jones

2.daredevil

3.luke cage

tho honestly they were all pretty good, but for me Jessica jones had the best villain fisk was also very good, but killgrave was an amazing villain. daredevil had the best action scenes by far and very entertaining good storytelling. Luke cage was also very good but falters because luke cage doesn't really have a great villain, cottenmouth was good tho =/.  which is the best Netflix marvel show?

subject1101,"    Because he saw a movie once?     It's Canadian and was produced for dirt cheap by a team of maybe 13 people. So they'd just fart out a season whenever Canada's Comedy Central needed half-hours to fill.     World War Zimmerman and The Hobbit are probably tied for first.

Zimmerman because it wasn't funny, felt like it would never end, and is a perfect representation of modern South Park's baseline idiocy.

The Hobbit because of its sloppy storytelling, bad running gags, and dated message.     dude you're the first person i've ever seen on reddit mention that show. [my username is from kevin spencer.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo2zU-OdtYA) show is atrocious. but it's like so obscure. even though it went for 7 seasons. ahahaha can't believe it     ...

...

...

...lol!     /r/southpark is an echo chamber. This episode sucked.     Yeah, he did American Dad! a few years ago.     Yeah, I'm surprised. This sub is very hyperbolic with its love. So I like seeing some negativity at the top just for once.     um this thread is NOT home!!!     Not relevant. Could you wait until you get home to bust out your Avatar hateboner?     Um... I think it's pretty silly they're announcing every cameo filmed. I'm hardly upset about it, and it has nothing to do with /r/movies.     It's not about spoilers.     Do they have to announe every damn cameo? Publicity overdose right here.     I guess its sort of relevant, but the fact that it's #1 right now is pretty bizarre.     Sharknado 3 being my personal favorite.     Someone that was in my fifth grade class once said they had a crush on me, but they admitted that like 6 years later. Am I cool yet?     /r/rickandmorty is the worst TV show subreddit in existance. I challenge anyone to find a more hyperbolic and embarassing circlejerk anywhere on this site.     Grilfriend, more like Amazon, xD

...have we really regressed to the point that fucking ""I have a girlfriend"" is a phrase that has to be looked at with skepticism?  south park season 17 proof of purchase gets owned       I don't see the problem. Oh no, a... dick gravestone. How dare someone memorialize someone positively. Did he write it from beyond the grave? Who cares?

There are many reasons to dislike Bob Kane, but I don't think shitting on his gravestone is the best way to get that across     How's it even relevant outside of lazily parroting SP for upboats?     i saw it too. We're all cool  Another zero substance AskReddit post on the front page... sigh.       ""Freedom Isn't Free"" is a common idiom. So it's likely Team America just got it from that.     I'm able to enjoy the older episodes though, and NO, I don't get every reference. 

So the increasing US-centric news dependance just makes me sad.     Bad excuse.

Source: not American, dig tons of American shows without having to ""adapt"".     ""Carbon monoxide makin me choke"" - Weird Al's parents     It sounds deeper and less mushmouthed.     That's been the show for at least the past nine seasons. Are you really surprised?     I agree with you 100%. And I thought the show fell off spectacularly during the second and third quarters of the season, too, so I ain't biased, I swear it.     Sounds like crap. Another topical issue, what fun. Can't wait for SP to take a brave stanc... lol     I saw an article the other day titled ""Why Aren't More Black Voters Feeling the Bern?""

...oof.  The Martian The Martian The Martian The Martian The Martian The Martian The Martian The Martian The Martian The Martian The Martian The Martian       Ah yes, it wasn't meant to be funny. I too was gripped by the drama Phil being an unlikable jackass every episode...     Yeah, the first one is definitely a joke. Peter says ""this is like when I got that expired coupon"" and then it does a cutaway to him fighting the chicken elaborately. The length is the joke.     I did. (from Oliver Twist, though)     It's his middle name. His first name was Granville. What would you pick?     nop     He isn't though     No. Glover was born in 1964     Because the creators have said it wasn't. To get laughter, they'd play pre-taped episodes for an audience.

If you want a show that NEVER used an audience, look no further than ALF. The format of the show (the ALF puppet was prone to frequent malfunctions, and had to placed in specially made trap doors so the puppeteer could operate it) meant that taping in front of a live audience would've been severely impractical, as scenes as simple as ALF talking to someone might require as much as 15 takes just to get right. Because of this, all laughter was insert during planned pauses during audio post.     Baking Bad is a Family Guy episode, and well, the character of Joe is in it. So I guess his comment stands.     IMDB can disable that itself. https://secure.imdb.com/register-imdb/siteprefs - under ""Number of TV episodes from the same series to display"" select ""None"".     These two are the ones that have thrown me the most.     everything appears nominal  What are two TV shows that people might be surprised to know were once both airing new episodes at the same time?  Family Guy and Mystery Science Theater 3000 is my most interesting one. 

They seem so far apart... but not really, I guess.     There's a chrome app for this. https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/imdb-hide-episode-spoiler/chiakepmphnoipoamanblmjmnigmgbkh?hl=en

I think a Redditor made it, actually.     It's generally thought of as the last truly great film noir.     nah     Sounds bad. No wonder Reddit never talks about him.     Havent heard of him. Does he have any overlooked gems under his belt?     older = old???     Yeah especially when there are a lot of people OVER 76 who are still making films.     https://twitter.com/wescraven/status/638161499043688448     Still gettin' that sweet comment karma.     6     One of the unwritten rules of Reddit is that trashing South Park instantly nets you downvotes.

Personally I think it was consistently funny up until season 6 or 7 or so, then it began to fumble a bit by season 10, and now it's just wildly hit-and-miss, with the worst episodes (""The Hobbit""/""World War Zimmerman"") being borderline unwatchable.     They made Stan a fuckin moron last season. Like that subplot where he makes people invisible by snapping, what the hell was that?     Nope. It was canned after season 2 but the decision was reversed last-minute. Then, after season 3, it was canned for good, but Adult Swim reruns and DVDs were doing so well they brought it back, and it hasn't been canned again.     I want to be happy about this, but the TBS season was a marked decline over the FOX seasons. There was just a continuous feel of staleness throughout the entire thing. I'll wait to see if the next season is good before getting excited about this     Agree. Vote Mark Bair 1933.     no     Adult Swim tweeted it out with a picture of a pair of glasses, with the text ""These goggles will help you see the end"".     Maybe somebody'll repost it and reap more karma than I?     no     ""Don't learn anything about the gunman! Turn off the TV if there's gunman coverage!"" Seems like he doesn't.     I liked Cinema Sins until they made all their videos 20+ minutes. Watching a video that long that's ENTIRELY nitpicks is just tiring. And the videos used to have a jokey, non-serious vibe, but now they're fully committed tojust nitpicking seriously. There are occasional good jokes/observations but it just gets tiring.     I'm not comfortable to fully say that. I think Summit and Lionsgate are just bad at marketing. Their movie Child 44 was based on a book and also bombed like crazy.     Yeah, Landis isn't being very objective here. To paraphrase: ""American Ultra is, honestly, a good movie. The fact that it bombed obviously means the end of original ideas as we know it.""

Uh, let's see. It tried to market Kristen Stewart to an audience generally against Kristen Stewart (and what box office credence does she have outside of Twilight - which was already established and didn't depend on her?) and Eisenberg is pretty hit and miss fo most people. It got rather poor reviews. The marketing was pretty sparse. These all seem like legitimate reasons for a movie to fail.

So what if your movie has ""big stars, a fun idea, and honestly, [was] a good movie..."" (his words)? All the above factors seem like reasons a movie would bomb. There's very little here that has ANY sort of draw. I definitely believe he's shifting the blame a bit.     yet it bombed because horror fans will go see any kind of crap and because more marketing was put behind Hitman.

This doesn't seem to be comparable to ""original ideas don't make bank!"" though. I think the piss marketing for this movie did it in. Didn't even know it existed until I saw a preview for it at the theater... like two days ago. (And I don't want to see it because it looks bad.)     Kaydyn is an orgy of letters. No two Ys should ever be that close, and the fact that the second Y is a substitute (the Y DIDN'T NEED TO BE THERE) is inexcusable. Michael sounds nice and the letters all go together moderately well. I'm a sucker for ""ae""s, one of the better looking letter combination in this English language of ours. But if you're a Kaydyn fan, it's OK! We still have people trying to ruin it by pulling a Kaydyn and sticking a Y in there (looking at YOU, Mychael Danna).     The Simpsons as a whole is monstrously influential. It may have gotten bad, but the influence it had (and the phenomenal first eight or so seadons) is still active today. It's earned its stripes.

Rick and Morty never would've existed without The Simpsons, and it is unlikely that it will have even a quarter of an impact The Simpsons did.     Why? Why can't a new show be fucking awesome and worthy of acclaim until proven shitty in a later season? e.g. Lost, Dexter.

A show in its first season is still growing. These high ratings are not represantive of a GREAT SHOW, just a first season that turned out to be really good. Whereas with shows like The Simpsons, the entire show has been scrutinized and ends up with an 8, because this is something that can be accurately judged. Rick and Morty being so high is a circlejerky embarassment. It has one season and a second season is currently airing. All that can be judged is a show that's still brand new and still growing.     It still shows up, but it never gets far.     Around two years ago it was almost inescapable.     That sort of clashes with the TIL rules which state not to repost TILs that have made it high up in the past.     You have a legitimate point. I feel that even though it is likely someone will see a heavily-reposted TIL for the first time on the 72548th repost, it doesn't justify regurgitating unoriginal TILs tons of times.     FWIW I haven't defended piracy, so it's not the same people.     Oh come on, I never said anything about being MAJORLY distressed by a repost. I just think it's irritating, because I've seen this way more than twice.     Well, you might as well post it here now. ;'|     I know this always comes up. ""I wouldn't have seen it if this wasn't reposted."" But seriously? There's a possibility someone out there hasn't seen the Steve Buscemi 9/11 firefighter TIL... doesn't mean it's not an unoriginal and oversaturated thing to post. I think there should be a limit to how many times a TIL can be posted, because, hell, even posting the same TIL every day might result in someone seeing it for the first time after the 3rd day.     Whenever movies that just came out are brought up in recent threads, Man from UNCLE is seemingly always mentioned as being an Overlooked Gem that you should Totally See to fight the studios.

BTW, in the time it took you to read this comment, you could have seen Man from UNCLE 816572057529682 times, shame on you.     Reddit sucked this show's dick for over a year

Wait, that stopped?     Ok, the presence of Angry Video Game Nerd at #87... this list should not be taken with much credence.     Too high imo     Gnomeo   Juliet     Well according to wiki his name is ""Jerry S. Parr"". Close enough.     THIS SUB HAS LITERLY BECOME SRS     Yeah, this is the simple one that makes me feel old. For reference, I started my IMDB account in May 1999, and I recently had a conversation with a guy who was born in May 2001. This guy, who is fully lucid and can make concious decisions, is younger than my fucking IMDB account, what the fuck.     Yeah, I agree. I think Dewey Cox is decent but it meanders a bit and wears out its welcome by the end (the arduous extended cut isn't any better). I WANTED to discuss that aspect of the movie, but nope, it's just people regurgitating ""the wrong kid died"" over and over.       ...what was the meaning before?     Not negative... it's just probably the reason why it's not getting tons of upvotes.     Because it's not a very original thought and has been in EVERY thread related to AM?     Looks like it got deleted though before it got very far.  A ""The Big Bang Theory"" assistant director is suing for age discrimination after his workload was reduced without agreement, his job was given to younger people, and he was eventually terminated despite no provided instances in which his performance was insufficient.       ""Most of the people in this 1936 movie are dead. When you watch this movie, you are seeing dead people act.""

...who cares? (and it's not true anyway)     The only sitcom I know of that didn't use a live studio audience but still had a laugh track is ALF. Are there really that many that never had actual audiences? I'd imagine the actual number has tapered off in recent years, because really the only multi-cam sitcoms with laugh tracks airing today are Chuck Lorre shows, and those are all filmed live with audiences.     Uh... like?     At least most of the comments are callin OP out for his BS     One of the replies to that comment is Alec Sokolow (who co-wrote both Garf movies) calling Bill Murray out for lying.  cedric the entertainer/sally struthers sex tape leaked  yes  Straight Outta Compton: Universal offers to reimburse theaters for extra security    Man in minion costume gets what he deserves    Chris Farley version of Shrek leaked    minion gets owned     Bobby Moynihan Departing Saturday Night Live After 9 Seasons    Bobby Moynihan Departing Saturday Night Live After 9 Seasons       Created by a Trumper.

I can imagine him playing some meek old man on a TV sitcom.     I didn't exactly give him a chance as much as I deluded myself into thinking he was just being crazy to get into office so he turn out to be wouldn't be as bad as I feared. Nah, he really is an insane motherfucker     Montana     Yeah Pence once wished Garfield a happy birthday on the House floor. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHnZphCBWTA     Huh? That's the whole point of the site. Put a name in there, it works. It's meant as a site to generate random joke articles about celebrities.

I'm not saying this news is true, but mediamass doesn't disprove anything.     Mediamass is bogus. You can put any celebrity name in the URL and it vomits up those death hoax articles that are all the exact same outside of automatically generated biographical details.      ""I hope trump never stops digging and grinding into these people's eye.""

Same. It would be just awful for him to motivate the people who hate him to vote against him.     First Dr Ken got the axe and now this, must all be part of The Community Movie comin to fruition      the rate and coverage of them being disowned it's more than likely a strong case against Ben.

 it's probably true because it spread across the internet really fast

      This Is Why Trump Won

How? What will Trump do to specifically combat this?     IIRC didn't the remaining Lostprophets members just form another band with a new vocalist? I dunno if that's really crumbling. 

I'm no expert but it doesn't look like the other PWR BTTM member will be able to come back from this.     Huh, he's right. The kind of people that like Al Franken aren't Republicans, and Republicans typically like Reagan.     I mean, if that guy was talking about Eastwood politically, he's right. His only experience is that he was the nonpartisan mayor of Carmel-by-the-Sea for less than two years. While from what I understand it's a beautiful place it's also not very populated or well known, so it's easy to see why his empty chair debate is probably what would come to mind.     Not old enough until 2024 :'(     Yeah, I really doubt he gets away with visiting Trump.

The Rock though? If he had experience, he would be a shoo-in for POTUS. He's poised and professional, level-headed, and nobody really dislikes him. I'd say his biggest issue is that he is barely involved politically. Normally when a celebrity is able to glide into office they've still been active politically for a while (Franken with his many books and radio talk shows, Reagan rooting out communism in the SAG, Ventura as a small-town mayor and third party champion). The Rock all I know about him politically is that he was registered Republican for a little bit and he disapproved of Trump's travel ban. That's not a whole lot to work with especially if he wants to run soon.      Ted Nugent

Don't you mean FUTURE SENATOR KID ROCK?

(Anything come of that?)     I agree with you on The Rock, not Kanye though.     Schilling I seriously doubt walks the walk. He would get destroyed.     Depends. I wouldn't be so sure Trump has opened the floodgates. If some celebrity runs for the presidency with no experience, I wouldn't vote for them. For house/governor? That's been happening for quite a while, and is worth consideration if they prove themselves politically viable. It's also worth noting that some people just aren't electable. For example Antonio Sabato Jr, a minor celebrity and vocal Trump supporter, says he wants to run in his CA district for Congress. You could think ""oh no celebrity!"" but it is so blue that he stands no chance. (I forget the exact district at the moment, but IIRC it's the one with Westlake Village in it.) Also, there's the fact that most celebrities are left-leaning and therefore hate ol' Donnie. Don't think they're rushing to follow in his footsteps.

I don't particularly care about people rambling about 2020 until it actually happens. For example all the rumbling about Zuckerberg doesn't concern me because he is basically the definition of unelectable; he has no charisma, is a horrendous public speaker, has loads of baggage, and no Democrat will accept some experienceless businessman after Trump.      I don't care about a huge racist screaming at Muslims crying in a mugshot. He is just going to vote Trump again in 2020.     [Renewed](http://ew.com/tv/2017/05/11/agents-shield-season-5-renewal/)     Isn't Imaginary Mary like three episodes in? They really eviscerated that one...

It's aired seven of its eight episodes so far, but it was one of those shows where the network chopped the amount of episodes it got even before it hit the air, so it's clear they didn't have any faith in it.  ABC cancels comedies ""Dr. Ken"", ""Imaginary Mary"", and ""The Real O'Neals""       I'm going to go against the grain here and say I thought Making History was pretty bad. It was an interesting concept but I didn't care about any of the characters. John Hancock and Sam Adams were quite annoying and I've hated the last few episodes that centered on them, and Leighton Meester's character's whole thing is that she's unassuming and from the past. Yawn. Yassir Lester and Adam Pally had decent chemistry together, but the show itself just wasn't all that entertaining.

Son of Zorn felt like it could've become good if it had another season to iron out the kinks. The problem with it was that Tim Meadows and Jason Sudeikis were far far funnier than anyone else in the cast and it was just annoying when they would focus on stupid relationship stuff with the kid who was a terrible actor. Also it's pretty funny that they ended the season with an insane cliffhanger which will now never be resolved.     It's pretty shaky and last season was admittedly full of filler but it did get quite good near the end I thought. Plus regardless of what you think of the show it shouldn't end on a cliffhanger.     Trump is just angry that Blumenthal is older than him yet doesn't look like a walking dumpster fire.     God damn. Trump is such a fucking idiot. He has hours and hours of bad press because of this Comey thing, and then breaks his silence by lamely insulting Chuck Schumer and addressing nothing else. Time for another round of ""I can't believe people fucking voted for this guy.""     Glad Wolves Lower is doin well. Definitely my favorite Chronic Town song  LOL, looks like Trump's got a new banner on Twitter. He totally doesn't care about this investigation though!!!        I hope they come back, but I honestly feel it works fairly well as a series finale

How come? If it gets canceled sure, this is probably better than last season's. But I would be pretty sad if this was the end, there's a lot of buildup they have yet to get to.     Not well. Their new submissions feed is a goldmine of salt atm.     *puts Le Cap on Le Pen*     Totally Not A Cult     Not right now! Go 6'4""     I remember some dude a few days ago smugly going ""ChapoTrapHouse has more subs than this sub, truly you are all irrelevant!"" 

Wonder where he is these days...     Yes, the camera work in this new season is definitely poor. It is the same flat shot for both the mads and the SOL. It's a definite step down from the previous seasons, and the fact that it's in widescreen makes all the dead space that much more notable.

Also, am I the only one who thinks movie sign is a bit too stationary this time around? The camera pretty much just wiggles a bit and that's it. Feels spectacularly lame each time. Are they afraid they'll show the edges of the set, or is the camera just stuck in that one spot?

For the most part I think the new show did a decent job at capturing the charm of the old show despite having a huge Hollywood cast and crew, but there are elements like these where you can tell they might've gone a bit too sterile and glossy.     to the gulag with you also you write so sad     Oh no! Mar-a-Lago is closing for the season?     Well, without any proof of when it was cut I have a hard time caring. Lots of shows are blindly trimmed down for re-release with scenes chopped indiscriminately. For all we know this could've been edited out in like, 1997 with no motive behind it at all.     Lolin hard at ""current president (my president)"". What a dweeb     ""It is not clear whether the 1996 segment was cut when it was first uploaded, or whether the edit was in reaction to recent controversies over Bill Nye's stance on gender identity.""

This part is pretty important imo. It could've just been a syndication cut that Netflix has always had. I personally doubt they'd go back and remove something like that, given that Netflix has a lot of ""offensive"" content that isn't edited.     thank Sen. Joe     I dunno, shirtless Trump sounds like anything but hilarious.     I just feel bad for the people who voted Trump not because they're alt-right but because they actually believed he'd bring back jobs that are long dead. Then again they will probably vote to re-elect him so maybe I should save my pity.     The one thing that makes me feel slightly better about all this is just how damn mad you know this dude was under Obama     It's ok, but it's not even close to second best.     oh no     Not exactly family, but the second host segment in The Brute Man is him and the bots calling his girlfriend.     I agree, Mike is by far the best host of the show. I know a ton of people disagree but I like that his era gradually snuffed out the all-ages lightheartedness of the Joel years. I mean, just look at that dark SOL!

also, his ""three guys carrying on"" dynamic with the bots is far superior to Joel's ""loving but wacky family"" one.     I don't see the problem. Of course it was rigged against Bernard the underdog. Everyone agrees with him on everything, so how can you explain his loss. Checkmate. Now to make it up to him we must allow Bernard to become king of and radically transform the party that did not vote for him. Neocon hacks like Jon Ossoff will eat dirt but True Progressives like Heath Mello will finally get their time to shine.     It was on /r/bikinibottomtwitter     No, there were 21 KTMA episodes, so Joel would have 86     I meant in terms of the majority. I would be fine with a progressive person taking Heitkamp's seat, and am definitely not a big fan of hers. I just want to go to bat for her as a reasonably useful tool from taking the GOP out of senate majority     Look, I'm not a huge fan of Heitkamp or people like Manchin, and I wouldn't cry if the seat went to a different Democrat. But, jeez, comments like this:
 A red state Democrat is a Republican in any moderate/liberal state. The idea that we should support her just because she calls herself a Democrat is laughable.

I mean, come on, you don't have to be going YEAH HEITKAMP and begging people to vote for her, but can't you at least acknowledge the fact that she's useful in getting the Senate to a 51 majority?     Govtrack.us' placement is from bill sponsorship. More than a tad misleading.     Well, this doesn't accomplish that. If this guy defeats Heitkamp and wins election, nothing happens. If that happens and this guy loses, the Republicans get another seat. What this guy really should be doing is waiting a few years and trying to defeat Hoeven     Is Ossoff even an ""extreme liberal""? He seems pretty benign to me.     I'd watch an Obama-hosted MST though     hi hows it goin     Fun fact: he's also in Stranded in Space from season 3.     It still doesn't fit the sub.     I dunno I have a hard time saying that it's some impossible task because we have 10 whole seasons of the old show that mostly got it right. The old show mostly realized that 5 seconds of dead air =/= 5 seconds of riffs. It's not really a criticism of ""this isn't funny!!"", it's ""this is poor presentation.""     I think it's definitely more apparent in the riffs in this season. It's blatantly obvious they aren't actually watching anything and the riffs are pasted in. For example the most recent episode I watched was Time Travelers and their riffs on the credits start the exact frame the credits fade in. (The joke on the Directed by Ib Melchior credit is halfway out before the name is even legible.)     Surely he has to be joking. The last time a Democrat really cleaned the EC was in 1964. The Republicans are by far the party of the Electoral College Landslide, and this goober thinks his 304 electoral votes entitles him to a seat at the ""against all odds"" table? Jeez.     Yeah, the way the SOL is staged, how huge he is doesn't really register in the host segments, but his silhouette definitely looks towering. Had to look it up to find out the dude is 6'5"".     Please calm     Man, this was a huge improvement over Reptilicus. The movie is just so mindbogglingly stupid but never really dull, hard to believe they never tackled it in the original series. Every character is nuts, the dubbing is ridiculous, and there's pretty much no plot, just consistently random scenes (Paul getting caught in the net is one of those hilarious moments in an MST3K movie where no riffing is even needed).

I agree with everyone who said the bubble transitions were pretty weird. Kinda distracted from an otherwise decent invention exchange.

The riffing is quite good in this episode. There are definitely a few moments with the rapid-fire joke strangling but I think this movie is much better suited to riffing than Reptilicus, something stupid is pretty much constantly happening so they don't really have a lot of dead air to fill.

The lack of any transition between the segment with Pearl/Bobo/Observer and the theater was kinda jarring. Surely a quick fade wouldn't have been hard to do and woulda looked much nicer. I agree that Bobo didn't look too good, but Bill barely missed a step.

Favorite riff: ""No longer will a hipster read the liner notes of a Tame Impala album.""     I didn't contribute because I didn't think it was gonna be any good. I feel like a bit of an idiot now.     Yeah, I'm with you. I think Joel-era MST3k, while good, pales in comparison to most Mike MST3k, and I've been really liking the new season. The only parts that seem especially Joel-like to me are the invention exchange (which tbh I'm not that big on) and the fact that goofing with the silhouettes is a bit more pronounced. Jonah himself definitely seems to be taking from both hosts in his performance, and the riffing reminds me a lot of, say, season 6 - Joel's sensibilities are there, but it's definitely its own thing.     Laughed so hard when the gun was pointed at Paul and then ""roll credits!""      Captive Worms

:V     Overall very good. Mostly solid riffing and decent host segments.

Praise:

- Jonah is a great host. He feels like a good mixture of Mike and Joel and he has solid chemistry with the bots, who are also reasonably funny themselves. I was very pleased with how natural they seemed even in this one episode.

- Felicia and Patton are a pretty solid duo. I was laughing really hard at Patton failing to come up with any actors outside of Dirch Passer.

- I really dig the Moon 13 house band. The way they play old songs is a great way to throw the old show a bone.

- The song in the first segment was amazing. Classic MST3K right there.

Criticisms:

- I don't really like the new opening sequence. It's too theatrical and showy and doesn't really mesh with the rest of the show. I saw a bit of episode 2 and it's pretty stupid they do the ""huh what the???"" bit both times. The fact that the Robot Roll Call is in silhouette with no identification is also pretty lousy.

- Tom flying and Gypsy dropping into the theater are both pretty useless additions. Definitely feels like adding stuff for the sake of it. Tom flying is probably the worst offender, though. It wasn't used for any good jokes and was just distracting. I get they want to play around with the silhouette but it's kinda hard given that the HD makes it a lot smaller.

- The puppetry isn't great. I'd give it a pass for being the first episode but I expected more from the fact that each robot has 3 credited puppeteers. But it definitely doesn't seem like these are professionals operating them. Crow's mouth hangs open when he talks and Gypsy's barely syncs up with her dialogue. They don't feel very animated.

- The riff paces needs work, yeah. For the most part I didn't think it was as bad as most people were saying but there were times where they definitely needed to slow up. Strangled a few good jokes simply because they were tossing out riff after riff.

- The show looks nice but it's not shot very interestingly. Just straight ahead flat. The old show at least had angles!

Best riff: ""It's just a sign that says Made You Look.""      Haven't heard it yet but don't the whole band have writing credits on it?     Aren't Netflix originals available on every Netflix? For instance Netflix lost the rights to the FOX seasons of Arrested Development, but they're still able to stream the season that was made for Netflix.      The Vimeo vhx site connected to the Kickstarter where backers can stream the episodes, obviously non-backers can't stream the videos buf the thumbnails (which are the film title cards) and the host segment summaries are viewable to all.     It's also not a real article. Mediamass is meant to be a joke news generator. You put in a celebrity name and it generates several articles, one of which is ""victim of death hoax"".     Mediamass is bogus. You can put any celebrity name in the URL and it vomits up those death hoax articles that are all the exact same outside of automatically generated biographical details. Don't trust it     I don't think he would get the nomination if he pledged that. You get a huge bonus at re-election just for being incumbent. Would the Democratic Party really want to go through primaries again just because their guy is old?     Can you explain to me how those 4 above aren't to the left of Ronald Reagan. I admit that I'm not an expert on any of them. But that seems hard to believe.     Non-backer with serious question. What's with being all hush hush ",0
subject1120," What book should I read next that will scare me?       Perfect place for a vampire to take a stroll at night.  Does anyone know how Eazy E got AIDS? Are there any theories?       He's pretty involved with the website, he practically stalks people (some literally), lots of different things...

Mainly, it's a joke. I hope so, anyway.     Oh sorry I thought you wanted suggestions for mystery books.     Pardon, Mi'peguiin.      I have a pet one, one I heard about on here actually.  Well, two:

* There was no Zodiac killer
* James Renner is responsible for whatever happened to Muara Murray.

I don't know if they are true but they are fun to think about.

ffffffgggdfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffgggggggggggggggggggg

      **The Stand** by Stephen King     **The Couple Next Door** it's a quick read. I'm about 60% done with it and I just started it last night. Definately a page turner. So far anyway.     You already have it. The first time I read it, it's brutality-Humbert without the flowery prose and vocab-stunned me. Let me know what you think.     **The End of Alice** by A.M. Homes

I don't know, I thought it was brilliant when I first read it, I read it again a year or so ago and just found it meeeeeeeeh. **Walmart Lolita**.      This is my idea of sexy stationary!      Thank you!  What are some good history channels that still upload?  I love history and have found several new channels as of late about history. I really can't get enough of them. Any channels that deal with Vietnam or anything from Roman times up until the War of 1812 in Europe or American History (since I know little) would be great.  

A google search told me this had been done, but it was a few years ago, so I was wondering if anything had popped up since then.     Oh nice find, thank you!     Thank you, I will check Kaptain Kristian out!     thank you!      Lindybeige

I love history, I will check him out.      Kurzgesagt

I have seen some of their videos I love the host.     I will check those out, thank you!     Excellent I love geography and History!     I used to love Vsauce, they don't seem to upload much anymore.     I have heard a lot about them and will check them out!     Thank you!     I will look into him :O)  Has anyone read, and enjoyed, books about books (the nonfiction kind)?  I have been hearing a lot lately about books about books. This one caught my eye: ***My Life with Bob***: by Pamela Paul, mostly because I have always wanted to keep a book journal and have no idea how to do it. I was thinking though, could a book *about* books be interesting and not dry. I love video games, too, but I imagine a book about all the technical details would be boring for me to read. What have your experiences been like?  Do any of you keep book journals? would you care to share a picture or at least how you make it work?       Thank you, those sounds like great channels.  Hi, CC! i am looking to switch from creepy/horror themed YouTube channels to more light hearted or even educational channels, what would you suggest?  I am trying to make the things that come into my head a little more healthy and positive and beneficial.      The cat wouldn't approve.     Love southern comfort food especially Mac and cheese.  [Serious] Chefs and cooks, what it your favorite thing to make? What is you least favorite thing?       Which is which? Is the other one the guy goes into the bar and doesn't come out?     What's The Deep about?  Will I get fired from my job?       But...it's a scribble...     I do this all the time.  Where did I put my ipod/alarm?

Sorry, newbie here. I have a,question about playing this in cpu vs Xbox One  I used to love the Sims on cpu and the old SIM City for PlayStation 1, so I am hoping this game would satisfy a bit of both. I don't know if I should get it for my CPU or Xbox, what have your experience been like? Is there a difference?  You have been visited by the Garlic Bread of death, up vote this or die eventually!  garlic bread.jpg     I know, I used to watch all his videos. There's just something that bothers me about him. I don't know what it is. Nothing specific.  Buyer assumes responsibility for the month-to-month tenancy in the upstairs apartment. Occupant has never paid, and no security deposit is being held, but there is a lease in place..buy a house with creepy hermit they said, it's a fun fixer upper they said. And then things got murdery.    How long until the American Civil War will start?  Do you think Trump will declare himself president for life?     I don't like John Green, The Fault in Our Stars was so pretentious. I also don't really like him as a person, I don't know why. He just doesn't sit right with me. 

I have heard he's not writing anymore.     Can you help promote my favorite YouTube Hellfreezer? He tells a mix of stories has a great voice and and endearing accent, he needs more subs and more patrons!      Usually, no. If they write non fiction and their personality comes shining through, I'll skip or get second hand.  I'm 42 and I decided to do something with my hormones, so I sat on the couch and ate ice cream while watching Hallmark movies and crying.    [Serious] How do you see president Trump's presidency ending?       Didn't you kill someone? Or was that MacAfee?      Who's Todd?     Thank you!     It's a very old urban legend with many different variations.     Yeah, pretty much everything I was thinking.     Where is this all heading?     Where was this?     *I need a book* I LITERALLY WAKE UP EVERY MORNING AND SAY THIS.     LOL So catty that site is.      I don't believe that in the least. That a fantasy certain people came up with to sell books or promote their websites.      James Renner is going to message you know.

I am occam's razor on this. I think she was running away, got into an accident, ran into the woods drunk and died.     I could only imagine what it was like for her husband with all these twists and turns.  What did my husband make for dinner?       **Joan Risch** is one of my favorites.

Zodiac of course is another, the cult the Son of Sam was working with is another, and Maura Murray, but in that one I just want them to find her body to put all the b.s. around the case to rest.  What do you think about Black Eyed Children?  [removed]     Fallout 3, is that you?     Night Film  Some people believe that there was contact between mainland Asia and the people's of pre-Columbia South America. Could this be disproved by the fact that the indigenous peoples of pre-Columbia society did not have smallpox until the Spaniards came?       I enjoyed it.     For a second I thought this was going to be about how King killed John Lennon.     Could you imagine?

""Mommy, mommy some pervy guy is flashing us!""

""Just stay right there girls, mommy needs a pic for the Internet.""

Here you go.  Cozy Island in Beautiful Garden       The Art of the Deal....I kid, I kid.

Stories normally don't ""scare me"" per se, but some stick with me. **You** by Kepnes stuck with me because I know there are people like that (psychopaths) out there. From **World War Z** the chapter on North Korea just haunted me. I don't know why but the possibilities of what could have happened really made me think and ponder for ages.     I just hope it's soon to bring closure to everything.     That one just weirds me out. Especially their actions before leaving and then the whole black magic thing.     She was expelled from Umass? I thought that was West Point?     Oh lol...um

Zodiac (but honestly, let's face it, we're not going to figure it out)

Almost every single missing child including Asha and the kid in Minnesota who ran away to kill himself (there's a bit of Occam's razor to that one, but there is some weird stuff)

Joan Risch

The family with the SUV and the dog and all the money in their truck that all turned up dead (I can't seem to find this one, but most people think it was Meth related, I am not sure)

There's also another one with a boy who goes missing while camping http://www.insideedition.com/headlines/17295-mystery-deepens-over-2-year-old-boy-who-vanished-in-the-woods (most likely the parents, but there's a lot going on there)

The Oh Shit case

The guy who goes into the bar and never comes out.
  How does The_Donald feel about Jews?  [removed]     I have this pet theory that Nick and Eddie (from The Dark Tower) are one in the same. Just thought I'd share.

     Maura Murray got drunk, got into a caar accident and died in the woods.

The rest of my favorite cases are not so easily solved, I don't think.  Has an American president ever cancelled press briefings before?       Sexy.      Whatcha drinkin?

Does Obama really have a big penis?  Here is a picture of my cat, Muffin Top. May I please have some karma? Had to start over because someone was harassing me over not liking his book.       Glue caviar.

It kind of looks like one of the collectible mini sculptures you could get at Fortunoff.     Must have been amazing.     It's humanity.     Worst? The_Donald. They mock the idea of ""safe places"" while creating the ultimate safe place. Outoftheloop has some great mods, I have submitted stuff that didn't get posted because it had been posted before and they were nice and pointed me in the right direction without being bitchy about the repost.     I'm OK with it. Things happen. The again, I am older. I am now to the point where Mother's Day hurts because I can't have kids.     This is kind of amazing. I have always wanted to kind of roam around Mexico, but I hear it's not safe and I don't speak the language.  What subs are great for browsing when you're bored?       Love the privacy, wish that did that here for Sushi.     Taverns in RPGs are always so cozy. Like In Skyrim, they are my favorite part of the game honestly.     I saw it on a special or 20/20 or something like that, they felt they had demons.

http://listverse.com/2014/11/29/10-unsolved-murders-with-strange-links-to-the-occult/      :O) I am glad I could help.     Dang, no one's happy.

https://youtu.be/G_QlkfNtX9s     Not so much a question as some advice. I have 42 now and back in high school I had my heart broken by friend and boyfriends alike. Then after I graduated and started my life none of it mattered.

Stay strong.      What about the planted animals bones, or alleged planting of animal bones.     That's the thing with all big cases Ripper/Zodiac/ONS, the people who did it were nobodies. So even if they were found, it would still be underwhelming. For me anyway. But I am addicted to twist endings.     What? I never heard a theory like this. Asha Degree?     No but I wish I was there, with some books and some wine.     I also imagine a dick that size may be painful.     It can, it gets easier.     Yeah but when will it end and how?     Compared to Mandingo my arms and legs are small.     Having a big dick is more of a state of mind, in my experience.   Ugh! I hate this thumbs up/down thing.  [removed]  i have an issue with numbers, especially large ones and I can't get my brain to even do this. I just need to know what percentage 4.5 million is our of 7.5 billion is?  [removed]  Me IRL       Lol yes!     Here you go, this video came out today and covers the case, including the magic angle, well. Weird it came out today.

https://youtu.be/vS6QJoagFKA     It did, still has some uses. And some biases.     There's one I'm really hazy on, I am really into unsolved disappearances, but I seem to remember one case where someone claimed an Africa American boy,who was autistic maybe, was kept in a basement and then reported missing. There was speculation on the charley project that the child did not exist. 

I really need to start writing this all down.     It's going to make a helluva book. If we can still print books that is.     Yes, that's a Twilight Zone episode right there.  Poor man.     https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/39y11g/last_thing_heard_by_his_parents_was_oh_shit/

There you go!     School stopped. Once school stopped everyone vanished, not in a bad way, it was just natural. I realized how stupid I'd been. Then it just stopped. I had my moments after that, of course, but all those people who talk about being friends forever in H.S. and all that shit, it's not true. Once you leave school and start your life or college, focus on that, you'll see how easy it is, get away from the toxic people, focus on your life and poof, you're a new person if you do.     Not well. I drank or smoked pot when I could, never did my school work, I was suicidal for most of my school years. I hung on to people who used me for sex or whatever, people who made fun of me behind my back. Basically, just trying to keep myself alive day to day. If i knew then what I knew now, I wold have shaken all those toxic fake ass friends off and threw myself into my studies. I regret it all wholly.  ",0

So i've been an IT apprentice for about 8 months now. 
First my company sent me to take the ITIL cerification, wich was hard.

Im getting really worried about this Server exam, it seems to be so freakin hard, and i see people saying they practiced for 11 Weeks, and 5 hours per day. I just can't do that and my exam is not 11 weeks away at all.. :(

Does anyone have any tips on how i can practice? At work i have a Server i can use to for Labs. I took the 5-day course but i didnt really pick up what we went through since its so much to go through in just 5 days :( 

I still have the 13 Module doc from the Course. Wich contains insane amounts of info and Labs.

Can anyone help me? :)     I didnt like season 2 at all, the 2nd arc was the worst     Thanks i'll still use that site all the time tho      well.... it's Naruto     Hahha yeah i agree     SAO Season 2     I always use Kissanime     For me, The anime does not HAVE to have insane animation, as long as its got a cool storyline thats not retarded and is unique. Im not a fan of the ""Cute school girl eccchi anime"", i Like the animes with awsome badass characters, fighting, crime, mysteries, epic shit thats exciting to watch.

I've tried watching a couple ""Standard Anime school girls"" series, and i Just could not enjoy it. I forced myself to finish them, they even make me cringe. Some of it is just plain stupid to me.

But thats just me, i know alot of people enjoy these, but i cant.      Is the FPS good at 1080p? :)  [question] Logitech 930c for ASMR videos?  I was planning to buy an Logitech 930c, but i was wondering if it can record at 60 FPS on either 720p or 1080p?

And when its at 1080p, does it at least record in 30 FPS?
I will also be buying a Blue Yeti because the mic on the camera is probably bad.

Any help is appreciated! :) Thanks!  Logitech 930c?  [removed]  Please Help! Logitech 930c or 920c for Simple youtube videos??  Hey guys,

Im gonna start making videos for my channel again, but i need a new camera. 

I was thinking of the Logitech 930c since im on a budget and i dont really need the best of the best.

But i was wondering, can the 930c record 1080p with 60FPS? Or does it have to be 720p when recording with 60FPS?

Thanks!
  [Request] Draw my Anime character!  Hey there! I've had a character in my mind for so long, and i've designed this charcter over a long time, in order to become awsome! The big problem is, that i can draw at all :(

Thats where i need your help! Anyone out there who can draw Anime characters! Now to explain my characters Personality (If it matters): His name is Hinoru. He is a quitet calm man in his 30's. He travels the world alone. He enjoys strong alcohol and smoking his pipe. Not too many people know who he is by appearance, but his name has made its way all across the world. He is said to be the strongest man in the world, but noone really knows, since no human knows how his power works. Noone who has fought him have ever lived to talk about it. He is not a bad person. He travels in order to destroy evil, not just your every day evil like bandits, etc. Real hell evil. Vampires, sadistic murder clans, etc. He saves small villages from evil creatures and people. He never takes credits for doing any of this, he never asks for anything in return, he simply leaves. 

Now that you have a small image of what kind of dude my character is, this might help you draw him(?). Now over to the appearance, i have taken inspiration from alot of my favorite characters from different shows when constructing this character in my head. Here is a link to an Imgur album i made, wich contain all the characters i have taken inspiration from, and so it could help you draw my character: 

Imgur Album Link: http://imgur.com/a/JAGzt

I really want to buy a custom drawing of a character i've had in my mind for years. I can fully describe the character and i am willing to pay for a drawing. I've been looking around on sketchmob and other websites but im having trouble choosing an artist! So i was hoping someone here could help me! :)

What i want:
My Character with a Weapon, clothes, etc.
A proper drawn backroud (A bar or some fire from a battlefield, etx).
Might wanna include an extra character from a show.
The drawing might need to be a bit ''Sexy'' not very important! :^)
Anime/Comic Style. Custom anime styles are also cool.

Does anyone know where i could get this to the best price?
Thanks! :)     Thanks bro! :)
I have been mainly collecting Norwegian masks but none of them were on display in this photo other than the Norwegian M39 (Bottom right).
     Facebook one. The GMCC is the good group and the GMCG is just full of idiots tbh, and the Steam group is made by some peopl from GMCG.     Please do! Any collector is VERY welcome! :)     Well it's a Private group so your normal friends would not be aware of what you are posting. And everyone in these groups are awsome cool dudes! :)     GMCC = Gas mask Collector's Community

Probably the best Gasmask group on the internet if you ask me. The greatest collectors are gathered there.     HAHAHAHAHAHA jeg sitter p jobb  dr av latter lmao     Thank you so much!

Thanks!      Im from Norway, so not too much ''rednecky'' shit around here. But i went to Alaska in 2015 with my brother and my dad, and two friends from the US. We had set us up at this camping place, and i was about to go to sleep. Then this HUGE black pickup truck with exhaust pipes sticking up on each side comes up and park oposite side. Two guys come out of the truck and put their shotguns on the truck and then they take out like 10 cases full of beer and they just sit there and drink beer and fuck around with their guns, and they left the truck running the whole damn night...     What I did back when i was in school, I'd go upstairs away from everyone else (or at least somewhere you can be alone), and i would put on some cool nice music in the background and i would write down simple goals. For example ''In the first 30 MIN i should have learned this'', and so on. Maybe this could help you? :)  18M Tips for losing weight!  Hey guys,

Im a 18 year old guy from Norway and i really wanna lose some weight now. Im a what i would call a big guy, im 117 KG or 258LB, and im 1.89 CM tall.
I try to go to the Gym twice a week, but im not too hard when i go there i usually have a light workout. In late 2014 i was 104 KG or 229LB, and i was pretty shocked to see how much i had gained over the past 2 years. This scares me because i didnt even really notice. I have no health problems as of now and i dont have any physical issues. All i really want to do is at least get back top 104KG/229LB, and i wouldnt mind going past lower than that. But I though that would be a good goal to have. I dont really eat too much shit outside the weekends, my mom makes homemade dinners and i tend not to eat too much. My main problem is how much i Drink. I hate eating infront of my PC, so i always end up drinking soda or chocolate milk, etc. I try not to drink soda during week days but sometimes i slip. Chocolate milk and stuff like that ''feels'' not so unhealthy even though it is, and i end up drinking it more often. 
I also work in IT so getting in shape is very important since I sit still alot! :( 
Does anyone have any tips on what i should do to improve? I know i have to start out by eating and drinking properly and cut down on unhealthy drinks! :/     hahahahahah     If you get noone to draw it for free, i advise you to check out sketchmob.com
Someone there would be able to draw this cat! :)     I will:)     Thank you for your interest :) , but i've already got an artist for this project.     Ahhh that sucks! Hope you'll find a better job!      uhm..... what?     Ye sorry forgot to include that :/     Hey dude! My hobby is CBRN equipment collecting and thats prety fun! Learning about these pieces, making articles on them and making videos on them is really fun! I've made alot of new friend over the interent thats into the same hobby and its so fun! Im not sure if you're into that but if you'd give it a try maybe you'd like it? :)     Thats awsome!     Thanks dude! :D     Will do :)     If i manage to buy it i'll upload a video of shooting it:)     Thanks dude, think im going to buy it.  Need help to identify this rifle! Thanks! :)       Yeah i agree with you, its definetly a Maxim but without the armor plate.
Would make sense to be a captured one! :)     Great photo, that a Maxim 1910 they're using?     Thanks everyone who showed interest in this! Im so happy for all the response! Thank you! :)     Your style was actually really cool! I think it could fit well! Could you send me a mail or message me here on reddit? :)     :(   [Paid Request] ''Project Hinoru'' Help me draw the ultimate drawing of my character!  Hey guys!

This will be quite a big project (at least i think it might be), cause there is alot of details that i want into this drawing. 
I want a drawing that includes this:


- My character
- Background
- Extra character


The style should be Anime/Comic or both, im open actually open to any style as long as I feel like it could work, so please
hit me up with your stuff! :)


So to give you a good idea of my character ''Hinoru'' here is the whole text i made when i was getting him drawn:


Hey there!


I've had a character in my mind for so long, and i've designed this charcter over a long time, in order to become awsome! The big problem is, that i can draw at all :( 
Thats where i need your help! Anyone out there who can draw Anime characters!
 

Now to explain my characters Personality (If it matters):


His name is Hinoru. He is a quitet calm man in his 30's. He travels the world alone. He enjoys strong alcohol and smoking his pipe. Not too many people know who he is by appearance, but his name has made its way all across the world. He is said to be the strongest man in the world, but noone really knows, since no human knows how his power works. Noone who has fought him have ever lived to talk about it. 


He is not a bad person. He travels in order to destroy evil, not just your every day evil like bandits, etc. Real hell evil. Vampires, sadistic murder clans, etc. He saves small villages from evil creatures and people. He never takes credits for doing any of this, he never asks for anything in return, he simply leaves. 


Now that you have a small image of what kind of dude my character is, this might help you draw him(?). 


Now over to the appearance, i have taken inspiration from alot of my favorite characters from different shows when constructing this character in my head.
Here is a link to an Imgur album i made, wich contain all the characters i have taken inspiration from, and so it could help you draw my character:


Imgur Album Link: http://imgur.com/a/JAGzt


Now to the details:


Body shape: Hinoru is a average tall man, he is not extremely tall but he aint short either. The 3rd Kazekages body shape is pretty much perfect, but Hinoru would be more muscular.
Eyes: I always loved how the 3rd Kazekages eyes so these are pretty much perfect. (And yes the black around the eyes can be added too).
Scars: No visible.
Hair: The 3rd Kazekages hair also fits good. would be nice if it could be a bit more thick.


Clothing:
Hat: No hat.
Jacket/Coat: I love the 2nd Mizukages kimono, i would love this but with different colors. Black with white stripes.
Under Jacket/coat: Just add some simple dark grey T-shirt or something, i dont really like the 2nd Mizukages dark green sweater. 
Pants: I like the casual 4th Kazekage, his pants would probably work fine. 
Shoes/Legs: I would like Hinoru to have Luffys sandals and the ''Bandages'' stuff at the same place as the 4th kazekage has it.
Gloves: No gloves.
Scroll: I would like him to have a big scroll haning from his back like Jiraiya has. 


Weapon: I would like him to have a Bisento like Whitebeard has. Adjusted to his size ofc.


Power: His power is the same as whitebeard. 


Use the pohots from Imgur as help and ask me any question :)
Whoever does this for me will have my thanks for ever! I will make sure to spread the name of the artist so others will know how good he/she is ! :)



Now that you have gotten to ''know'' Hinoru, it might make it easier for you to draw him! :)
Now im not too sure how i want the drawing to be, so here is all the scenarios i can come up with, and you could give me your thoughts on wich one would work best! :)


1. Hinoru sitting quietly at a bar (Bar is pictured in the imgur album), he is holding a small glass in his hand and a bottle of
vodka is standing next to him on the counter. In the back is the whole bar in flames and a big part of the walls and roof is missing, and in the middle
of it all stands one of the extra characters looking at Hinoru smiling.


2. Hinoru is swingin his Bisento against the extra character, blood is dripping from his face and his clothes are torn up. Fire and stone is everywhere.
The extra character is laughing/smiling and preparing a counter attack.


3. The extra character is holding Hinoru down. Hinoru is bleeding and is tired and bleeding. The surrondings is not too important here,
but it would be nice if it was inside the bar or in the woods.


4. The extra character is hugging Hinoru, he is staring into the air with a serious look in his face.


5. Hinoru is destroying the extra character with his power. (Whitebeards Power), he is swingin his fist into the extra character, 
creating cracks in the air and destroying everything. 


Thats some of the scenarios i've thought of, maybe you can come up with a better one?


Im willing to pay for the drawing! Would love for it to be around 1920x1080 so i can have it as my wallpaper, and in a high quality so it wont look bad.

Here is the link to the Imgur album containing all the extra characters and other refrence photos:

My E-mail is: haakon-rinor@hotmail.com

Plase send me a mail or comment on this post if you are willing to do this for me! Thank you so much! :)     Thanks dude, your art is cool but not what im looking for sorry :/      Also, never leave your mask in direct sunlight! That kills them, and also Moist and Warm conditions will kill your masks after a while.     I dont do too much to them, but for example, when i see a mask has cracks from dryings, I rub some coconut oil on the cracks to keep it from cracking even more.

Also Olive Oil is a good way to ""refresh"" the rubber especially when they are dirty! :)

Infant masks can be difficult to get but they pop up from time to time, pretty sought after. Im not really into them but i know alot of collectors who has them. 

And we are also usually into Civilian masks too, i just purchased a Korean Civilian mask! :D 

I found the M72 Launcher in the attic LOL, they dont seem to be too expensive here in Norway, but im not sure where you can find them elsewhere, since I heard that they are now ilegal to sell in Norway.

The shoes are supposed to go over a soldiers boots, so they are hard to setup without those boots, so i ended up messing it up a litlle bit :/     I think i started back in 2013, and the first mask i got was a czechoslovakian M10M! :) My masks are from all over the world, Norway, USA, Canada, Germany, Russia, Korea, UK, Poland, and more countries :)     Thanks :)     We love the History behind these Items, and its an interesting type  of equipment too, its the only thing that can save you from Gas attacks! :)     Hey dude,

There is alot of other Collectors, we have our own facebook group called ''Gas Mask Collectors Community'' wich we share info, etc! :)

Sad part is that the community is flooded by Non-serious collectors who barley care about it at all, so many weird ppl who just have a super small intrest. So there is alot of shit in the group but the few people who actually post serious stuff and collect for real are awsome!

And yes, most of us that collect masks collect other types of gear. We are not just interested in Masks, we also want all the accessories for them! :) 
We also love getting chemical suits too. 

Also fun gathering all the parts of a military kit from, for example The Vietnam war. you collect the whole Uniform of a US soldier and all the correct equipment and you can display it with your mask (The correct mask ofc)! :) 

You'd be suprised to see that there actually is alot of people collecting gas masks, at least i were when i first joined the community :)  My Gas mask Collection! Around 45 Masks and a ton of extra stuff.    Army Surplus Stores  Hey guys im interested in some Army surplus stores. Hopefully one that has Gas masks and stuff like that. I mainly collect gas masks (yeah i know its weird af, fuck off) and i've Been to Mad Mans army surplus and Manhs Surplus. Any other good shops? :) Thanks!     Thanks guys, I've given up hahah, not anything to go to without being 21 :( Just gonna have to survive. I'll get drunk as soon as i get back. Thanks guys!!   18 in Vegas  Anyone know of a place in Vegas tjay does not check ID? Like a pub or Club whatever. Im from Norway and i drink alot of alcohol and Im so annoyed with the 21 year old rule. Any help?     Thanks, I will! :)     never     i'll die     That looks fun! :)

     Lmao im ready for some heat     Thats sounds fun, I'll check it out:)     Looks cool! Thanks! :)     That sounds cool, thanks :)  What can an 18 year old Norwegian guy do in Las Vegas?  Im going to Las Vegas 1-9 January to attend the CES convetion with my Brother and my dad. Im from Norway and i've never been to Las Vegas before. Does anyone have an Idea what would be cool to see and do? Im 18, so i wont be able to drink over in the US. Im open to do anything, so if you know of anything cool beside CES going down in early january please let me know! :) Thanks!     What a cute couple of prostitutes     lmao     Thank you! Im sitting at work sipping Tea for the first time in years right now :)     Thanks for the tip, i Made a plan on what to eat last night and today is the first day of following it! :)     Thanks, i will start doing this :)      Well ofc its up to date, but I can just go ahead and delete this post, didnt get much out of it anyways     Chrome     Thank you, do you know of a couple of cameras that could fit for this task? Sorry for asking so blunt, but I really dont know too much about cameras :(     Sorry im new here,

But when i clicked ""Ask a gear buying or simple question""
the page just crashed and i could not post anything...  Need some suggestions for a camera that can take close up photos.  [removed]     Thank you! :)     Hva faen er dette syke jvler  IM PISSED!  [removed]     Its not bothering me, its just weird.     I see why you feel down bro.
I also feel that if I dont do anything with someone for a while that friendship just vanishes. Its not easy but you should stop focusing on how depresse you are and just try to not think of it too much. If all you think about is sad stuff, you need to do more stuff that makes you happy! 

Try out a new hobby? Go to a convetion for something new, and meet new and interesting people? :) You never know where you'll meet new friends, but my advise to you is to try something really new, something you've NEVER tried before.

A few year back I got into Gas mask collecting (Weird i know hah) but even though this was just a Group on Facebook I was in, i got to know alot of awsome people, and i even met one of them in Oslo (Im from Norway) in 2015, wich was epic! 

You need something to do that can put your mind at ease! :) 
And if you feel like your just a random option to her, then really dont hang with her. Hang with someone that makes you happy!

I'd hang out with you haha.

Hope you'll get better bro! 3  [Free] Would appriciate if someone could colorize this for me. Thanks!       Holy shit  https://imgur.com/gallery/lyGLo       Its weird, I've never done anything on his FB page at all, i just liked and watched the shit he posted.  Min-Liang Tan Blocked me from commenting on his facebook page??  So a while back I suddenly could not comment/like or send messages to Min-Liang Tans facebook page.

I dont understand why? Has this ever happend to anyone else?     Hahah np, bro :)     Yeah i thought its a cool sub, I love making new outfits in GTA, its just really fun for some reason :)  My Current GTA Style! Whats your thoughts? :)       Check out Gas mask Collectors Community on facebook! :)

My oldest is a Norwegian mask from 1934! :)      I see your pain dude :(
Hopefully you still got back into collecting! :)     All your masks?
- Did you leave them in direct sun light?
- Did you store them in moist warm condition?
?? :)     Thats really cool! keep it up! Do you know other people who collect these aswell? Im into Gas mask collecting, and i didnt know there were people collecting them, but then i found whole groups for it on facebook!
     Beautiful collection! How old are some of these? How long have you been collecting? :)     Really interesting collection! How long have you been collecting? How did you get into collecting these? :)      Yeah, I'll probably stick with this for a good while! :)     Yeah I though it couldnt be helped, but its no problem, i kinda wanted the sight anyways haha. I didnt buy it for collecting or something like that, as i said just a simple rifle to go shooting, and get back into hunting. 

Maybe I'll buy a more expensive/ more nice rifle later! :) 

Thank you for the help dude, really appriciate it!     Alright thanks guys.

I know this post is probably shitty for the community, and im sorry about that. Guns are really not my area. I know you all have your inside jokes here that takes a while to get used to, i know all about that since im part of another community where i've been for years.

I just needed help with the rifle since i wanted to know a bit about it. Not very important to me if its raped or not, i just wanted a simple rifle to go shooting with every now and then. 

Anyways, thanks for the help.     70 bucks     At least i'll take good care of whats left of it.     Just bought it since it was cheap as fuck and i need a cheap simple rifle, thanks!     I like living dangerously     Love these photos  Need help identifying this Rifle. I've bought it and its on its way to me, but this is the photos the seller sent me! :) Thanks!       Cool, didnt really buy it for colelcting, i just got it cheap off some dude and I wanted a rifle to go hunting :) 

He said the rifle was modded at some point and fitted with a scope.

Thanks dude.     A repro? Who made repros? 
I'll provide pictures when i get it.
Im still waiting for it to arrive hahaha     Okey thanks   Need help identifying a rifle! Thanks! :)       Woaw, thanks for the info! 
Appriciate it!:)  [Paid Request] Need someone to draw me sitting on a Norwegian WW2 Tank!  Hey guys,

Im looking for someone to draw a artwork of me sitting on a Norwegian L-120 Landsverk Tank from WW2! :) 

I looking for someone with some kind of cartoon/anime style, it does not HAVE to be one of those. I will consider every style! :)

Here is photos of the tank: http://imgur.com/a/uzd8t

I will provide pics of myself to whoever i chose to work with :)

Though:

Me sitting on the tank with a rifle on my shoulder. 
I would like to have some pouches and maybe a backpack on me too. Also i would like a cigarette to be drawn in my mouth, like a victory cig.

The Tank will be standing in a field with a forest behind it, and i would like there to be some fire and some devastation around the field and on the forest. 

I would like the picture to be at least 1920x1080 in size, so i can use it as a wallpaper! :) 

Message me or leave a comment if your interested! :D 
Also i need to be allowed to use the artwork for my website.

Thanks!     I will! :)     We'll be playing mostly CS:GO, League of Legends and Heartstone! :)  [EVENT]Setting up for our anual local LAN-party in Norway!

Threw in a subwoofer and some new speakers wich made it pretty nice. Also very litlle rust! Picked this car up in Amsterdam last year and drove it back to Norway! ;D     Lol, thats really a long time, 100 % sure i'll sell it within 2 years xD  Logitech C922 or C930?  Hey!

Im gonna get myself a camera for doing informative videos on my Military collection items. (i collect gasmasks, helmets, etc).

Wich of these camera would fit best? 
I've heard alot of good stuff about the C922 but the C930 is newer? 

Anyone know wich one is the ""best""?     Hahaha damn, decided to keep it

Its my first car and i've had it for 8 months.

I want to get a 2007 Volvo V50, cause i miss the comfort in new cars.

But for som reason its so goddamn hard for me to sell the car. Im always torn between selling or keeping it. Like, i would love a new car and it feels great when i think of the new car, but i become so sad when i think of leaving my 190 to some random person :(

Does anyone have any tips on how to deal with this?      I dont think i can buy Crush cream soda in Norway ",0

*D-day     Have you seen this short film, called [2+2=5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHAuGA7gqFU) ? I though it was a reference to that.      If you read the whole thing, props to you - it took me at least an hour to read that. 

It's funny, how we react much more to stories than statistics. Say, if I told you 10 million Russians died in the Eastern front, you probably won't react much. Ten million is too big a number for us to comprehend. But if I told you for every step you take from the Soviet border to Moscow, 10 people died, now that's a different perspective. Same goes if I showed you the diary of a soldier. 

I wasn't very sympathetic towards the Japanese in the atomic bomb issue. They deserved it, in my opinion. But this article shifted my perspective. It showed how human suffering is universal, whether they deserve it or not. I still believe the atomic bomb was the best solution to defeat Japan with the least number of casualties, but that doesn't excuse the number of civilians killed. A nessesary evil, I guess.     You know those industrial grade ear plugs for working in loud environments? I use them while vacuuming, and every time I take them off there is a brief sensory overload. Everything seems so loud all of a sudden.  Once I took them off outside, and I can hear the wind rustling leaf and grass, birds chirping in the distance, the distant sound of a car motor; all these background noises that I wouldn't have usually heard seemed so clear and sharp. Unfortunately my superhearing usually only lasts for a few minutes before things go back to normal :(     This is an article from the August 31, 1946 issue of The New Yorker. A really nice long report on what Hiroshima and it's aftermath was like and how people responded to it.

Yes, they shouldn't be ignored, or you end up with shit like this:

Of course Elon and Stalin are totally different people, the point is you can't use an end result to justify the  suffering of many people.

Do not assume that he who seeks to comfort you now, lives untroubled among the simple and quiet words that sometimes do you good. His life may also have much sadness and difficulty, that remains far beyond yours. Were it otherwise, he would never have been able to find these words.""

If you need anything, I'm willing to help, or listen.     True, that. But conspiracy theories are always fun :D     Interesting tidbit, Apple's logo was once rainbow coloured before they switches to silver. A theory is that Steve Jobs was paying homage to Alan Turing who played an important part in decoding the enigma, who was basically the father of modern computing. The guy was gay and died from a cyanide poisoned apple (he was also a chemist), but ppl suspected him of suicide because being gay wasn't accepted back in WWII. So ppl think the original Apple logo was a nod to Turing's homosexuality and how he died.     Get a punching bag and punch it whenever your angry :D     Either drawing or origami.

Big cities are usually more competitive, people are more stressed, suspicious and less likely to chat. Most of the time people are too busy to bother with you, they just want to mind their own business, and we see so many ppl every day, smiling and chatting with everyone would just be tiring.

I wouldn't gauge how rude people are based on how big the city is, on average people are about the same, you see a more diverse spectrum of society in a big city, so you're bound to have more unpleasant encounters. I'm living in a high tech area right now, and even though it's a fairly big city, most people here are really nice.

imo, to put it bluntly, how rude an area is depends on the average education and income level.      Oh yeah, but it's not your fault, it's just how cities roll.

If you go to a school in a eastern country, there is the same pattern you see in the West. There is an equal amount of students with bad grades in the West and East. It is true that eastern cultures place more emphasise on academic achievements, but I think there is a more important reason to this stereotype. Due to the nature of immigration processes in the West, you can only immigrate if you are smart or rich. Thus Asians seem to be averagely smarter, and seem to do well even in poverty, but it is because their parents were allowed in due to having a high level of education. The reason Asians tend to have high marks is because only the smarter, or richer, or the ones that have more connections are allowed in, and that is not representative of the general population.

The hotel you mentioned is called Nishiyama Onsen Keiunkan, it has been around since 705 AD. There is actually an older company, also Japanese, a construction company called Kong Gumi, it has been around since 578 AD. The thing is, it liquidated in 2006 and now operates as a subsidiary of Takamatsu. Depending on how you define 'operating company', answers will differ. So I don't know.

Correct, a more concise definition would be ""an idea, behavior, or style that spreads from person to person within a culture"".

Correct, the other one is the flag of Indonesia and Monaco.

There's a thing about being alone and there's a thing about being lonely, and they're two different things. I was alone but I was not lonely. My background was as a fighter pilot in the air force, then as a test pilotand that was mostly in fighter airplanesso I was very used to being by myself. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I didn't have to talk to Dave and Jim any more ... On the backside of the Moon, I didn't even have to talk to Houston and that was the best part of the flight.     Your best story so far :)     Yes!     EXTRA INTEREST ADDED!!!     Poor Mr. President.     Will there be a part 2?     I think it is a flashback, and the story is working its way to the present.       Hmm, here are my thoughts on this. I found agario around February, and absolutely loved it. Never got more excited about a game in a long time. 
  I was aware that even then there were teaming issues. I didn't really see a significant increase in teams, but I've noticed that more and more people seem to complain about them.
   The trend I did observe is that the mood of the game changed. Players are more skilled, more hostile, and more aggressive.
   Right now I sometimes appreciate teams, good solo players are hard to find, and teams give me a good challenge... and its fun to see them try to kill me.
  I have to admit agario isn't as fun to play as before though. I think I just got bored.     I have no words... How long did it take you to make this?     Try your hand at audio books. It is easier to listen to someone talking than to read a book.     At first glance I suspected the bottom one is a picture, and OP is messing with me.     Part 2?     Love the ending, I was dreading an alien invasion...     This made me think of another quote: ""Some people spread happiness wherever they go, others, whenever they go.""

 how our own pasts and memories affect our relationships with other people

That's something I thought about too. Memories and experiences, not names or titles, define a person. I would be much more worried if I can't remember what I did with my family than if I forgot my name.

 nobody will relate or understand, that what I think happens to everyone really only happens to me

""Oh really?"" He turned around and stared at me with steel eyes. ""Then why have you asked for a parley? Couldn't Brutus the Brave storm the capitol and conquer the throne?""

""You know as well as I why we're here to talk,"" I answered. ""Your defeat is inevitable, I do not want to spill unnecessary blood. Step down peacefully, and we shall spare the lives of you and your family. Refuse, and this will be your end.""

""Rubbish! Tarquin spat. ""You've spilled more blood than anyone can measure, you've sent thousands of men to their doom! And here you are talking about unnecessary blood?""

""It is the people's will, they chose to go to war,"" I replied. ""We will give you two days to consider the offer. If you have no answer by then, we will attack.""

His eyes narrowed. ""Oh you can have my kingdom Brutus,"" He hissed, ""but over my dead body. I will not surrender. This is my final decision."" 

""Very well,"" I nodded. I started towards the door, accompanied by my guards. ""I will warn you Tarquin: When the time comes, let go. Nothing lasts forever. I will still send a messenger two days later in case you change your mind.""

The capitol fell after two months in siege. Tarquin was found dead in his bedroom, a dagger through his heart. The empire became a republic, with Brutus as one of its consuls.

It's the only tree on this hill, and this is the only hill overlooking the town. The sun is setting, painting the roofs of the houses below a brilliant gold. He cupped his chin and sighed, drowning in faded memories of this place. 

""Its been so long.""

""And you've never come back?""

There was a rustle of leaves, as Rachel jumped down from the tree and sat beside him.

""No. I guess I wanted to preserve my memories here as a child. If I come back here as an adult, things will change.""

He was reminded of why he left in the first place. An eager, young boy, sick of the dull life in the valley, itching to go out and see the world. So he took on an apprenticeship with a merchant that traveled around the land. His mother burst into tears when he told him, begged him not to go, fearing she'll lose her last son. But his father agreed.

""He has come of age Maria, and he needs to chose his own path to walk.""

On the day of departure, he walked to the top of the hill, turned and waved to his family, and never looked back.

After a few years war broke out, and he was forced to flee to a neighbouring country. Then soldiers blocked the borders, and the roads leading home.

He wandered the lands as a travelling merchant, meeting many people and hearing many tales. He was always keen to hear those that origined near his hometown.

The war had finally ended, and the borders were opened again. He had not heard from his family in a long time. He hesitated, and then convinced himself it was better not to return. His home is here now, and that place should remain a memory. He didn't admit it, but there are truths he didn't want to find out. Months pasted, then years, and he found himself forgetting about his birthplace, busying himself with his daily tasks.

Now a worn middled aged man, he decided to come back. To be more precise, Rachel decided for him.

The sky is starting to fade purple, and the first stars are coming out. The windows down below started spilling warm, yellow light.

""Don't you want to go and meet them?"" 

""I don't even know if they're still there."" Some truths should remain hidden, at least for now. He wasn't sure he could face them.

""Come on. We didnt come all the way out here just to go back."" 

She tugged on his arm. He didn't move.

""Let's go."" He stood up, but to her dismay, started walking in the opposite direction. Seeing this town peaceful, intact was enough for him. Maybe next time. 

""But.."" She started to protest, then thought otherwise.  

She looked at him thoughtfully for a while, then sprinted to catch up, as their shadows melted into the twilight.

A child's first name used to be either a family chosen name or the name of a saint.

Later people gradually replaced the baptismal name with another chosen name, and that's where we are now.     So, past paper is more expensive but better?     For me, juggling languages just seem fun, especially when you're with someone who can understand all your languages. Some languages are better at expressing emotions and feelings, there are also idioms and proverbs that cannot be translated. 

Sometimes I only know a technical term or concept in one language, and feel too lazy to translate it. Other people in this thread also mentioned secrecy, using a different language to prevent people from eavesdropping. Mostly it's just because one language is better than the other at expressing what we want to say.     Anglophones are the ones who call people from the Netherlands 'Dutch'. They refer to themselves as 'Netherlanders'. In old English Dutch meant 'people', or 'nation'. People from Germany and The Netherlands were referred to as 'Dutch'. It is also why Germany calls itself 'Deutschland'. I guess the name stuck after all those years.     Only 8% of the world's currency is physical, the remaining 92% is all digital.

While trying to clean my vape today with some iso i think some got stuck in there. When i tried to vape i turned it on the lowest setting and it heated way to quickly and got way too hot, burning my tree:(. What can i do to dry out the vape and hopefully return it to use?      There are two movies that fit this description perfectly: Stand By Me and Talladega Nights:The Ballad of Ricky Bobby. Two of the funniest movies that really never get old.     is your name really sam travis? did you ever work as a camp counselor  at a soccer camp in kansas?      Hey Reddit I appreciate the fame! that is me! My name is Kieran- I'm 16 years old and I'm on the far left bottom corner of the picture!     hey I'm the kid who organized/made the banner along with one other student!     16 year old white male. mommy and daddy won't let me go get drunk with my friends on New Year's Eve. damn them    16 y/o looking to invest, or something??  Hey PF long time lurker, first time poster. I'm a 16     y/o and I've had a job for a few years now. At first I blew through lots of my cash income, but recently turned around and started saving. I have about 500 dollars in precious metals and will have 3 k expendable cash by the end of the summer. looking for some suggestions on what to do with investments other than just let my
money sit!     is this in New Jersey??     haha good one dude! you're so original and funny!       l  Arkansas Law Change  I know something with legalization changed in arkansas. Was wondering if i could have a simplified version of what changes are being made      I'm in english class and deep down I knew it was a bad idea, but why pass up a picture of boobs.         California?      meta     cool ass picture       now i'm gonna go watch and episode     crazy that you all went to the same exact highschool      fuck yes mini ents, 2005 stick shift   Questions about my new surface  I got a microsoft surface 3 (i7 8gb/256gb) for Christmas and I love it! Just two things concern me- battery life and over heating. I've heard great things about the battery life, but while I'm using it I seem to get only around 2-4 hours out of it. Is this normal? I'm sometimes coding, and occasionally gaming on it. I  read somewhere that the first week is full of updates that drain battery, is this true? 
Finally, the back, top right corner gets hot/loud sometimes. It is usually when I doing something like gaming, but I still was curious as to if it normally gets that hot.
Thanks in advance!     just moved to a different state and i'm in the middle of high school. the little shack my friends and i always smoked in (shed behind my friends house that was attached the garage and his parents let us fuck up)  had this tray in it. thanks for the moral boost      finals start next week, hours and hours of to do for them and lacking motivation:/       Holy shit dude what's up! you know your shit! never expected to get this detailed of an answer.

subject1195,"    I like your optimism, kid! Hope that's the case.      She was on my ballot in PA - Stein is on the ballot in 45 states, I believe.      Booooooo. Not cool, North Carolina.      Cool link! Looks like Clinton is leading in every state so far except for PA at the moment, where Trump is slightly ahead.      Nice! Where in PA are you?      I keep reading reports of massive turnout in Philly and Pittsburgh, especially among black folk. Good news for Hillary, hopefully. :)     Glad to hear of huge turnout in Philly - especially among black folk. Good news for Hillary. :)     Here's hoping! *Crosses fingers*     Voted this morning for Hillary in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania shortly after 7. Every parking space was full, and the line was out the door. I waited in line for 40 minutes - by far the longest line I've been in to vote. No issues, though. :)     I voted!     Just voted for Hillary in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania. Every parking space was full, and the line was out the door. I waited in line for 40 minutes - by far the longest line I've been in to vote. No issues, though. :)     So it begins, the great battle of our time.      Lol, you wish.      I think you're in for a big surprise tomorrow, dude.      I'd argue that Hacksaw Ridge had a pretty solid opening - I think it will have great legs and a good hold this weekend (especially since Friday is Veterans Day).      Niiiiiice. If Hillary wins all three of those states, I'm pretty sure Trump is toast.      Pennsylvania is looking good for Clinton - I'm happy to see that, since I live there. :)     I'd argue that many of these kids are much more mature than Trump and his supporters.      Lol, Trump supporters are so fucking pissed right now. It's beautiful.      Noooooooooooooope.     Looks very promising for Clinton!      Ain't gonna happen, kid - you're in for a huge surprise on Tuesday.     Yayyyyyy, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend stayed steady! :)     Fantastic number for Doctor Strange. Marvel's incredible (and critically-praised) run continues! 

Very good number for Trolls.

Pretty solid number for Hacksaw Ridge as well - looks like Mel's back. This will probably have incredible legs since audiences are apparently loving the shit out of it (plus the Oscar buzz and critical acclaim is going to do wonders for it).      [Go out and VOTE everyone](http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/81d6ba4237/holy-sh-t-youve-got-to-vote?short_id=aphh amp;_cc=__m___ amp;_ccid=false)     Wow, this is beautiful news. I can just imagine the look of shock and disbelief on Trump supporters' faces if Hillary wins Florida in a landslide.      Wow, this was amazing and fucking hilarious. Bravo, Rachel Bloom and everyone involved.      You keep thinking that, buddy. I think you're in for a big surprise on Tuesday.      Daaaaaaamn, son.      The Good Place dipped to a 1.2, but that's still good enough for a NBC sitcom these days. 

Yayyyy, Supernatural rose again!     /r/the_meltdown      https://imgur.com/rzfh5y5     Lol, no.      Those numbers are awesome for Clinton.      Looks promising for Clinton! :)     Damn, yes to legalizing marijuana is super close there. Here's hoping it passes! :)     Looking good for Clinton! :)     That's freaking huge for Doctor Strange. I really hope that this does $90 million+ this weekend.      A $90 million+ opening could be in play now. Lesson: Never underestimate the Marvel brand Disney's excellent marketing machine.      I'm very happy to see Supernatural rise - this season has been a blast so far.

Nice to see The Good Place at a 1.4 (even though its number is almost certainly inflated). Hope it doesn't adjust down by too much when final numbers come out.

Pure Genius is DOA for CBS - that's a terrible number.      Oh, I see - thanks, man! :)     Do you have a link to the polls-plus forecast? I can't find it.      North Carolina and Florida are light blue again on 538! Fuck, yeah.      Reuters, you give me hope, buddy.      North Carolina is light blue again on 538. Nice! 

Update: now North Carolina and Nevada are grey on 538, which means toss-up, I guess?      Yep, Eichenwald tweeted a hour away saying his Newsweek story will come out tomorrow and it's ""one of my most important stories pertaining to the election."" 

I gotta say - I'm pretty excited to see what it is (especially if it's damaging to the Trump campaign).      Wow, that's extremely close in Georgia. It would be pretty awesome if Clinton somehow eked out a win there in amongst a sea of red states.      Thank God - that's a major win against the Trump Intimidation Squad.      Phew! *Breathes huge sigh of relief*      Damn, that's a huge number for the final World Series game. I'm very happy for the Cubs and their fans. :)

The CMA Awards did very well considering the enormous competition - ABC must be happy.

Series-low number for Survivor, but that has to be expected since it was airing against two hugely watched events. It should probably have a big recovery next week.      Wow, I would so love it if Clinton somehow wins both of those states by 15-20 points in the end. The Trump campaign would be absolutely dumbfounded.
     This one showing Hillary leading nationally by 8 points: http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-poll-idUSKBN12X2P6     As Tuco once said: ""Tight, tight, tight."" But I think Hillary will one this one in the end.      Trumpsters and those from /r/The_Donald are downvoting this thread since the poll aggregators and many state polls in key swing states still show Clinton leading over The Orange One (and with a vastly greater chance of winning) despite the FBI e-mail investigation and Wikileaks. 

You should have seen the poll megathread from 3 days ago when it was downvoted to 0 points. The amount of butthurt and delusion on display is truly astounding.      That latest Reuters/Ipsos poll has me feeling really hopeful about stopping The Orange One. I will sleep soundly tonight. :)     Niiiiiiiiice.      Lol, why you mad tho?      Noooooooooope.      So will the mainstream media (CNN, Fox News, etc.) be showing the press conference for this live? I sure hope so.      Still terrific for This Is Us - even against the ratings behemoth that is The World Series! NBC must be ecstatic right now.

Too bad about The Flash reaching a series-low - it should recover with its next episode most likely.

Glad to see Agents of SHIELD remain steady. :)     http://imgur.com/7drHiqr?r     I'm really glad Timeless is getting a full season - hopefully the creators give it a satisfying ending just in case it doesn't get renewed.     Niiiiiiiiiice.     http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/?ex_cid=mobilebar v=1     Oof, bad night for a lot of shows. I'm guessing that trick-or-treating and Halloween parties had a significant effect? Here's hoping that Timeless and Supergirl recover next week.      The poll source link is in the article and is a highly-rated pollster (rated B+ by 538) and has been pretty accurate in the past. I'm just following the subreddit rules, folks. :)     Regarding Jason Statham, I just wish Lionsgate would make Crank 3 already. The first two movies were a fucking blast.      It's going to be big - I'll go with a $80 million opening weekend and strong legs.      New series-low for Quantico - wow. I'm pretty sure it's going to be cancelled, even though it does have high Live +7 ratings.

Huge for The World Series as usual.      Yep, it's pretty great. It's often pretty terrifying, with some excellent cinematography and acting as well.      Lol, no.      Final weekend estimates per Deadline: 

Top 11 films per studio-reported figures for the weekend of Oct. 28-30:

1). Tyler Perrys Boo! A Madea Halloween  (LG), 2,299 theaters (+39) / $4.6M Fri. /$7.8M Sat./$4.3M Sun/3-day cume: $16.7M (-41%)/Total B.O.: $52M/ Wk 2

11). Deepwater Horizon  (LG), 2,054 theaters (-774) / $638K Fri. /$954K Sat./$508K Sun./ 3-day cume: $2.1M (-38%)/Total: $58.36M/ Wk 5     Damn, that's got to be embarrassing for Sony - their franchise film is beaten by the second weekend of a Madea film. I'm guessing they're relieved it's already made bank overseas. 

Great second weekend for Boo! A Madea Halloween - best second weekend drop ever for a Madea film. Very impressive.      The reprise of last season's ""I Could If I Wanted To"" was especially wonderful in this episode.      Be sure to join us at /r/crazyexgirlfriend for weekly episode discussions.      Really? Well, hooray! :)     I'm just glad that Crazy Ex-Girlfriend stayed steady - especially against The World Series. It dipped in total viewers, predictably so against the baseball behemoth. Hopefully it recovers next week. *Crosses fingers*

Great for The World Series as usual - tonight's game should be big as well.      Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone in a musical that's getting amazing reviews? I'm sold. I think it will do pretty well - maybe it will bring in some of the same audience that made Crazy, Stupid, Love. a hit (they had incredible chemistry in that film as well).      It's still pretty crazy that it's making less than half of what Angels and Demons made in 2009, but that's what happens when you release a sequel seven years too late, I guess.      Ouch, that's really terrible for Inferno. I guess Sony should be slightly relieved that it wasn't enormously expensive, and at least it's doing much better overseas for them.      They're fucking amazing.      Any bets on what the RCP poll average will be by Tuesday, guys?      So when will the first polls that include the fallout from this factored in come out? Monday or Tuesday, I guess?      Yayyyy, The Good Place!     Lol, what a dick. No wonder he's polling at 1% among African-Americans in Pennsylvania (my home state).      Clinton camp, you can go ahead and release the Trump N-word tape from The Apprentice any time now...     It's very nice to see both Superstore and The Good Place both rise from last week's numbers. :) Hopefully they adjust up or stay steady when final numbers come out.

     So is anybody else here besides me super excited to see Doctor Strange next weekend? It's getting some terrific reviews, and it currently has the highest Rotten Tomatoes score of all the Marvel Cinematic Universe films (96%).      ADAM SCOTT!     The lie detector cube is super cute and hilarious.      Those Live +7 ratings for Timeless, The Good Place, and Agents of SHIELD give me hope that we may see an additional season of all three shows .

Here's hoping that NBC and ABC take these numbers into account when deciding whether or not to renew them!      Hopefully it recovers next week. *Crosses fingers*

I wouldn't worry too much - it's already received a full season order, and it's a fucking BEAST in Live+7 ratings. I think ABC is pretty damn happy, especially considering it's in a 10 pm slot on ABC (where many shows have flat-out bombed), and it's doing far better in that time slot than its shows in the past.      Well, fuck! Man, I hope that this is good.      Daaaaaaaamn.     Niiiiiiiiice.      Terrific number for The World Series game - FOX must be really happy. 

This Is Us held great against the game as well - NBC really has a huge hit here.

I'm glad to see The Flash and Agents of SHIELD hold steady. :)     /r/shield      Timeless is still falling hard in its second hour - falling from a 1.6 in its first half to a 1.2 in its second. Things aren't looking great for it, unfortunately, and NBC still hasn't ordered a back-nine. I think the chances of a second season at this point are slim-to-none, which is too bad because I like the show. :(     Double dumbass on you!      Bye bye, Quantico!      Damn, dude is the Nostradamus of our times.      Superb number for Madea - look at that per theater average ($12,212). Very impressive.

Solid enough numbers for both Jack Reacher and Ouija - I imagine that they will both hold well next weekend. 

The Accountant had a pretty nice drop, too - shows that audiences are really liking it.     I'm going to go with 15.5 million viewers, 7.1 18-49 demo rating.      Counterpoint: I honestly thought it was a blast (Stanley Tucci and Tommy Lee Jones are both amazing in it, and Joe Johnston did a great job with the film).      Bad news, guys - this show premiered to a series-low 0.2 18-49 rating and only 539,000 viewers. :( Let's hope that the critical acclaim and award wins mean something to The CW so that we can get a third season.

Also, it was up against the Hamilton documentary on PBS last night (which probably did pretty well, considering it was the #1 trending topic on Twitter when it was airing). I hope the ratings either rise or stay steady in the weeks to come.     Damn, that's a really impressive number for Madea. 
     Noooooooooooo! Damn, that's disappointing. Hopefully, it will increase in weeks to come, or The CW will say ""Fuck the ratings!"" and keep it airing due to the critical acclaim/awards factor.      I'm very sad to see Crazy Ex-Girlfriend open lower (only 539,000 viewers? Ouch). It's my favorite show, and I was hoping for a third season. :( 

Here's hoping that with the Netflix deal and the unique nature of The CW that it will get another season - especially with all of the critical acclaim it receives and its Emmy/Golden Globe wins.      This fucking sucks - hope Fox hires on a good director with a love for the source material (and who works well with Ryan Reynolds)!      I'm very sad to see Crazy Ex-Girlfriend open lower - it's my favorite show, and I was hoping for a third season. :( Here'a hoping that with the Netflix deal and the unique nature of The CW that it will.

The Exorcist received its best ratings since the pilot - people are really liking it, so maybe there's a small chance it will get a second season.      Damn, this fucking sucks.      This is exciting news. More Adam Scott is always a good thing.      *High-fives you* That's forking awesome.     Relevant username - nice! Be sure join us at /r/TheGoodPlace for weekly episode discussions as well.     I'm really happy to see The Good Place adjust up. :)     Decent number for Rocky Horror - I wasn't expecting huge ratings for it, since it's always been a cult thing.

Sad to see The Good Place and Superstore so low. I can't believe the former has already gone fractional since it's so fucking good. :(

Hopefully they both recover next week. *Crosses fingers*     Agreed - this is going to be big.      OH, SHIT! ""I'm not supposed to be here.""     She's back! :)      Be sure to join us at /r/crazyexgirlfriend for weekly episode discussions.     Agreed - that's a very good number for Lethal Weapon.      Damn, this looks incredible. Way different than I expected.      WRONG!     Well, here's the shitshow that we were all waiting for.     You're the puppet! Lol      Damn, This Is Us is a beast - beating The Voice once again!

Sad to see Agents of SHIELD reach a series-low - I hope that ABC gives it a fifth and final season, much like Fox did with Fringe.      Yayyy, Timeless is steady! Unfortunately, it dropped from a 1.8 in the first half-hour to a 1.3 in the second. Who knows how it will perform next year without The Voice lead-in? If it averaged around a 1.3-1.4 next year, I think NBC might be happy (it looks like a pretty expensive show, though). 

Very good number for Supergirl - it didn't drop too much from the premiere. I'm sure that The CW is happy. And, hey, at least Jane the Virgin matched last season's premiere.     Considering that Deepwater Horizon had an estimated $110 million budget (with probably a $30-40 million marketing budget), and it'll probably end up at $60-65 million domestic...yeah, it's definitely a huge bomb for Lionsgate. Heads are going to roll for this one.      Why, God, why?     Be sure to join us at /r/crazyexgirlfriend for weekly episode discussions.      wat      Great number for The Simpsons (thanks, NFL lead-in!). 

Rough night for ABC - it's looking likely that this will be the final season of both Quantico (which has now gone fractional) and Secrets and Lies.      The movie was PG-13, actually.      Yep, I have a feeling that Moonlight and Fences are going to get a lot of Oscar nominations instead in order to avoid the ""Oscars So White"" criticism from last year.      Donald Trump     TV Tropes     It's in its 12th season now, and it sounds like they want to get to at least episode 300 (which would be in Season 14).      I'm just hoping that the terrific Crazy Ex-Girlfriend does OK when it returns next Friday. *Crosses fingers*     Very good number for The Accountant - I definitely wasn't expecting it to do $20 million+     Supernatural continues to remain incredibly steady - it's still a lot of fun. I'm catching up with last season on Netflix now. 

Too bad about Legends of Tomorrow - maybe the villain from last season drew some viewers away? I don't watch it (but plan to), but I heard numerous people complaining about him. 

Pitch and Rosewood are goners. At least you have Empire and Lethal Weapon, Fox!     Supernatural will continue until the heat death of the universe. Its fanbase is insanely supportive, and they have stuck with it despite its many time slot changes over the seasons. Its ratings have remained steady as a rock.      Lol, good catch! The writer should have really done the research first.      Lethal Weapon's performance has been really impressive - I'm sure Fox is happy to have a solid hit.

ABC's comedy block remains incredibly solid.

Survivor continues to be the sturdiest reality show on TV - much like Supernatural, NCIS, Grey's Anatomy, and Law   Order: SVU, it should continue for many more seasons.

Nice to see Designated Survivor remain steady.

I hope Frequency doesn't drop any further.     So...Clinton goes up another 5-10 points in the polls in the next few days? I'm OK with this.      So if Clinton's lead over Trump in the polls gets even higher (say up to 15-20 points) before Election Day, will even more Republicans jump ship? Man, I hope so.      Runaways on Hulu (based on the comic book series)     Fuck, yes, it is. The show takes you on a roller coaster, and it's incredibly fun.      *cough* Nate Parker *cough*     Damn, people really love the shit out of This Is Us. NBC must be ecstatic to have a huge drama hit that's actually increasing from its lead-in. Chicago Fire did great as well.

Good night for ABC's comedy block - everything did very solid. Sad to see Agents of SHIELD go fractional, but that's not surprising.

Rough night for FOX - EVERYTHING is fractional! 

Even though that's a series-low for The Flash, that's still a good number. No Tomorrow is DOA, though - it will be interesting to see if The CW renews everything last season or if they cancel some shows.      Nope. Nate Parker is an awful human being, so I'm not surprised.      That's a very good debut for Supergirl. I hope this bodes well for the return of the wonderful Crazy Ex-Girlfriend on October 21st. The CW has so many quality shows these days, so it's nice to see them performing well. 

Be sure to join us at /r/TelevisionRatings for more excellent ratings discussion and analysis as well.      This is incredibly disappointing and disturbing news, especially since I was always a fan of Devin's writing since his CHUD days (he was always controversial in his very outspoken views). I will continue to read the site, though, since they have some great writers (like Meredith Borders and Brian Collins).      Very good start for Supergirl - I'm sure that The CW is very happy.

Hopefully Timeless settles around a 1.3-1.4 - I think it's pretty fun so far.      Source?     Nope, I think Tina Fey wanted 30 Rock to be Home Improvement in terms of the huge ratings it got, which it never did.      Be sure to join us at /r/The_Exorcist for weekly episode discussions.      Huge (as expected) numbers for the second debate.      Daaaaaamn.      EXTREEEEEEMEE VETTING     Oh, boy.     Wow, Birth of a Nation did very poorly. I think Nate Parker can kiss those Oscar chances goodbye.      Oh, what a lovely day!      Lol, Trump is so fucking screwed. I can't wait for Monday to see more Republicans jump off the Trump ship.      Niiiiiiiice. The shitshow continues!      Source?     So any idea on when The Apprentice tapes will be released? It would be amazing if it's tonight before the debate.      Wow at MacGyver's quick demise - it is pretty likely to get cancelled now, I think.

Poor The Exorcist - it's so damn good. I wish Fox would move it to F/X or something, or some other network would pick it up after they inevitably cancel it.      Trump is cancelling his rally tonight, according to CNN. Lol      Wouldn't it be great if both Cruz and Christie unendorse Trump next?     Source?     Lol, this is the beginning of the end.      So what's the count up to now?     Good number for The Girl on the Train - it won't be the word-of-mouth sensation/zeitgeisty film that Gone Girl was, though.      This is absolutely beautiful. Behold: the collapse of Donald Trump!      This is AAAAMAAAAZING.      Be sure to join us at /r/The_Exorcist for weekly episode discussions.      This show is really fucking good - unfortunately, it's more than likely to be cancelled at this point. The last episode received a 0.6 18-49 rating, which is terrible for a show on a broadcast network. At least we'll get 13 well-made episodes, hopefully.      What a shitty fucking apology that was.      We can only hope. *Crosses fingers*     They're seriously taking about the possibility of Trump dropping out right now on MSNBC. Wow.      WOO HOO!!!!!     Source?     Geraldo Rivera is actually making some sense on Fox News right now - he's saying the Trump campaign is in an ""existential crisis,"" but O'Reilly is trying to downplay it all. Wow.      Niiiiiice.      ""The Republican Party are flipping out right now,"" according to CNN.

BEST. DAY. EVER.      CNN is now playing the remarks in full for, what, the 10th time now unedited (except for fuck)? Lol     CNN just reported that Bush's campaign manager said, ""This is disgusting. I'm voting for Trump.""

It's going to be beautiful to see how many Republicans jump off the Trump bandwagon now.      This story is at the very top of CNN.com now, and all of the profanity including ""fuck"" and ""pussy"" is UN-EDITED. I've never seen that before. Wow. 

Can Trump really be done after this?      I love how this story is now the #2 trending story on the Apple News app - these remarks are being shown everywhere except for Fox News, I guess. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if this event alone (along with Trump's probable disastrous debate tomorrow) makes Clinton go up another 2-5 points in the polls nationally (where she is already up an average of 4-5 points nationally). 

Trump, I think you're fucked.      I love how this story is now the #2 trending story on the Apple News app - these remarks are being shown everywhere except for Fox News, I guess.

Good fucking riddance.      Man, Trump is so fucked. Lol      Looks pretty damn cool - much darker than I expected. Loved the Buffy shoutout, too!     This actually looks pretty damn good - much better (and darker) than I thought it would be. I loved the Buffy shoutout, too.      Nice to see The Good Place increase! :) Such a great show.      I'm really happy to hear that Frequency is quite good (I loved the movie it's based on). I imagine that if it maintains around a 0.4 average, it will probably be renewed, especially since The CW renewed their entire slate of shows last season - even the extremely low-rated - but wonderful - Crazy Ex-Girlfriend.      I wish that Frequency had premiered better - I hear it's quite good, and I plan on checking it out. The movie it's based on is one of my favorites.

Trying to enjoy dark souls agin now but honestly realizing that it merely pretends to be everything the Witcher was in lore, story, role playing, and combat.      Holy shit I thought I was the only one. Punched a mirror cabinet when I was angry after finding out a girl was cheating on me and scratched my arm up (scratched, not cut). Between that and my terrible mood and not wanting to talk to anyone, Doctor interpreted it as a suicide attempt. Cue being told I can either sign myself into institution or be forcibly confined to a ward for six months. Choose the first and had to lie and pretend I had been tripping out on Ambien I found in the cabinet because they didn't believe I was ""just angry"" and were hanging that 6 month stay over my head if I didn't comply. Was there for most of a week until I actually met with the psychiatrist and he said I was 100% fine. Still worried that medical record is going to bite me in the ass someday and keep me out of a job or something.      And thank God that people are finally realizing Religion is bullshit.      Alright you've all convinced me to give it another chance. I must have let my bias prevent me from looking at the work fairly when I read it years back.     Literally all that book was about was rich people being self centered assholes. The entire novel was basically just an episode of the Kardashians. I really don't get how anyone could find its one dimensional characters ""enthralling"" but then again, people *do* watch the Kardashians.     As an EMT: getting old REALLY sucks and you really need to enjoy your life while you're young and be as compassionate and giving as you can possibly be, because when your 16+ hour workday is primarily helping over a dozen random people who can't even sit up on their own and will be dead in a few months, you're forced to confront the ugly truths you'd usually like to avoid.  Jason Isbell: Relatively Easy (acoustic Americana/blues folk/country)       As an EMT I can attest that in the US, they cannot take you by force if you are an adult unless you are a convict, in an altered mental state, or declared to be dangerous by police. If they forced you to go, that's kidnapping.      Literally had this happen every other time I would run that shortcut back in the beginning      American Hustle.

Alright, can we please just decide on a damn meta level already?  So since I get answers ranging from 80 to 100 to 110 to 120 to 130 to 150 and so on, can someone please tell me where I need to stop leveling in order to get summons? I'm trying to work out my build but honestly I'm afraid I'm going over the meta level for most PvP players.
Edit: I'm mostly just wondering what level I need to be to get the most connections. I don't want to be running around and never getting summons because I'm in the wrong bracket      Yeah that's something I forgot, the charging port. Granted this seems to be a universal tech problem. All my old phones bricked after the charging ports eventually wore down. Had to position my first controller a certain way to get it to charge  Help with DS4 battery life and sticks peeling/not responding to forward input?  So this is the third controller I've had, which doesn't see any throwing onto the floor or other abuse that should cause it to be damaged, and yet they all only seem to hold a charge for maybe a couple hours at a time (ex: I just charged mine for an hour, came back, played for a couple, and it died again), and more importantly, the rubber on the sticks peels off after minor usage, and eventually the left stick won't respond when pushed forward (which basically renders it unusable). Given this is not the first, or even second controller to give me problems, is this a common experience? How do you usually compensate for these problems?     I remember those two, they took a couple days or practice. The problem I'm finding here is that the lack of dodgability from her attacks and the fact that she's phasing through pillars completely as opposed to simply attacking through them, coupled with the fact that the lock on mechanic isn't functioning during this fight, is what's making me question if something is wrong.     Stats in order:
Lvl 94, Hollow 99

I've been trying to maintain a build that mixes bleeding with great chaos fireball as a basic ranged attack and miracles to buff, to see if I can mix a bleed/faith build. Works thus far, only found a roadblock at this fight.   Honestly **** the Dancer of Boreal Valley  This boss is completely impossible. I don't know if my copy of the game is bugged but holy crap there is literally nothing I can do to this boss. I've tried bleed, I've tried lightning, I've tried pyromancy, and while I can do damage, there is absolutely no way I can not be hit by her combos. If she does a grab while I'm using a melee weapon with Carthus Rogue/Lightning enchant, I can't roll away from her, as if I roll left, right, or back, she still connects. If I happen to get out of the way in time, she always defends her flanks by a three hit slash, slam, slash combo or some variation that always manages to land a hit if you dodge the first part of it, as she follows up by doing an attack right where you dodged to. So I tried to keep her threaded around the pillar, only she can not only attack through these pillars with perfect accuracy and *just* the range she needs to do a double stab attack, but she can even walk right through the pillar itself and double tap me dead with one of her slam/slash combos that I can't dodge away from. It doesn't help that when I try to bleed her with Dorhys' Gnawing, the lock on mechanic won't trigger, so I have to free aim when she is standing right on top of me doing some manner of combo that I won't be able to dodge if I cast the spell. More often than not, my character will stop, spin around, and fire the spell in the complete opposite direction, then proceed to get pounded into the ground. This game hasn't been a cakewalk but I don't know what I'm supposed to do with an enemy that can close distance instantly, has too many combos to make a greatshield or dodging viable, can attack behind herself, and can both attack and walk through the pillars I am being told she shouldn't be able to get through, and where the lock-on mechanic that lets me hit her with spells absolutely refuses lock on, and free fires in the most arbitrary direction. 
Before I just give up on this game, what do I try next? None of the strategies I've been offered work, and given that she doesn't merely attack, but actually walk through pillars, and is immune to the lock-on mechanic, I'm wondering if I'm perhaps bugged.     Well it's in regards to Sam himself saying that reality is limited to consciousness. He spoke of this in the End of Faith podcast 1. The notion I'm encountering is the idea that this means that consciousness is a predicate for existence, and that science can never address or solve the mystery of consciousness. Furthermore, if consciousness is a predicate, this would mean some form of consciousness has always existed. Can we still reconcile this with atheism if true, or can Sam refute these claims and further explain his notions that he spoke of in the first part.     This is at the very least provisionally related, certainly it is to the book itself. He actually spoke of this already himself in the first podcast. I was wondering if he could further elaborate on how this idea of consciousness as a predicate to existence might relate to the topic of the book:atheism. Specifically, can he refute it or justify atheism if we claim there must always have been consciousness? Maybe Sam would not see this as pertaining enough, and would rather answer it elsewhere, or find it boring, but I'll stand by my opinion that it's related, and leave it to his prerogative.      Can you please comment on the biggest dilemma I am personally pondering in my philosophy undergraduate pursuits: the information theory of the universe and the notion that reality only exists so long as there is consciousness to perceive it, and how to reconcile this notion with athiesm or outright counter the notion?

For some possibly needed context: the theory (as explained to me) is that science cannot assert anything about a reality outside our consciousness, only what we appear to perceive. Given this, we cannot truly say that there are objects separate from us that we are witnessing; you yourself say that our outside experience and our thoughts occupy the same ""space"". Thus, I am facing two notions: reality does not exist without consciousness, and thus there must always have been some sort of consciousness, and that there is not an ""outside world"" but rather a two dimensional plane of information that we conceptualize as the three dimensional reality we perceive. Can we counter the theory that existence requires consciousness and if not, how must we look at the Big Bang from now on? Is this a problem for atheism?     Thanks for the reply, meant a lot. I owe you a few drinks sometime.

D D? Seriously? I knew there was a bit of geek floating around in there, haha!= If you ever want to play again, I'll dig out my old gear, wherever it is. Some of the best nights of my childhood were spent in the Forgotten Realms, fighting mind flayers. 

I hate those damn things...     Hey Ben, I hope you wont mind if I get this sappy shit out of the way before I ask you a question, but I think its worth saying, even if I hate getting emotional. Skip to the last bit otherwise.

Your music has been a huge help in getting through some tough times, and Ive seen my fair share, from abuse as a kid to just plain bad luck and stupid choices. The past few years Ive gone from letting it drag me down to letting it turn me into a not-so-great human being. Ive done a lot of things I regret in those years, and still struggle with kicking the booze and cigarettes. 

However, listening to your stuff give me something to identify with and made me feel a hell of a lot better, in fact I think it gave me an outlet in music that kept me from doing some really permanently stupid things. It even got me to try my hand at it myself (which is arguably bad for everyone that has to hear me, haha) I guess Ive taken to idolizing you and the guys; I dunno if thats weird, but hey, its how it is.  Ive been to many of your shows in Boston these past few years and weve talked each time over smokes. Last time I was there during the Seat of Our Pants tour I kind of imposed upon you and shared my gratitude and trouble with you, especially concerning recent heartbreak and the coming death of my father (which came just a couple months later). Let me tell you, I havent had more than a few genuinely supportive figures in my life, but your understanding and empathy really meant a lot to me, even for those short moments, and I thank you for that (you even carried out a request for me, which was awesome). That and my regret over not letting my father die with a better image of me really gave me a kick to the ass about getting my shit together, or at least care enough to try.

As far as a question, Id just be fine knowing about your hobbies outside of music, or whatever plans you have for the future. You guys all seem to tour endlessly, but you must have some things you like doing outside of all that. Games? Reading? Politics? Other Music?

(P.S. See you in Boston in October! You better play some of this awesome new stuff.)
  I'm on the run but you NEED to listen  I don't know where to begin

Long story short, I'm a med student. Or, was.

I was accepted into a research program with some important people. I don't know why, I'm not the perfect student, but I guess I impressed someone. 

We were studying a pathogen of some sorts that one of them had found out. It's remarkable. It's seemingly a common cold variant, so obviously it's a widespread thing. Yes, you might have it.

Why should you care?

We were studying this pathogen after one of the heads of the project picked up on something weird- a lot of convicted murderers had this new pathogen floating around in their system. I don't know how to explain this quickly, but it seems that the pathogen wasn't just a cold virus- it's attacking the brain. Most of the people that get it (there were a couple of people that had it that didn't display any personality change) would start to become increasingly violent and irrational. Nothing anyone tried had any sort of effect on deterring this. It was like it was physically changing the brain pathways. 

The thing is that the people who had it for long periods of time were becoming more and more dementia-ridden and crazy. Some of them even died from it. Autopsies seemed to show that it's working almost like Alzheimer's- it's....breaking down parts of the brain.

I'm running out of time, I'm sorry, this is incoherent. Shit.

Look, when they found out what this was doing they decided to do tests on other people. I thought they simply already had it, but I found out that they were actually GIVING it to people that didn't already carry it. They had plenty of people to test it on:this is a some sort of common cold-level infection- a lot of people probably have it. 


Obviously I protested this. The experiments were just getting too shady for me. The implications are of course troubling, but at the time I wasn't going to just sit back and let this shit happen. 

I was promptly sat down in an office surrounded by several men and told that I needed to shut up. That's the polite way of saying it at least. I don't know what the hell I'd gotten into, but all these guys that I was having drinks with before were now telling me that if I didn't keep my mouth shut that there would be consequences. ""This is a private project, it's important we don't attract too much attention. We don't want any of our findings to be lost because someone is telling stories outside of class.""

I'm getting funny looks about my appearance. I haven't bathed in a while. I should leave soon.

Look, so I went home and confided about it to my fiance. She was appalled of course, and this might seem strange but she was uncharacteristically irrational in her anger over it. She demanded I do something about it, she was absolutely livid about it. 

I think it was at this point that I realized something was probably horribly wrong. Come to think of it I had been feeling a bit off for a while before. Oh fuck maybe I am responsible.

I'm too shaky to think straight. Please bear with me.

Look, ever since I had started protesting about everything my girlfriend had been getting more and more angry and impatient with me every time I was at home. It wasn't just at home- we live in a town where there's growing crime, so it's inevitable for crazy shit to happen sometimes. But she was getting really agitated with everyone. She was put on suspension from work towards the end because she got into a fight with a man that she worked with. She just blew up and started swinging at him. He was being a creep, I'll admit and she's always been a straight shooter. It's just that she's never been physically aggressive.

Even at home she was starting to be a bit physical. I'd have to tell her to calm down and watch her hands a few times. One time we were taking a walk and got into an argument, and she just started slapping and swearing. I had to hold her arms and tell her to stop, and that's when the white knights came to ""rescue"" her. The cops ended up stopping by, and she calmed down and admitted it was her and that everything was fine. We were given a firm warning and sent home. 


The point where everything blew up was when I decided that I should try and tell someone. I started writing down everything I could about what was going on and trying to find evidence. I never did find enough- I didn't get the chance.


You might have heard about this on the news, but it happened in a city where there's a good amount of crime, and the hot topic right now is police and blacks. 

I came home and she was standing in the kitchen in her underwear. There was stuff thrown all around, and she looked like a mess. She'd been hospitalized before for being bipolar but it had never been this bad. I think I was starting to realize what was going on right about now.

I obviously asked her what the hell was going on, but she didn't say anything. She just flipped, screaming and babbling about something I couldn't even make out, I had to grab her and tell her to calm down, and that's when she jumped on me. She just turned into an animal-biting, clawing, hitting. I had to try to get her off. But she just kept-


I'm sorry, I just...

Look, I didn't mean to hurt her, but I had to get her to stop. It was heat of the moment. I didn't mean for her to hit her head. 

It's not my fault. I don't know what happened. There's so many people from all around starting to lose it. Look at the news. The world's going mad. People are rioting and killing.

She was sick, I couldn't do anything. Please believe me, it was an accident.


Look, I'm trying to get the hell out of here. I won't say where I'm going. But look:the place I come from has a lot of people. There's even an airport. It's the perfect place for a pathogen to spread. Have you wondered why people are getting more and more crazy? That Florida face-eater, the riots all over the news, the shootings that keep happening- There's something happening. People are sick. You are probably sick. Have you noticed people around you getting more and more angry and hostile?

The worst part is they know. They know all about it. I can't prove it, I don't have the means. 

Somebody has to get the news out there- you people are all sick, and you don't even know it. It might not be as bad for you as it is for others, but I swear that you probably have it. You need to get ready. If someone doesn't do something about it this is all going to keep getting worse.


This isn't turning people into zombies, it's not some joke- it's making people irrational and violent and crazy and none of you even realize it.

There were some people we looked at that didn't have it- that doesn't mean you're safe. You need to be ready.

I'm sorry, I don't have any more time. I'll try to come back. Please.


I never meant to hurt anybody. I can't get this pulse out of my head. It's like a throbbing screech. I wish it would just stop.   What was left over of a body after a funeral pyre and what did they do with whatever charred remains were still there?  I'm thinking of a traditional wood pyre where a body is placed upon a mound of wood and set alight. I know that this is a notable practice in both old Norse and Hindu culture, at least as far as I have been taught. It's also a common movie trope (the funeral of Vader in EP6 comes to mind as an example) but I doubt the movie depiction is an accurate one.

Anyways, I was struck by the thought that there must be some sort of mess to clean up. Wouldn't you have a charred husk of burnt bone? What did people from cultures that practiced this do with all of the mess?     Problem is there is no feasible way to remove these without destroying the frosting unless you sacrifice the box     That hand model has some nasty looking nails.     There honestly needs to be legislation to hold judges accountable for this sort of thing. I'm sick of hearing about these people who hand slap-on-the-wrist sentences to murderers and rapists. It's nothing short of aiding and abetting criminals, and you should answer for it. If nothing else, it's a plain declaration of your gross incompetence to handle the judicial process. 

I haven't been this infuriated myself since that judge let off the Brock Turner kid with a 6 month sentence.      Yet to be made aware of women being murdered, jailed, beaten etc. in the west for wearing hijabs. 

You can see scores of daily reports of the horrors women are subjected to outside of western society.

Why we have to insist the situations are equatable is absurd, and I honestly believe it's actively contributing to the undeniable patriarchies that exist abroad where women are treated like cattle and subject to brutal, socially condoned violence on a constant basis.  Friend wants to do 531 but has joint condition that limits shoulder movement, cannot physically lift arms above head. Any alternatives to the OH press?  My friend has a bone growth condition that prevents his shoulder joints from being able to lift his arms above his head. This is a permanent condition that flexibility exercises won't be able to fix. He has enough range of movement to do incline presses, but I'm not sure if that will work as a substitute. Does any have any ideas, or can he just not do the program?     It's Guy Love!

That's all it is!

It's Guy Love!

He's mine I'm his!

It took me a while but I finally figured it out through lots of trial and error and doing data collection. Here's what I found:

Basically, when you put your sign down, you get summoned by another player because they see a sign appear in the same location they can interact with. Some of you might have figured this part out by now.

Now once you've been summoned by another player, next comes the important part. You see, just like you, that player has to fight enemies during the course of the game (this blew me away when I found out. I can back this up with video) . This is in fact the reason they are summoning you. Most likely it will be for a boss fight. 

Now we all know bosses are scary, so your first instinct is probably to follow the host into the fight and then run in circles around the edges of the room making no attempt to actually attack the now health-boosted boss, but this is actually the OPPOSITE of what you're supposed to do. What you actually want to do is one of the following:

1. Attack the boss. You can literally do this in any way you like. Melee, magic, you name it!

2. Stop putting your summon signs outside of Midir and then running laps around the arena the entire fight.

I hope this was helpful because I know the game is really new so there hasn't been enough time for people to figure all the complicated aspects of the game.     Oh, I see.

Still, I'm well aware how it works.

Marxists start with suppression of dissent by censoring.

Later comes the Gulags, and then the mass murdering. It's the same old routine.     I'd expect nothing less from a Marxist.     Capitalism allows corruption and greed!

The only possible alternative is to reinstate a system that has killed over 110 million people and systematically led to widespread genocide, poverty, and oppression! 

After all, none of that was *real* communism. If *I* was in Stalins place none of that would have happened because I'm morally perfect and I understand the doctrine of socialism better than anyone else!

/s     Read books. Either great classics of fiction or philosophy or even poetry. Books that teach meaning.

Exercise. Get your body moving.

Go outside. Find whatever aspect of nature you can and immerse yourself in it.

Get out and experience. Doesn't have to be specific, just exist in as many interesting places as you can.

Talk to people. Be candid. Let them prove you wrong so you can really learn what's outside of your subjective mind.

Get out there, do something difficult, take on some responsibility for something, and above all, be honest, all the time. The core of life is suffering, so go make it worth something instead of sitting around praying for eternal happiness.     Did you seriously expect anyone on this sub to tell you not to? Lol.

Honestly if you get it used it can be a fun game, especially if you play with other people. I bought all of the Soulsbourne games  only after they dropped in price. I'd never pay a full $60 for a Souls game, as I just don't see them as the AAA Mona Lisas they're hailed as; too many issues that haven't been patched/fixed for me. To be fair, that's not unique to the series, it's just sort of how it goes with games nowadays. 

My only tip for actually playing is to have fun, experiment, and not get caught up in he whole SL 120 meta elite community (the ""git gud"" crowd) that likes to tell people what they can and can't play as. Just be you, and you can make almost anything work.      I'd actually love to boiled alive, honestly. It sounds pretty hot.     So am I the only person that got those tokens through PvP or what? I hate the PvP in dark souls with a passion, but I don't recall ever getting a single one of my proofs from a silver knight when I got my Darkmoon items.     Thing is, as someone who has been in a group home/ dealt with CPS, it won't be much better for them if they get taken away. It might even be worse. The state, as far as I ever saw, is *abysmal* at caring for children they ""rescue"" or putting them in good homes.     I think it was Thomas Szasz who wrote how mental illnesses don't really exist for the most part. All these things we constantly call ""mental Illness"" and insist on treating with drugs is, in reality, just a symptom of a problem in the way a person is living their life. I think we vastly underestimate the ways our mental health can deteriorate when we develop poor habits, such as our societies new obsession with constantly burying ourselves in social media and internet usage. What we mistake for mental health problems is mostly just us having really bad life habits that we don't take the responsibility to change, as opposed to some random, sudden pandemic of mental illness that is appearing out of the ether.      So how can I do that line and unlock the benefits without gaining new levels   Dark sigil in NG+  If I go into NG+, will I gain extra levels again by talking to Yoel and progressing that quest line? I'm considering my level meta and don't want to go outside of it.     They should address the fact that 60% of migrants aren't refugees but young men using the open borders to get entry into the EU. Once here, they form ghettos and routinely harass women and cause conflict due to the fact that they hold cultural values that do not match western standards. It's not a matter of tolerance when the culture in question views women as subhuman property. What we need is to focus on vetting the ACTUAL refugees and improving their standards in their camps to work towards protecting and empowering those among them who are secularist and capable of being the future Muslim secular movement that is the only hope we have of fixing the Islamist Middle East.     Way to strawman right off the bat, really shows your capacity for discourse. How about not covering up mass rapes for starters? Is that a problem for you?      That's funny coming from a country that is suppressing countless rape victims of migrants for the sake of multicultural bullshit. Great news but honestly not enough for me.

Both of those games were miserably depressing, which is exactly what I loved about them.     Look up Megan Phelps. She was his granddaughter and left the church in her twenties. The WBC very much believe what they are doing is an act of love given they believe these people will end up in hell if they don't convince them. Funny how perspective works.     Lovecraft was right.

This also counts as ""the most horrifying thing you can imagine about space""     I used to be the type to say ""if we allow human life to be ruled by reason the possibility of life is destroyed"". I was super idealistic and a romanticist. Then I got hit with reality pretty hard when I fell on some bad times and realized i was actually a egotistical privileged liar who was full of himself and doing that stupid teenager thing where you try to pretend you're the most interesting personality when you actually have no real substance to your actual self. It was just another phase, and I came to realize the I was actually a pretty boring and empty person deep down. Then I realized religion was the same thing as me: a bunch of lies and fantasies that talks itself up to be solid gold and the ultimate truth. After a stint of getting into trouble and acting like a punk to deal with what honestly wasn't a big deal in hindsight and realizing one day that I was being a fool, I stopped pretending to be something I wasn't and grew up. Along with that came a lot of reading and the realization that being as reasonable and rational as possible is the only way to live in reality. Its still not perfect, but I feel a lot better about the direction I'm going. I certainly feel like I'm being more honest, and I think that's something we should all take more seriously.

Zac Brown was amazing , even with far seats, but it was hard to hear because a third of the crowd kept screaming ""FREE TOM BRADY"" the whole time.     Yep. Sounds about right.     I never said dark souls tries to be the witcher. I said the witcher is everything that dark souls pretends to be.     I felt like the entire difficulty of Dark Souls was in its terrible controls/mechanics, but still, great design and scenery. Can't find an equatable atmosphere.      Couldn't agree less.

Not perfect, but far more engaging and enjoyable than the endless rolling around trying to avoid getting hammered into the gravel.

since i'm a big tv enthusiast and there's no where else to go to get all round serious discussions about television.     people who text while driving.     Dexter for sure. from season 5-7 was one of the biggest drop in quality i've ever seen for a tv show.       shame not a lot of people have starz so not a lot of people know about it.

actually the show has a huge fanbase. the biggest i've ever seen for a starz series. I was on twitter last summer and it's all they use to talk about on there. it's just not talked about much on reddit considering the target demographic. 

As the titled said, it's the 2nd higest rated series on premium cable.       If Legion didn't happen Jessica Jones would still be my favorite superhero/comic book based series. It isnt just for superhero comic lovers, but also for TV fans. Unlike most superhero series the storytelling is unique, its much more adult and isnt afraid to explore dark themes of sexual assault, rape and abortion and it does so with taste. The tone of the show is dark and chilling, but is also mildly humorous. There were the occasional scenes that makes you feel youre watching a horror movie, and others that made it seem like a self-aware satire of superhero tropes. Oh and Kilgrave is undeniable one of the best TV antagonist.    Bow Down to More Royal Thickness from Pleasantly Stacked Ms. Kingdom    Bow Down to the Royal Thickness of Pleasantly Stacked Ms. Kingdom        Lucifer, the best show I have ever seen.

welp. I suggest you check out some more shows, but if that's your thing I won't judge.

Good news tho. Lucifer is renewed for a 3rd season.      jessica jones for example, that show is so cliche in the dark way that to me is boring.

please don't force me to say anything against the rules here man. I'm trying to be good. 

But why in god's earth would you think Jessica Jones is clich? Well maybe het whole broke down alcoholic schtick, but otherwise Jessica Jones is an original show.      Supergirl     Season 1 - Season 2 - Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me (1992)

also, pay close attention to the interrogation scenes in season 1. It'll be interesting to see how it actually played out in the prequel film.     I have high hopes for this one, being a FX original and all.      honestly, I think a match with Brock would really help Rollins a lot right now. It doesn't matter if he loses, he just needs a match with Brock     I'm not that gay     fucking my hot cousin who looks just like my uncle     Jamaican here. we can pirate movies, music etc. without having to worry about any consequences. our ISPs don't give a fuck.       I get what you're saying, From 2013-2015 Netflix was on fire, but I also have to disagree. House of Cards, OITNB and Narcos are good yes, but 2016 was a great year for netflix shows too. Black Mirror, Stranger Things and Easy were stand outs for me. Luke Cage and Haters Back Off were fairly good too. And this year they are still striving with Masters of None S2 and 13 Reasons Why. F is For Family S2 and The Defenders are coming up soon as well. Dear White People and Sense8 S2 are subjective but many people like them as well.  Zarha 3: Black    Zahra 2    Zahra        **Bates Motel** final season proved that just like Gotham is an alternative to Batman, Bates Motel is an alternative to the Psycho film series. It wasn't perfect but it was enjoyable. [](#s ""Who would've thought Dylan would be the last man standing though? I totally was expecting him to die""). Bates Motel did not try and connect its story to Psycho at all but was able tease us along the way because many thought they would.

     ok, I guess I will. I had a similar viewing experience with HBO's Girls for the first 2 seasons too tbh. It took me some time to figure out what that show was aiming for so it was a tedious experience at first. But Girls was visually pleasing to me and that's what made me stick with it and it went on to be one of my favorites in its later seasons. That is something The Sopranos doesn't have unfortunately, it's not visually pleasing.  Does The Sopranos get better or am I too late to this party?  I finished season 2 of The Sopranos not too long ago, and after 26 episodes I'm still not finding itall that engrossing. I mean, it isn't *bad* don't get me wrong, it has some of the best character writing I've seen for a TV Show and there's more comic relief that i expected (I've laughed more times than I do for these 'comedies' nowadays). But plotwise, it isn't doing much. It's a very calm and subtle show but maybe too subtle? This is a show that is recognized by many as*one of the greatest of all times* so I keep waiting for big 'wow' moments to happen that'll make me ecstatically say ""holy shit this show is phenomenal!"" but they never come. For what it is, it lacks excitement, there's no thrill, no suspense, it doesn't make me wonder what's going to happen next. Trying to watch more than one episode at a time would result in me tuning out of the show almost completely, so the show is not bingeable which is a drag.

From watching I can see that the brilliance of The Sopranos is in the details. What characters say, to whom, where and when... it's a build up, it's precise. I know it's a groundbreaking show, and i can appreciate that. But how does it hold up now in 2017 considering there are other well-detailedTV Serieslike GOT, The Americans, The Leftovers, Fargo, Mr. Robot etc. with more added element which makes them more enjoyable? I know The Sopranoswas probably the first TV Show to break down a lot of walls. Theyhad movie-level production values, centered around antagonistic characters, showed a main character killing people in cold blood, showed a lot of nudity etc. So yea, back when it first came out The Sopranos was probably the most daring show on TV, but I feel it lost many of those attributes with time, and now that they don't have them anymore what's left? Just an average family drama with slightly overweight, mid-age Italian mobsters talking about organized crime (which wasn't visually pleasing to me at all being such a male-dominated show).For people who watched it a long time ago and rewatch it now and still love it I can understand the nostalgic feel, but for new viewers it could be a difficult one to get into.

The truth is tho if The Sopranos didn't happen a lot of the shows we have today probably wouldn't exist.Also something I've noticed now that I've watched The Sopranos, is that Ray Donovan is quitea ripoff. Tho the premise is different the family ties look very similar.But I did enjoy the first2 seasons of Ray Donovan more than I'm enjoy Sopranos right now tho, so my conclusion is that The Sopranos did not age well.     what's wrong with it being a netflix original? imo that makes it even better      my main issue with Silicon Valley (apart from not addressing its diversity issues of course) is its repetitiveness. I've watched 3 seasons of the show and it kinda felt like I watched the same season 3 times but with new jokes (that I don't even find funny half of the time). So I'm still contemplating whether or not to start the new season.   Silicon Valley's live ratings have taken quite a stumble. Is it because of the Game of Thrones delay or do people not know the show has returned?  I always wondered why I never hear about Silicon Valley anywhere else apart from reddit (not on twitter or irl), but the show always does so well in ratings. It's a very subjective show so maybe many people just left it on after Game of Thrones but didn't get invested? or maybe the new season wasn't promoted well enough so many did not know it returned? I'd like to imagine Silicon Valley doesn't usually rely on much promotion since it airs right after Game of Thrones. 

Silicon Valley average ratings for a season usually lies somewhere between **1.5** - **1.8 million**. Season 3 finale live ratings was at **2.04 million**, but it took quite a huge stumble this season and the premiere live ratings was at **0.86 million**. 

Veep has taken quite a stumble as well tho not as much as Silicon Valley. For a show that usually gets a rating of **1 million+** season 6 premiered at **0.66 million**. 

It's not confirmed but by the looks of it **Insecure** will be airing right after Game of Thrones this year. It will be interesting to see how much that will help the show's ratings since its first season had an average ratings of **0.40 million**       I'm not sure what /u/ProspectDikadu deal is but you hit the nail right on the head here. The Leftovers is also one of my favorite shows of all time and just like The Sopranos it's subtle and have well written characters. I haven't seen The Wire yet, but I think I'm moving on to that next. I definitely appreciate The Sopranos but like you said the characters just aren't doing it for me I guess.     say what!? I hate police procedurals. what in god's earth could make you think I like them. Did you actually read the post before you commented on it?      Yes. I think it might make it even better tbh. Is that even the main mystery of the show? not in my opinion.      easy, by making jokes about it.

Erlich: ""Hey, you notice how we never get any pussy? ""

Richard: ""Yea, because there are hardly any girls around here"" 

lol...ok that's not so funny but I tried my best. But think of all the possible jokes they could use to adress this issue man.       How this isn't the no. 1 comedy on TV right now is completely beyond me.

diversity issues. it's a very white male dominated series and doesn't caters to a female audience. It's a true representation of the tech industry and Silicon Valley (the place) itself. My problem is tho the shows has never ever taken the time out to address this issue not in the slightless.

You thinking this show could be the no. 1 comedy on TV despite lacking diversity is very naive of you.

     no only live numbers. Unless HBO Go has gotten a maasive uptick in subscribers I'd like to think the amount of users on HBO Go is still pretty much the same as it was last year. Even less now that Game of Thrones isn't airing   Big Little Lies is great and I wouldn't mind a 2nd season  7 episodes, A-level actors, great production values, great writing and directing; this is the treatment I wish 13 Reasons Why (which is discussed later on in this post), and all other books of this kind had gotten. Big Little Lies, based off the Liane Moriarty novel of the same title, is a slow-burner and an excellent one. Told in flashback via an omniscient perspective but framed by interrogations of otherwise minor characters, Big Little Lies possesses a clever structure and an intricate story-line. Its looming mystery is one many might find weak because it's easily solved within the first 4 or so episodes, but hiding the truth was never its intention. Big Little Lies did mystery in such a uniquely pleasing way, it teases viewers and feeds off our doubts, but concluded with our most obvious guesses. 

Big Little Lies's brilliance wasn't in the mystery itself, but in David E. Kelley's subtle writing for its characters and sharply written dialogue, Jean-Marc Valle's signature directing style commonly featuring flashing sex and surrealism, and of course the flawless acting lead by Academy Award winners Reese Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman. Shailene Woodley, Alexander Skarsgrd, Adam Scott etc. were all so great and so were the child actors we didn't expect too much from. Every character was portrayed so perfectly , some actresses even seemed like they were playing themselves most of the time (Reese Witherspoon for e.g.), and it compels you to get wrapped up in the private despair and public pettiness of these characters. For a drama centered around a bunch of 1st graders and their suburban moms Big Little Lies proved that the key to entertaining television is in its writing, directing and acting, and doesn't have to depend too much on its premise at all. Big Little Lies small town setting made for some very pleasing visuals. The cinematography, multiple ocean-waves shots, astounding soundtrack, and well paced, slow progressing story gave the series a very soothing and atmospheric tone, even among its dark subject matters. It felt like Big Little Lies just did the same brilliant episode over and over again and I can't complain. The ending came swift, didn't leave much room for much of an aftermath, and there were a few conflicts left unresolved. And for those reasons, developing a a second season for Big Little Lies should not be difficult for David E. Kelley though the it was promoted as a miniseries. We are already engrossed into these characters and their lives so a 2nd season wouldn't even need to rely on mysteries to be good. 
     just ignore the pussy joke man I was just making an effortless example  but yea, I'd forgotten about this. Still want them to address the issue more tho so viewers don't find it sketchy. I was actually having an argument on twitter no too long ago with a few women calling the show sexist. I was trying to explain to them how the show is just a true representation of the tech industry and didn't intend to be sexist at all. But to avoid more negative reactions like these Silicon Valley should make more effort in addressing this issue.

edit: grammer      It's pretty naive of you to claim women need to be catered to in order to enjoy the quality of something.

you missed my point. let me put it this way. The shows is made for a specific demographic and isn't something *most* females and poc will be intrigued to watched. Is it a coincidence that I've only seen this show talked about on reddit and no where else? no.

For a show to be no. 1 in a specific genre on TV it needs to be made for a wide range audience. it needs to be something everyone will enjoy, something that is diverse and interesting. Like Community, The Good Place, Brooklyn Nine-Nine etc. 

edit: I'm getting downvoted but I think I'm gonna stick to my argument here. As both an active member of the black community and a TV enthusiast I think I'm right here unless someone comes and convince me otherwise. Silicon Valley is not a show you'll find many females and black people watching.      why though? did u ever continue?      gotta be more specific fam. what shows are you refering to?      It can be a bit unfair at times but live TV ratings is still used as a measurement to see how many people are watch a show     he'd definitely be a jobber     i'm sorry :(   The CW 2017-18 TV Schedule. 'Arrow' moves to Thursdays. 'Jane the Virgin' to Fridays       actually, I think you're right. mmmmm.....maybe that's why I was getting downvoted.     * Magic City
* Scream Queens
* Scream - not this reboot     The Missing season 2 was the most intriguing of the lot. Everyone should see this. Great stuff (despite the sloppy ending).

subject1323,"    The original Condemned was on PC, 2 wasn't     Very insightful. These guys invading the farms have hundreds of livestock at a time when the govt. is having to buy cows and goats from Turkana and Somali herders so that they don't all die in the drought. And its really suspicious that it happens in an election year. There are definitely some politically powerful people behind this.      A lot of misinformation in the comments. 

1. Kuki is a conservationist who has done a lot for Kenya's wildlife. With the national govt. not being very keen on protecting the country's wildlife, people like Kuki have been picking up the slack and doing a lot of work to protect animals in Kenya.

2. Her shooting and the raids that have been happening in Kenya have little to do with poaching and the trade in wildlife trophies. The people carrying out the attacks are not poachers, they're pastoralists. Kenya has a lot of different pastoralist communities, especially in the Northern half of the country, who have never really modernized their culture or settled down. Some of them are nomadic, some are not. These communities include the Pokot, Samburu, and the Turkana. [These communities have been fighting each other for a long time, and the only thing that has changed recently is that they have easy access to Kalashnikovs streaming in from War-torn Somalia and South Sudan](http://www.accord.org.za/ajcr-issues/%EF%BF%BCpastoral-conflict-in-kenya/).

3. The most recent raids have occurred due to friction between the tribes and the conservationists. In a country where people struggle to hold on to land that is more than an acre in size, conservationists have thousands of acres in Laikipia county. The local pastoralists consider this to be their ancestral land and that puts them at odds with the ranchers and conservationists. They are also at conflict with  African land owners in the same area, but that doesn't get much attention. In this particular year, there has been a massive drought in East Africa and this triggered the raids early this year. But we also can't ignore that this is an election year in Kenya, and security and the economy tend to go to shit when elections come close. 

4. The government response has been kinda shit. Most recently, the president deployed the army to work alongside heavily armed policemen to deal with the situation. The result has been multiple shootings of herders and their cows, but with the pastoralists still illegally occupying land. Firstly, I don't think its legal for the president to deploy the army without parliament's approval. Secondly, kenya's police officers are dumb as shit. No, seriously, [The Kenyan police does not hire people who have a C+ or above](http://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2017/03/02/lower-kcse-mean-grades-for-cops-mps-tell-interior-ministry_c1517301).

TL:DR; It's not about poachers  The one where Pedes discussed the mating / breeding practices of a Muslim, globalist, feminist Europe  A month ago, one of the pedes over at T_D posted a Breitbart article discussing Germany's recent demographic changes following the mass immigration that recently occurred. In the article, [Virginia Hale reports that 36% of children under five years in Germany have a migrant background](http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/09/21/germany-40-percent-migrant-background/). 

So the first thing that pops up for anybody with half a brain is how ridiculous those figures are. In 2011, Germany had a population of 80 million people. For the demographics of the country to change that much over the last two years, the country would have had to take in millions of refugees. Not to mention the article itself is a mess that just screams ""fake news"" whichever way you look at it. The first thing that pops out is the round-about links that you get with fake news articles. If you google anything about ""40% German children migrants"", a bunch of the results popping up are right-wing and conservative sites that link back to the Breitbart article [Example 1](http://www.dailystormer.com/genocide-at-sonic-speed-36-of-children-under-five-in-germany-have-migrant-background/), [Example 2](https://www.amren.com/news/2016/09/germany-nearly-40-per-cent-of-under-fives-now-migrant-background/). Apparently, Breitbart are the only guys to have picked up this incredible story, as not even the German media is talking about it (Fucking MSM shills). The only source that Breitbart give, on the other hand, is an article by [Michael Paulwitz](https://jungefreiheit.de/debatte/kommentar/2016/raum-ohne-volk/). Paulwitz is a German conservative journalist who runs a paper called ""Junge-Freiheit"". The article he wrote did talk about massive demographic changes in Germany. However, Paulwitz does not mention anything about the 36% that Breitbart themselves have. His article does not even discuss children under five in any part so that is obviously bullshit from Breitbart, especially because they provide no other source. 

But all that is not even worth talking about, its just Breitbart playing their role. The interesting part is how the pedes turned this discussion into feminism, ""globalism"" and the third Jihad ( I must have missed the first two Jihads). 

So the top comment goes: 

muslims already said they plan to out breed the germans.
They tell everyone what they are going to do and yet germans accept this with open arms.
Doesn't help they breed like rabbits and each male can have several wives. 

And obviously the German government is complicit in this, as it pays the Muslims to have children. 

As it happens, the pedes' high-level understanding of Muslim ""breeding"" practices, also helps them understand why rape is so endemic in the Muslim world. 

One of them asks: 
Serious question - I've always wondered how this works. If the population is close to 50/50, do many males go without any wives if some of them hoard up all the women?

And the answer:
This is why they rape anything with a hole in their down time. Goats or young boys as long as it can be stoned when they are done they are good to go.

And please note, Muslims ""breed"". Seriously, the word breed was used at least 8 times in the comments and each time in reference to the Muslims. What do Europeans do? They ""have children"". 


The comments get even more interesting when they go into feminism and globalism.  

The first comment on this is pretty tame and actually isn't hateful or absurd
Europe has a huge problem trying to get women and families to have children. It's a problem in a lot of first-world/developed regions. As education level, wealth, and opportunities rise women (and men) start to not want to have children. This poses a major threat to the economies that run off of taxpayer dollars, no children now means no workers later, so what did they decide to do? Immigration and Gobalism. And we saw how that turned out.

However, almost everything that follows that is a total shitshow.
Firstly, Feminism is apparently one part of the problem. 

Feminism- Globalist/communist plan to cut wages and get larger workforce. Women working during childbearing years = lower birth rate. One sided laws covering divorce and custody = Men less willing to marry = lower birth rate. Single mom households = more crime. Wonderful

A problem that is worsened by women who just don't play their role. 
Feminism is part of the reason. Women working 5 to 9 jobs removes them or delays them in the mating pool.
Then by time the woman wants to have babies, its too late either because less men interested or they lose the ability. Btw, the older the woman is when she gets pregnant, the more likely the baby will have birth defects. Women working also removes them from the household and this results in their children being raised by the state more often.
Its not a bash on women, but it just seems that its not really working too well for the long term survival of a people. The other blame is responsible adults living in a high cost of living area.. while immigrants pop out multiple children and having you pay for them via taxesm

Remember women, you're supposed to be in the mating pool, not the working pool. So if you're reading this in an office right now, shame on you. 

I could go on and on and on, but those comments are so absurd, I'd end up replicating 80% of that thread here. 

TL:DR: Women destroyed Germany by refusing to mate, thus allowing the Muslims to outbreed the Germans.   Redditor on the T_D finds a 2013 NYT article claiming that chemical weapons are so horrible, even Hitler wouldn't use them .... except it didn't.  The aftershock of Spicer's ridiculous Hitler chemical weapons comment. A pede does some sleuthing and stumbles upon a fantastic find. A 2013 New York Times article by [Steven Erlanger](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/07/world/middleeast/a-weapon-seen-as-too-horrible-even-in-war.html). According to the article, Hitler abhorred the use of chemical weapons and even refused to use them himself. And so the pedes assemble. The highest comment archives the article. The next highest comment is something about the poetry of it all 

I'm starting to see a pattern here. Shit happens, Trump admin comments on it, media gets enraged, Trump admin apologize, media gets BTFO the next day by their own records.
It's like poetry. Or an eloquent waltz, and Trump is leading.

The third highest comment, though, is a winner. After much reading of the article, the pede finds: 

He literally thought they were too bad to use on civilians because of his experience with them in WW1.

But let's take a look at the article, shall we?

No Western army used gas on the battlefield during the global slaughter of World War II. Hitler, himself gassed during World War I, refused to order its use against combatants, however willing he and the Nazis were to gas noncombatant Jews, Gypsies and others.

And that is the only part of the article that talks about Hitler. It says the exact same thing that Spicer's critics have this week. Hitler DID use chemical weapons. Not to mention the argument that is there to be made about Spicer trying to degrade Assad to Hittler's level as a way of justifying the strikes last week (admittedly though, Assad is a terrible person and something needs to be done).

TL:DR; Pedes can't read for shit      why did you?     Well let's see. 
hasnt made a significant change to his system at all until the switch to a back 3 recently
failed to introduce any sort of pressing system

I don't have time to scour the web for proof but the best example I can think of was 1 maybe 2 seasons ago, when Arsenal were doing poorly around December and with a trip to City approaching, he switched to a pressing form of the regular 4-2-3-1. Cazorla was moved to a holding mid position, alongside Coquelin, where they both excelled for the rest of the season. 

failed to organise his defence in any way even with painfully average defenders

Firstly, if you think Mustafi, Koscielny, Bellerin, and Monreal are painfully average, then you're either a troll or somebody who has never watched them play and draws their football knowledge entirely from memes on r/soccer. Besides that, Arsenal's worst defensive performance in recent seasons came in 11/12, right after the last mass exodus, when they had the 8th best defense. Since then their defense has been the 3rd best in the league twice, the 2nd best once and the fourth best once. 

But, hey, who gives a flying fuck about these figures. Arsenal is shite. 
  What do you call an alligator in a vest?  An investigator     So true. I hear they still use babies as the main form of currency over there. God forbid they wisen up and switch to something more practical like paper money.      work.






























































































































































lol, jk. I checked whether reddit was back up every two minutes     Everytime I've watched Arsenal play, Xhaka's distribution stands out. Not as good as Cazorla but still quite good. Given this is his first season and a change in club level and league I think he'll get better. I'd be very interested to see how well he plays alongside a DM who gives him really good cover like Kante or Wanyama.      Cambyses had asked for Amasis' daughter for a concubine and Amasis, not wishing this life for his daughter, sent the daughter of the late king Apries.

To be fair to the Egyptians, Cambyses was kind of overreaching there, when he asked for a princess so he could use her as a whore. 

Thus ended the sovereignty of Egypt as it was annexed by Persia and, henceforth, changed hands many times before finally ending up as a province of Rome.

Amazing to think that this is how one of history's greatest empires came to an end - CATS     thank you
     What thread?
      Anything that's loud = rocket propelled grenade [source](http://imgur.com/a/vXFDk)     Not an expert but I have some knowledge of all this. 

Birth certificates, national IDs and Passports all fall in the same family of documents used to identify individuals but with different purposes. 

The birth cert. is a document that proves you exist; that you were born in a certain time and place and to certain people. These details are used to determine your citizenship, age, and, parents. It serves as the starting point of your identity in official records. All govts ensure new-born babies have birth certificates so that they can track the demographics of their population. This is one of the ways that governments are able to know the birth rates, and population growth rates of their countries. Also, when you die, you get a death certificate, which sort of seals the record that was opened with the issuance of your birth certificate. In most places in the world, you cannot use your birth certificate as personal ID, such as when opening a bank account because they can be misused easily, such as the way you just described. 

IDs and passports are expansions of your public record but with different purposes. Passport is easier to explain because all countries have them. A passport is issued for people who are travelling outside their country. You can apply for one even if you are not travelling and use it as your official ID. However, you don't need a passport and the vast majority of people in the world don't have them and never will. Also, in most countries, you pay a fee to receive a passport. This puts it out of reach of most poor people, meaning that you can't reasonably expect everybody to have one.

National IDs serve as an official personal identifying document for adults. This specific document varies across the world. Some countries issue their citizens actual national ID cards when they are 18 years old. Some countries rely on other documents such as driver's licenses and student IDs. In some countries, only the national ID can be used officially. One thing to note, most countries do not recognize IDs issued by other govts, only the passport because the standards for it are international. 

Tl:Dr; 

A birth certificate records your birth and opens your official record. you use this to get other documents.

Passport is a super ID, recognized in all countries and specifically used to travel abroad. You do not need one, if you're not leaving your country.

national IDs: issued by govts to their citizens to identify adults. They vary across the world, and are mostly useless outside your country of residence.        Why ""StewJon""? That's not even creative. He could have come up with something that's more astronomy-y like Stewdaris, Stewdarus. Or even better, ""Fuck off, Jon""     Random thought here. I was thinking recently about the end of the world, or human civilization at least, and the question in my mind is ""Will it end with a bang or a whimper?"" because the way I see it there are two plausible scenarios but we mostly seem to focus on one. 

Scenario 1: This is what most people see, including the religious nuts and Hollywood ""creatives"" a sudden and rapid succession of events cause the world to end within a very short period, say less than a year. This could be a nuclear war that causes some sort of devastating winter or an apocalyptic weather event. The initial incident destroys much of the human race and civilization. Only a few hundred thousand or million people are left behind but they die off shortly due to the ensuing disease, conflict and famine. Whole process takes 2 years max and has a very clear and distinct trigger that can be identified as the beginning of the end.

Scenario 2: A series of incidents stretched over a great period (at least a decade) that gradually diminish the stability of human civilization, reduce its population and prevent its growth eventually leading to the mass collapse of the human race and causing its extinction. This could be a series of loosely related wars or conflicts, none of which ever reaches the intensity of what most people envision in a nuclear war. Perhaps most of these conflicts will be slow and boring wars that fail to capture the interest of global viewers for long enough, preventing the attainment of any lasting solution. Then these conflicts increase the social, political and economic pressures on even those countries that arent involved. Refugees keep flooding into Europe; illegal arms keep moving into African states; the economy slows down in Asia; paranoid governments across the globe increase restrictions on civilians; angry civilians respond with mass violence and civil disobedience and paranoid govts. increase their restrictions further. This sequence of events continues until human civilization as we know it is over and the last remaining survivors are finished off by extreme weather, geological events and yet more conflict. And maybe the spark that triggered this devastating sequence of events dates back to December 2012.  
     The mimic?      I had the opposite. Once dreamed that I had a wife and I loved her very much but she died. In my dream, I was distraught when she died. When I woke up I was still sad because of ""my loss"" and I stayed sad for most of that day.       The only answer here is a stupid one so let me try to actually respond. 

The threat varies GREATLY across different countries, even countries that just neighbour each other. Lets start with the easy ones. 

The US: Extremely low risk. The threat of a terrorist attack originates from different factors, mainly the strength of the govt., location, and demographics. The US has each of these on its side. Super strong gov., very low muslim population and a massive distance from any majority muslim country. The only thing that negates these factors is that the US is the most attractive target for most terrorist organizations. Al Qaeda. ISIS, Taliban all want to hit the US but currently they have less than a 5% chance of being successful. So I would say the chances of an American dying in a terrorist attack are ~1%.

Next is Europe: Moderate to low risk. Unlike the US, Europe only has the benefit of many powerful governments and a powerful coalition of powerful governments. Besides that, many European countries have significant Muslim populations, and Europe is bordered on the East and South by large Muslim countries. The Mediterranean Sea is the only geographic barrier between them. It doesnt help that Europes recent immigration problems heightened the threat by allowing hundreds, maybe thousands, of terrorists to stream through their bodies. And while the vast majority of the refugees or migrants are not terrorists, there will be problems with their integration into European society and these problems could lead to the radicalization of even more people. With all of these, there is a moderate risk of European people dying in attacks. This risk is moderate to low in places like France, very low in places like Germany and almost nonexistent in places like Bulgaria and Slovakia, where the terrorist organizations have very low interests in carrying out attacks. Even with these risks, most European countries have strong institutions that will help prevent and deal with any potential attacks. The police, intelligence and social agencies in these countries actually work. Notice how most of the terrorists who have carried out attacks so far were already being monitored. There are probably thousands more being monitored by European police some because they already have terrorist links, others simply because they are at risk of radicalization. And, no, the worlds greatest continent will not just wither and die because France voted for a liberal banker as president. 

Middle East: Very high. And in some places, Extremely high. When the US state and defence departments talk about thousands of terrorist attacks occurring each year, the majority of those attacks occur in the Middle East. Key countries are Syria, Yemen, Iraq, Turkey, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. All of these have large terrorist organizations carrying out daily operations both within and outside their ongoing wars. People die from terrorist attacks here every day and the issue is distinguishing acts of war, purposeful attacks on civilians (this is what constitutes a terrorist attack) and attacks by the govt. Outside these hot zones, you have countries like Lebanon, Jordan, Bahrain, Oman; where the threat is moderate to low. And Iran, UAE, Saudi Arabia, where the risk of dying in a terrorist attack is very low. Notably, if you look at the three checks I used before. The Middle East lacks all three. Few strong governments, located smack in the Middle of Islamic lands and their populations are constituted of Islamic majorities. 

The Others: High to non-existent. Some parts of Africa like Nigeria, Somalia, Mali, Libya, are extremely high risk for many of the same reasons given above for the Middle East. For places like Kenya, Egypt, the risk is moderate. Countries like the Philippines, India, are low risk. Then you have places like the Oceanic countries and Latin America, where the risk is largely non-existent. 

This all focuses on Islamic terrorism. No focus on state-sponsored terrorism or attack by non-Islamic groups.
     The places where I know they have Gorillas are Rwanda, DRC, Uganda, Cameroon and (I think) the Republic of Congo. To be honest, I dont know much about the last three, but Uganda and Rwanda are pretty good. Both have a lot of wildlife, great scenery and theyre quite safe. Uganda has more attractions than Rwanda, being smack in the middle of the Great lakes region and has a couple of lakes that you could visit as well like Victoria, Kivu, Albert. I honestly dont know much about the cuisine and culture in those places though. I know Cameroon and the Republic of Congo are safe too, but I know nothing about tourism in those countries. 

Your other option, with limited time, is to choose a country with a large variety of attractions. South Africa, Kenya, Tanzania, Morocco and Algeria are all great for this, especially the first 3. With SA, Kenya and Tz, you have great wildlife, excellent beaches and natural attractions like the lakes, mountains, the rift valley etc. So you could choose one of those countries so you can enjoy a lot of different attractions at the same time. With Kenya and Tz you also have a great mix of cultures with a blend of urban western, indigenous African and Arab cultures in places like Zanzibar, Dar es Salaam, Mombasa and Lamu. 

If you want to focus on the people and culture part then Morocco, Algeria, Egypt, and Ethiopia are definitely in. They all have good cuisine, interesting cultural mixes and a lot of historical sites, especially Ethiopia and Egypt. Those four countries are, however, very light on wildlife. 

So the deciding factor is how much you want to see or what you really want to see. Different options in each of these countries and with one - two weeks you will be able to visit a lot of great places in whatever country you pick. 
     How much time do you have? Two days, one week, three weeks?     1. I guess yes...

2. Going home. Only 30 mins left.

3. The last place you kept it

4. Definitely water

5. No. She's just really disorganized and never delegates.       **Submission statement**: In early 2017, a wave of prison riots in Brazil led to the murder and dismemberment of scores of prisoners. This violence put the spotlight on Brazils powerful and violent drug gangs. Despite running transnational operations, little is known about these gangs and the way that they operate. In this article, Lessing examines the historical origins of these gangs, their structures and their effects on Brazilian society; some of which have been surprisingly positive. A worthy read for anybody who has an interest in crime and the War on Drugs.  Brazils prison massacres are a frightening window into gang warfare       Small addition: One option is to approach the business dept head (she's the main boss) and ask to branch into the business stuff a bit more. However, I'm worried that if I do that my supervisor will take this badly. It might make her look irresponsible, because she did not utilize her intern.  Help: I'm two months into a six month internship and my supervisor wont delegate.  This could be a bit long so please bear with me. I started an internship end of March working in the very small communications department of a decently large organization. Our organization works in about four countries and handles as many as 30 projects at a time. Our tiny comms dept. handles most of the work from these countries and projects. The comms. is bunched in with the business dept. We have two people in comms,.: my supervisor and me.


**More background info**: My supervisor is a friend from college and we get along well. We hang out regularly outside work and had been doing so long before I started here. She helped me get the post by putting in a good word for me, although my chances were already decent because I nailed the interview (I know because I befriended one of the people who interviewed me and she told me so). My supervisor does a good job and handles a lot of work. Even though her title is assistant there is no officer or dept head. The business dept head focuses on the business part and just leaves us to ourselves. 


**The Problem**: My supervisor almost never delegates or assigns me any work. I have moved from an intense work environment, where I was writing 7-10 pages a day (an average of 2000 words) to one where I handle as little as one article a week. This week she is away on a work trip and all I had to do was add three lines to an article I wrote last week and edit five templates. One of my coworkers gave me a small task to help her with yesterday and that was great. Unfortunately, without more training, I cant help with any of the business stuff. I have tried asking my supervisor to give me more tasks but all she ever says is no, you cant handle this, Ill just do it myself. During my interview, the main boss said that if I did well enough, they would likely hire me. Now Im worried that with nothing to do, they might not hire me simply because my position is redundant. To make it worse, my supervisor is always telling me (casually) that she has a lot of work to do. Sometimes she stays in the office four hours later than she needs to (although this has something to do with her taking a 2hr gym break at lunch). If the pay wasnt so good, I would have quit and gone back to my old job, even though I hated it. So I need help. Has anybody else dealt with this situation before? And how do I approach my supervisor and tell her to give me more work. 


PS: You might notice that the entire business and comms is a bit of a mess. Our boss is always late, rarely present and so there is very little accountability, especially in terms of punctuality.    
     Fucking ridiculous. Next these ""experts"" will tell people to prevent shark attacks by not swimming.      At this point, I have to talk to her. I'm just hoping that she'll be receptive to my situation and helps fix it.     There's very little room for initiative because of a lot of red rope with the articles we write. But I am looking to work on more constructive things with all this free time I have.     I loved the city it was based, Santa Barbara.

     https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/6bdg6v/pep_he_wenger_plays_against_everton_and/dhm0ass/     I go through the BBC frontpage as one of the first things in the morning. The story's title did not have anything about the rape accusation originally. It was just ""I acted as a man to get a job"". I didn't bother reading it. Later in the afternoon the title was what it is now, I was like ""no, fucking way"". I read it. Fantastic story about that woman's life and a happy conclusion too, so far. I guess the new title works.      In My Time of Dying and In the Light for me     World War Z. They could make it into a nice long series that covers the whole process, from breakout to recovery. The way the book goes, though, its just not possible to do it in one film      Because it's way off. Despite Trump's recklessness and any repercussions it might have on Israel's inside man in ISIS, the US remains an important ally to them and NATO countries. You still have a massive intelligence body that generates a lot of info that benefits these allies. You also have much more resources than they do, allowing you to analyze emerging info efficiently. And lastly, more than any other country in the world, you have the ability to act on intel provided quickly and efficiently. Even if Israel felt skeptical about Trump's administration and its relationship with the Russians, they'll come back to you because you have a massively powerful security apparatus and, unlike most other countries, are very eager to use it when the need arises. They could take the same info to Germany, China, UK, France, Canada, Australia, all of which have decent militaries, but those countries are far more cautious than you are when it comes to engaging targets in foreign territory. So, no, the media and a lot of other people are exaggerating when they suggest that America's allies will stop sharing their secrets because of this reckless act by Trump.     the ricin is also a giveaway. seems to be a signature weapon of theirs     You're welcome. :). I loved it too.     I didn't do it ... but if I did it, there wouldn't be anything wrong with that.      Are you sure, you're not gay?      because of the time loop, bro     You didn't even read the article. The couple was killed by Islamists, not the government.      Mali's crisis is a classic case of conflict triangulation. When you have a serious conflict in one country theres always a high risk of the war spreading to the countrys neighbours. This mostly happens because of the movement of fighters, refugees, weapons, and pre-existing political issues. In Africa alone, this has happened in Somalia (affecting Kenya and Ethiopia), Rwanda (main cause of the DRC wars, which have never ended), and now Libya. The rebels who started the Mali conflict are suspected to have fought for Gaddafi before his regime fell. That is also where they got their weapons and expertise from. So if the Libya conflict had not happened the way it did, there is a chance that Mali would have remained a stable nation.      You can still go to the press now. Your story could get a lot of traction in an election year and maybe even throw some shade on a few pigs.     An even better example is the rapist who got off easy because he was a talented swimmer.

The Kinks - You Really Got Me    Man or Astro-man? - Sferic Waves        Sweet  When did humans figure out how many of them actually existed?

In light of Etho's [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn6RbDL5bBE feature=g-u-u) on hunger it has become evident that we really do not know how the hunger system works. As an important aspect of the game, enlightenment is undoubtedly neccesary. 

Please Jeb, Dinnerbone, Jon, or even Notch could you please explain?  r/Mindcrack, you are feeding the trolls  Recently there has been much talk about the situation with Etho. That needs to stop immediately. By voting a [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/mindcrack/comments/tkhus/my_thoughts_on_the_situation_with_etho/) to the top and flooding it with comments you have given the trolls what they desire the most, attention. 

We are making the situation worse. 

To avoid further conflict I argue that we must ignore trolls who post any aspects of any Mindcracker's personal life. I call for no more comments, posts, or any talk related to this controversial topic. 

We must look towards the actions of Etho as guidance. His decision to stop comments on the episode in which he explained his profession is proof that he would like that particular discussion to end. Let us all follow his lead.

Right now I believe the future of this subreddit hangs in the balance. To ensure its continuation we must reject this unrelated information and continue to focus on what is important, the submission of community based content and discussion on mindcrack events only. 

Please take into account the consequences of your comments and posts, continuing to give attention to certain issues will ultimately lead to the degradation of this community.

As a community with a fairly large liberal base that is made up of young people its easy to see how gay marriage is widely accepted here. 

That got me thinking, one of the major arguments for gay marriage is that government should not dictate love, should that not include polygamy? 

Can anyone present a valid argument for or against polygamy?

Would you be interested in a new Subreddit dedicated to intriguing conversations?   Its called [Reddit Talk](http://www.reddit.com/r/RedditTalk/). Its a new Subreddit focusing on interesting conversations. 

I was inspired to create it after stumbling upon specific comment threads that were having interesting conversations, or ""talks"" about specific subjects.

This new community will make it easier for Redditors to have acces to and freely contribute to conversations that interest them. 

Reddit Talk does not limit thread topics but instead allows for anyone to create a new post with the intent of having a thought provoking conversation. 

So what do you think? Please suggest any ideas!   Where do you see Reddit in 10 years?   The internet moves at a lightning pace. In the span of 10 years we will most likely see a lot, popular websites may fall, new ones may rise. In your opinion what do you think the future holds for Reddit?   Reddit Talk: A Place to engage in any type of conversation     Discussion Threads  In almost every comment section I seem to come in contact with the conversation seems to be full of wit and intrigue. The sad fact is that those conversations are normally lost and receive little recognition. 

A remedy to this is a proposal for a new sub-reddit dedicated to conversations. This would be different to AskReddit in that the purpose of the thread would be to discuss varying topics. For example: How WWI directly led to WWII, NASA's future, The history of China, etc. 

I believe Reddit users are keen and would love to take part in highbrow discussions without the corruption of karma desperate posts. 

Here is the new subreddit: [r/RedditTalk](http://www.reddit.com/r/RedditTalk/)

Feel free to start a new conversation. 

EDIT: Does anyone know how I could spread the word on the new subreddit?  What would happen if the South were to ""rise"" again?

[An Update on Our [FIXED] Submission Removal Trial](http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/pnm1o/an_update_on_our_fixed_submission_removal_trial/)

The Moderators of [/r/Minecraft](/r/Minecraft) believe this is best for their community. The rule states that no [FIXED] posts or other submissions should reference another within 24 hours of the other being posted. 

What do you think about this? Should more subreddits do it? Should the members of the subreddit be allowed to vote on this change? 
  DAE think that a community run subreddit should be allowed to vote on rules governing the community?   This question is in regards to [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/pnm1o/an_update_on_our_fixed_submission_removal_trial/) new post reaffirming the rule that bans [FIXED] posts. 

How does [/r/Minecraft](/r/Minecraft) feel about requiring rule changes like this to be put to a vote!

That means 10,000 people went out of their way to show their distaste! 

2) [This post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/pk3qq/prepare_for_your_world_to_be_rocked/) manages to get 6,000 upvotes and 4,404 downvotes!

How is this possible? Why is the difference between the upvotes and downvotes so slim? Can so many people dislike popular things so much or is half of Reddit made up of spiteful 9gagers and 4chaners? 

There is no other voting system I know where this happens!  My campaign posters for the Junior class presidency     What local advertisement annoys you to no end?  For me its The Auto Connection's ads.

ESPN will show highlights but they are disjointed. Their site loads terribly and their video player seems to break every time I use it. So why go to a bad site to watch poorly produced highlight videos?   

There seems to be a huge gap in the market for highlights. The problem, of course, is that no startup would be able to pay the league licensing fees of the raw footage.      Once a profit powerhouse, ESPN has become a business in crisis as it struggles to navigate the eroding pay-TV industry. Some conservative critics attribute this to a newly politicized network. Other conservatives say they recognize that ESPNs business problems are deeper  and that the political aspect to ESPN is merely an attempt to generate heat amid that decline. The gleeful reaction, some say, is mostly just schadenfreude. Either way, in the parlance of trolls abusing sportswriters Twitter mentions, conservatives say ESPN should stick to sports.


The article essentially ascribes the decline of ESPN to a list of issues:

1)  Spending billions of dollars a year on expensive sports rights.

2) Falling subscriber rates as people ""cut the cord."" 

3) Young people (main demographic) get highlights from social media.

4) Stats and scores are easier to find online.

The sites seem overly vague and uncredentialed. They say that they are endorsed by ""rabbanim"" (its like a rabbi, more weighty (many feel that you NEED to follow directives from rabbanim)), but does not list them. And also by ""askanim"" (leaders of communal affairs), which are also not listed.

I am not libertarian, however, I do wish to understand other's viewpoints. I am not here to argue, but to listen.

I was wondering how Libertarians would address the international arms market? 

Ron Paul says that by not interfering with foreign wars, we will no longer be part of the problem. However, if we will be allowing free trade of weapons to whomever, this can exacerbate the problems, and moreover, they may still blame the US for their problems, because many people will see that the government does not care that their citizens are merchants of death around the world. 

Secondly, would there be restrictions on the types of weapons traded? Can, under Libertarian society, a person develop bio/chemical weapons and trade them freely? Or how about Nuclear?

To me it seems that market equilibrium in the weapons trade is everyone is dead.

Additionally, within in the US itself, would weapons be controlled? And by weapons I mean, tanks, mortars, missiles etc. and even more, WMDs?  Over the Edge.

In my research, it looks like the things he was most remembered for, policy wise all happened in his first term. China, gold standard, epa, Paris accords etc. 

Was he able to do anything in his second term? Did events unfold slowly enough for him to do anything initially. If he was able to govern, when did that stop?

So he confuses me     Interesting you mention Jew as a term. It is etymologically from the tribe of Judah. Which David was part of, and likely identified himself as. However, traditionally, when referencing Jews of that time, Israelites and Hebrews are more common. Israelites being descendents of Israel(Jacob), the last forefather that bound the 12/13 tribes. Hebrew, meaning from the other side (of the Jordan River) refers to their ethnic origin and language, but also includes ishamelites, moabites and ammonites, and a couple of other tribes     Would you say that your emphasis on libertarian economics (chicago, Austrian etc) and other ideas primarily stem from a practical or moral concern?

Seeing the quick development and prioritization of the semi, it almost certainly going to be a class 6 or 7 local hauler that will share much of the technology with the X. 

Given a gvw of a model X 100d pulling it's max (hitch), of 11,000#, and running at 168 Miles (per range factoring), I'd say we are looking at no more than 200kw battery pack. 

That could be a haul of 11,000# (gvw 16-17k#) for 150 Miles. 

This short haul could serve most deliveries, have more downtime to allow for standard charging. Also, by keeping the vehicle in the same weight range as the x, you can share a lot of the mechanical parts. 

Remember, every 400# or so of curb weight needs a redesign of the suspension, ball bearings, brakes, axles and drive trains, etc etc etc. 

It wouldn't make sense for Tesla to prioritize a completely new vehicle with new technologies (ie fast charging) before doing things that do share, like model Y.      Most people here are looking at long haul semis. While those are some of the biggest fuel hogs, and most benefit from self driving, I think the current logistics and policies are too large a hurdle in the near term for Tesla to have prioritized that. 

I think they're aiming at local deliveries and short haul semis (think distribution center to retailer). 

These require much less range, and more downtime to charge (ie while loading/unloading), and see most of the operating expense savings in the idling costs. 

Therefore, I'd say that we are looking at class 6/7 trucks, at most, not class 8 tractor trailers. These take into account load of the vehicle+payload. The class 7 being a gross weight of 11-15 or so tons.

A class 7 Mack can carry 8-11,000 pounds. 

Assuming a range of 150 miles (Greenfield distribution centers to City center retailer), And 30mph average (in City), I think there are more that electric could offer here with current technology and industry and regulations. 

The model X curb weight is 5,300lbs. And can tow 5,000lbs. The model X range while towing is 60% of its maximum of 280 (at 50mph avg) source: https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-model-x-range-impact-towing/amp ), which gives it a total 168mile range. 

This means, that with a 100kw motor, and a curb weight similar to X (all that suv weight converted into trailer weight), means that it could be a a class 3 without much Change in technology, or even production line tweaks. (bigger cars mean bigger everything, from axles and suspension to ball bearings and headlights), and keeping it in line with current makes it cheaper and faster to design and build. 

Therefore, I don't see larger than 200kw (to get a class 7 to 150 miles) battery in the immediate offering, perhaps later, though.      Oh, you mean like the founding fathers didn't intend separation of church and state? We need to incorporate religion in our government?

Only one of them produces this result.      2 more and you've got 7 sins     Red solos     It's a pyramid scheme     And Nunes and Issa      The GOP have a nearly 60 seat majority. Even if all 23 go Dem, and double that and another 23 flip, the GOP would still have a significant majority - and that's on top of the current incumbency when rate. 

In 2016,97% of incumbents won, with and average 35% margin. Previous elections have 85-90% incumbency won rates. 

Even if you double the average flip rate, and win 70% of open races (usually 40 seats),  it's still cutting it by close. 

It's a serious uphill battle that requires fundamental shifts in voting behavior.      You weighed less.      America has borderless entry and free movement from Alabama through to Vermont, and West Virginia to New Mexico.      The mummy marketing team knows their audience.

:/     I'm jewish, so, rabbi, merchant or money lender. Sounds about right.      Her father is Lebanese     How old were you?     It is, but they know you can ship a pebble, and then claim it was $1,000,000. Being that they would have no way of verifying this after the fact, they insure your stuff, up to a maximum of like 3.50. (above delivery charges, that they refund).

Any more money, you must declare in advance, and to prevent everyone from declaring everything at 1,000,000, they charge you for more. 

It makes sense to most people, if you're shipping cheap stuff, you don't have to buy insurance.     My city, too. Though it's a volunteer ambulance company (chicago), so it's like free advertising or something     Unfortunately, there is no way scotus won't wait until Gorsuch is confirmed.

Citizens United was literally (in the literal sense) about her. 

Citizens United was an anti-Hillary group. 


Of course she isn't pro citizens United.      And this in a year crazy for sports. From GSW vs Cav, the no-name win in the premiership, pats SB, and real vs San germain     Calling a bluff is standard negotiation tactics. 

No way a republican will vote against a bill touted as repealing Obamacare, even if it isn't.      From a negotiation standpoint, it's calling a bluff. 

He's gambling that the freedom caucus (primary holdouts) are just bluffing on the no, and that they would be vote for their anyways. 

Additionally, he's gambling that the freedom caucus would rather vote for a bill they don't agree with than vote against Obamacare repeal. A) they've promised repeal for so long, it's hard for them to imagine that they would vote no on the one Chance they got, and B) the freedom caucus is no longer the popular wing of the party - trumpism is. Trumpism is a cult of personality, not ideology, so he's gambling that he is more popular than the representatives in their districts, and they wouldn't be able to stave off primary if they vote no. 

  White House, in gamble, demands make-or-break health vote    Lincoln was a Republican, slavery is bad  and more discoveries by President Obvious       Then why would the article fucking link to the list?

This is exactly the media bring complicit and in collaboration with this fascist government.

If the list is a nazi tactic, then dissemination of the list is collaboration. Without the press showing you the list, then the list of meaningless. 

This is why the press is losing credibility.      Its a local business, large, but not nearly large enough to think that that would pass     My brother spent 100K building an alcohol collection over six months, along with 300k in other spending.  


While spectacularly stupid, not to mention criminal, I wonder why it took the company so long to find out. Don't they pay it each month?      This would be a good time to do something about the red menace of Vladimir Putins Russia. Instead, were talking about the Red Raiders of Texas Tech.

FBI Director James B. Comey, testifying Monday about his agencys investigation into Russias attempt to tilt the 2016 election to Donald Trump, explained why it was a fairly easy judgment that Trump was Putins favored candidate: Putin hated Secretary Clinton so much that the flip side of that coin was he had a clear preference for the person running against the person he hated so much.

But Rep. K. Michael Conaway (R-Tex.), a senior member of the House Intelligence Committee, was having none of it. Yeah, that logic might work on Saturday afternoon when my wifes Red Raiders are playing the Texas Longhorns. Conaway doubted such reasoning all the rest of the time.

So, Putin wanted Hillary Clinton to lose but didnt",0

Tips: 1. Get to know how behaves your coil. Set PWM from 0 to 255 with code, and see the graph. Mine looks like a _/- flat until 30 pwm, then polinomial 3rd degree until 220, then almost flat again. (I used matlab). Then work in the ""security zone""

Tip 2: Have a look at my filter. I found it googling, and it smooths the signal a lot     Here: https://codebender.cc/sketch:426102

It is a magnetic levitator. At about 20 secs you can see the graphic with the setpoint (steady line) and a moving graph (the real position  of the object, in this case the glass). That position is given by two ir sensors ( (analogread(A1)+ analogread(A2))/2. I would like to send that same graphic to an LCD or to a phone via bluethoot so anyone can see it. My setup makes about 800 calculations per second, but the graph does not need to be so accurate.      Maybe I didn't explain myself enough, sorry.

As you can see in the video, it uses an UV led strip. The water is not yet fluorescent, and the flickering you see is due to the frame rate of the phone, not the device itself. However, I think I could improve it with the timing with two changes:
1st. Calculate with more precision the drop rate with a laser pointer and a light sensitive resistor (I don't remember the exact name right now). Any other ideas.

I always wanted to play TF2 but never had a computer or console good enough to play it (I'm aware of how lame that is) but now my housemate has a PS3 so I got myself a copy of TF2 but now when i go on the servers to play there's no one there. Did I catch it at a bad time or does no one play it on there anymore? Has the boat just sailed or is there something I can do?

Please don't just put 'Get it on PC or Mac' I don't have a decent enough PC and can't afford to upgrade.

Not sure how to get it as a playable link. Every time I go on here and it pops up at the side I know an hour is going to disappear     Usual saturday night for Biggins isn't it?     I had to study this as part of my Degree and I'd never noticed before but this film actually centers a lot round Nazi Propaganda. The SS troopers, fighting a non human enemy, being a citizen not a civilian. Even the uniforms are similar to that of the SS. Don't get me wrong it's not pro-Nazi in the slightest, it was just an example of their use of propaganda and brain washing a populace to fight an enemy.

Also it fucking rocks, I love this film. ""Kill them....Kill them all!""  Went on the Pirelli site, ONCE SEEN.....       I once got a key in my eye at my saturday job and had to wear an eye patch for about 2 weeks. The doctor gave me a flouresent pink one and when I asked why he said 'it's skin coloured!' I told him I wasn't a Mr Man and my skin wasn't that colour so he asked what colour i wanted and I said black and he said he wasn't the owner of a fancy dress shop.....Touch Mr Doctor man!

I was still at school at the time which was the hardest when I had the eye patch but I also went on a date with it. It went a lot better than I expected but still never went on a second date     Loved the tabs at the tops. Narwhals, xkcd, bacon.com, sad keanu, and some por...

Gordon Ramsay Tasting Prank       It was lovely but if I'm honest I think I put too much oil in it and should've started the pasta sooner. Had to take the garlic off the heat and wait for the pasta to cook, which meant the garlic was a bit overcooked. I know I'm making it sound like I fucked up every aspect of it (and maybe I did) but it was still really tasty and I want to try it again but get the timings right.

It was just like the scene from chef except I don't remember Jon Favreau swearing at the pasta as he was frantically stripping the parsley from the stalks....     No thank you, I can't wait to make 'Sexy Jon Favreau Eyes' at my Mrs. :)

I have to ask, are you the head chef at a restaurant? I find your knowledge of food and cooking styles astounding. I love to cook but I have to follow a recipe or I'm completely lost.

My friend is the director Sam Ashurst, I met him through doing stand up comedy. Really funny guy and huge horror nerd, it makes me so happy he's finally making his first feature.

As for the film this is all I know... 

Following his excellent short film Hells Garden, which played at FrightFest last year and won Total Films Best Scare award, Ashurst has made the jump into features, and heres the plot synopsis

Arcadia State is the story of Sarah (April Pearson), a timid nurse bullied by her boyfriend Paul (Mike Beckingham) and her Arcadia State Hospital colleagues in equal measure. But when Sarahs tasked with caring for a new coma patient, Simon (James Swanton), she starts to experience weird visions and dark dreams, until her life changes forever

Arcadia State stars April Pearson (Skins, Tormented, Tank 432), James Swanton (Double Date) and Mike Beckingham (Subconscious). No release date has been announced yet.     That's awesome, thanks mate.   After winning Total Films Best Scare award, a buddy of mine has directed his first feature, a horror film called 'Arcadia State'.

US    Series 1 Episode 1 of British comedy 'Campus' is up on YouTube, starring Sara Pascoe and Andy Nyman.       17-15 to England but yeah      It pretty much goes like this ""Ooooh a person, nom nom nom.""     I love Derren Brown!     It's a comedy show. I think the point is just have fun with it and not a social experiment.

Stand up comedian tells funny story about a social worker and a dog       Cheers mate     I'm a comedian and I need to write my 3rd hour of comedy before August for the Edinburgh festival (I have 20 mins so far) which is stressful. I still have a day job where I manage 15 people but because of the comedy I can feel myself slipping and not doing as good a job as I used to. I worry I'll eventually lose the job and won't be able to pay my mortgage, which is stressful. I have to plan my wedding and find the money for it this year. Which is stressful. My Mum is an alcoholic and suffering from depression and it makes all my interactions with my family incredibly stressful. 

Other than that I'm pretty happy. The comedy and the fact I'm getting married make up for the stress.

And this is how you make a shit child.       I run that channel! Dead Parrot is my online baby and we're working with production companies to get fully licensed episodes of UK comedy shows on YouTube. We're trying to get a load more British shows on there but I was over the moon to get Catterick. We should be putting 'The Club' on the channel soon too.     I was at that show! I'd never rated them until that performance and it blew me away. They were amazing.  Think 3D Printing Human Tissue is cool? Wait until you find out where they get the human cells from...       I think it's more a regional thing, the US have access to everything first and the other regions play catch up. They've made a few original videos like the piracy one, the react parodies and also the UK [AS] bumps. I'm just grateful for the additional content. 

     I think the idea is this was made by someone who doesn't understand women... or dogs.      Well that was the whole point. The food is OK and affordable but there are quite a few similar restaurants on that street. This is the only one where they really take time to treat you like shit and it's brilliant.      I bloody love Wong Kei's. They would always force you to sit on a table with people who definitely don't want you there and regularly shout for your order and then sigh loudly when you said what you wanted. I still go there now but it's less rude these days.     This is just a rip off from the official channel with the end board cut off? The guy even burnt his own channel name into the top right corner?!

Yep  They say if you're good at something don't do it for free. So here is my second solo hour of stand up on YouTube...       I went to Finland once with work and it was insane, all the women were so incredibly hot and all the men were just getting smashed. They all sat in a circle passing round spirits and singing whilst the women all just stood at the bar waiting for someone to talk to them. I had some of the best sex I've ever had that weekend and all I had to do was be able to stand on my own two feet and not dribble when I talked and that made me attractive.

I didn't win but still had a great time. Let me know what you think.       That reminds me of a story I heard when I was viewing Universities. One of the students doing a tour of the campus told a story about people being really protective over their food stuffs in shared accommodation and one student thought his milk would be safe by leaving a note on it saying 'I've spat in this milk' and when he went back the next day there was another sign saying 'so have I.'

I never went to that Uni...     It makes me wonder how much advertising we subconsciously fall for every day without realising it.     This doesn't look to have to same humour as the original. It looks like it's going to straight up scares which isn't what the original was all about. Then again it was a film of its time.      I remember listening to his 'Funhouse' show on Spotify at work and literally crying with laughter the first time round. He's utterly hilarious.     Ever thought that he's actually a constant. He's actually the same guy in all of these things and ties their universes together... just a thought.     Well fuck me, that's one awesome commercial.      How had I forgot about Breakbot?!?!

So more karma for you     I really don't know how I feel about this, a load of prisoner doing the hustle. Are they forced to do this? Do they get their sentence reduced? How are they so awesome?

It added something else to the universe of the game that just made it stand out for me. Also I would watch Address Unknown if it was a real show.     I know I would freak out if that happened to me, very much like that guy did I suppose. As for Trick or Treat I think there are a few videos on YouTube, it was a pretty entertaining series.

EDIT: Here's a Trick or Treat video where he turns people into statues - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KNakFGU_b8 I can never tell if it's fake or not.     Usually not one for London gangland films, Danny Dyer and his ilk ruined it for best part of a decade but that actually looks really good. The lead looks like a believable hard bastard. Also like the way it's shot. Will have to check this out.     Ah cool, be good to meet a fellow redditor  What do you guys think of the Promo for my new Edinburgh Show?       A similar thing happened to a good friend of mine and he handled it like a [king](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4wY3ItGvyc)  What.the.fuck? A Family Guy Porno with Ron Jeremy...       Ok now that is a film I would pay to see. Even if Link does get his face re-arranged.     Wouldn't say they're 'crazy' facts but more interesting fact.     I feel so welcome on Zombocom  One of the funniest websites I've seen in ages       God damn that's hot! I need some time alone to think about what I just saw and how I feel about it...     I think it's the audio played through her phone or Derren says something. I think gassing her would've made this trick a bit *too* real.     I don't know much about Castlevania as a series but this looks pretty awesome.

I don't know Luke personally but my mate does, he's the one who passed this onto me. You can Columbo it all you like I've got nothing to hide. I don't believe it's viral but if it is I've been duped.   ""I've got a nice c*nt though ain't I?"" - World's classiest girl on the train...        My friend showed me and the first video I thought it was entertaining and might in some way work but then he sent me this one I just sat opened mouthed and though ""You've fucked it there mate....""     He's mates with a friend of mine, the story is mad. He drunkenly kissed a girl at a party and then told his girlfriend (i think the very next day) and she left him. He was mortified so he did [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3sZohPeu1M feature=relmfu) then followed it up with this latest video but still hasn't heard back from her.

I thought it was admirable at first but this latest video is just awful.  Guy cheats on Girlfriend and tries to win her back in the WORST way possible!       I want to cuddle the shit out of that little bundle of joy.     I'm sure there's a song about this     My Dad told me about when he bought this album from the record shop and it was a really cold and icy day and he took almost an hour to walk home as he only took tiny baby steps so he wouldn't risk falling over and breaking the record. 

It meant so much when he gave it the to me.  This is a pretty cool YouTube channel all about Wine    Not sure which subreddit this should go in but this tune is amazing - Juiceboxxx and Dre Skull - Center Stage (Curses!

Ah man the memories     Ah man I hope you're still going!!     Now with ultimate 'Night Sweats' mode and 'Divorce' setting for when your spouse just *""Doesn't know you any more!""* **WAR!!!!!**     Amazing video, although I do kinda feel like this music would make you feel guilty every time you shot someone...which is not why I play games.     You sir make a very good point     We're gonna need a bigger....moat?     To be fair I think the Portal gun wins out if you put it like that, I'd never seen anything like the Cerebal Bore and was blown away by it...then again I was like 13, so maybe you're right.     Yeah but to me the gravity gun, laptop gun and cerebal bore are imaginative, you really thought 'wow' when you first used it. The others are just powerful...although the Chainsaw will always be very cool.  What do you think is the most imaginative weapon in a game? My favourite will always be the Cerebal Bore from Turok 2.       In Britain the norm is your GF would give you a mean look and tear you a new one when you're home. I personally have never had to carry my gf away from another woman...then again I've never had a hot pottery teacher talk filthy to me, but I can dream.

Best weekend of my life!     [Well played](http://assets0.ordienetworks.com/images/GifGuide/clapping/taxidriver.gif)     Cheers man     I've been at it 2 years this month but that video was from 4 months ago, I've done Edinburgh festival since and feel a lot more confident. I'm back at the Comedy Store this month and really excited/nervous. Should be fun though.  I beat a night which encourages the audience to boo at The Comedy Store, London. It was a scary experience!       I'm a stand up Comic on the London Circuit and if anyone did that they'd get fucking crucified. I've witnessed it myself, one guy kept coming to clubs doing Bill Hick material thinking no-one would know. At comedy clubs you have comedians and comedy fans, watching comedy is what they love, so chances are someone in the crowd will know the material and chances are that person will be drunk or proud enough to call the thief out on it.

I'm pleased it was so shit, the guy is a thief with no real talent. It angered me what the final judge said. If your own material is shit, don't do comedy. Don't try to make a living or get praise for other peoples hard work.   It must be one fucking brave 15 year old boy to date Gordon Ramsay's daughter...       That would be awesome! haha     No problem :)     This was the first I'd heard it but I can imagine this is the kinda story that would do the rounds.  Harry Redknapp Tells Story About When He Brought A Mouthy Fan On To Play For West Ham.       Derrendevil  'A Real Life Batman' Derren Brown with a blind man uses sonar to detect what is around him.

If only they'd left it there!     I filmed this and if I'm honest that bit was funniest as the guys in Foxtons were just out of shot and they were just staring through the glass at us without a clue what was going on and by the time the management realised we were filming their logo we'd got the shot and were off. :)  If you hate people standing on the wrong side of the escalator, you might appreciate this video - Right Side Baby!

It only feels like an insult if you emphasise the 't' at the end, then it has an element of venom about it.     Yeah, never quite understood why Americans pronounce it 'twot' but apparently it's a serious insult over there. Twat's a pretty low level insult in the UK, my Mum used it on a regular basis.

     Haha, smart. Then you'd be able to take damn near anything you wanted, good answer      That was wheely good...      Carbon guys, settle down     Fork you man...

Neither, doesn't seem familiar     Call me your grace one more time and I'll have your head!      Aw, poor Shireen, I saw that combo and I remembered everything that went on between them. Sad :'(     Agreed, Tyrion and Bronn made a great duo, hilarious.      HOLY CRAP. that looks awesome.      Just cause something isn't really, doesn't mean it doesn't exist... 

Enough of that though, basically any living being would be classified as an animal in this case.      My exact thoughts     Yeah, but it's classified as an animal, a dragon egg all good, a dragon is a no no..      All I was saying was, that damn near everyone in game of thrones kills or has killed innocents. Name me a character and I'll prove it     What are your views of Gregor Clegane then? Better or worse then Tormund?      He killed a bunch of people sure, but just imagine how many more would have died without him.      I could name a dozen people who have done worse then tormund in game of thrones      She was probably apart of the faceless men, or some other assassin order.

Everybody Loves Dave  Dave was bragging to his boss one day, ""You know, I know everyone there is to know. Just name someone, anyone, and I know them.""
Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise?""
""No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it."" So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts,
""Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!""
Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.
""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Dave says.
""President Obama,"" his boss quickly retorts.
""Yup,"" Dave says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go.
At the White House, Obama spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.""
Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced. After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.
""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies.
""Sure!"" says Dave. ""I've known the Pope for years."" So off they fly to Rome.
Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope."" He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.
Sure enough, half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.
Making his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, ""What happened?""
His boss looks up and says, ""It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'Who the fuck is that on the balcony with Dave?'

Even though they went to war with the empire (recently) they still seem more inclined to speak Cyrodiilic. For example during the embassy mission in the first room you see two Altmer speaking in the common tongue, and in soltheim the Altmer who buy stalhrim speak exclusively in the common tongue regardless of your presence, plus, the note about capturing the blacksmith is written in the common tongue, why? Would it not be more secretive to write it in their own language? So, basically I'm wondering why do the Altmer we see seem to exclusively speak the common tongue?

Harry answered, ""I'm too smart for the 1st grade. My sister is in the 3rd grade and I'm smarter than she is! I think I should be in the 3rd grade too!""
Ms. Brooks had enough. She took Harry to the principal's office.
While Harry waited in the outer office, the teacher explained to the principal what the situation was. The principal told Ms. Brooks he would give the boy a test. If he failed to answer any of his questions he was to go back to the 1st grade and behave. She agreed.
Harry was brought in and the conditions were explained to him and he agreed to take the test.
Principal: ""What is 3 x 3?""
Harry: ""9.""
Principal: ""What is 6 x 6?""
Harry: ""36.""
And so it went with every question the principal thought a 3rd grader should know.
The principal looks at Ms. Brooks and tells her, ""I think Harry can go to the 3rdgrade.""
Ms. Brooks says to the principal, ""Let me ask him some questions.""
The principal and Harry both agreed.
Ms. Brooks asks, ""What does a cow have four of that I have only two of?""
Harry, after a moment: ""Legs.""
Ms Brooks: ""What is in your pants that you have but I do not have?""
The principal wondered why would she ask such a question!
Harry replied: ""Pockets.""
Ms. Brooks: ""What does a dog do that a man steps into?""
Harry: ""Pants.""
The principal sat forward with his mouth hanging open.
Ms. Brooks: ""What goes in hard and pink then comes out soft and sticky?""
The principal's eyes opened really wide and before he could stop the answer, Harry replied, ""Bubble gum.""
Ms. Brooks: ""What does a man do standing up, a woman does sitting down and a dog does on three legs?""
Harry: ""Shake hands.""
The principal was trembling.
Ms. Brooks: ""What word starts with an 'F' and ends in 'K' that means a lot of heat and excitement?""
Harry: ""Firetruck.""
The principal breathed a sigh of relief and told the teacher, ""Put Harry in the fifth-grade, I got the last six questions wrong... ""     I don't know, coffee with penis flavouring is pretty good...

That's pretty awesome, where'd you get it?      Aela, but then she mysteriously died in my house in solitude by taking several arrows to the chest. Then ended up being stuffed behind a cupboard in the upstairs bedroom. I didn't even see the murderer's face because I was in first person...      Why buy a cow? You've already got Lydia...     I disagree, oblivion still looks great. Sure it doesn't have the same graphics, but instead it has its own unique style of graphics, much more fantastical and more fantasy then Skyrim in my opinion.      Poor frost atronach, just wanted to join in on the party...      If we're thinking of the same one it'll be *Atherium Wars*     A good way to make heaps is by doing the dark brotherhood quest line, apart from that just gotta adventure and find stuff, high speech doesn't hurt though.      That last part is actually really smart, never thought of it before.      How do you make so little? The most I got was ~200k and would've been more if I didn't spend tons of it.      She would have made a great addition to the new pirates of the Caribbean movie...      By climbing them...      Just use mods, if you're going to exploit the game in such a away it makes no difference. However, if you're playing without mods then I suggest just going with the flow of the game. There's no need to have armour and weapons that are overkill, it breaks the experience of the game. 

However, if you wish to continue then I can confirm that that would be the proper steps to make it (however there is no potion to fortify alchemy, to rectify this you have to use potions that fortify enchanting then enchant stuff with fortify alchemy).      They do kind of suck in theory.     That was an offer that was mad by steam (I'm pretty sure)  when it came out, that if you have the base game plus all dlc you could get SE for free. I'm pretty certain they've discontinued that deal as of now.      If your asking ""will I be able to get the special edition free now?"" the answer is most likely no. If your asking ""should I buy special edition?"" the answer would be yes.      Because you're bad at it? Get a companion, get good robes max out the type of magic you want and put heaps of points in magicka.     You're telling me you finished the dark brotherhood, thrives guild, civil war, main quest and most daedric quests plus found moat locations in 37 hours? Have you used mods for shortcuts?     r/teslore is a good place to look, they'll also help with source for lore     Actually, a dragon born is blessed by Akatosh in a tine of need. He didn't want Alduin to win so he helped out.      Honestly, I've never actually joined the bards college, I always forget, anyways I'm pretty sire they have a shit story.      I'm skeptical, I don't think you were able to do all that in only 37 hours, radically the part about finding all locations.      I think you just walked into something...     Same, I'd become a rich philosopher and live out my life in a nice quaint city.      There's is no ""smart"" only less ignorant, and even then only by a small margin. We as humans know virtually nothing in contrast to the wealth of knowledge contained within the universe.      Super dense carbon atoms...      42?     Drinking and lust. No man can match me in these things. I am the god of tits and wine... I shall build a shrine to myself at the next brothel I visit.     I thinks it's more personal morals then the law that prevents this. At least in my own opinion.      Australia - down under - men at work     Not necessarily, they have a life span, therefore they must 'live'.     The sun wouldn't have to fight, it could just wait them out...

I've actually thought this before and a friend told me that it was one of Einstein's theories, small world.      The ability to stop and start time at a whim.       Yeah... Sure...      I agree that it's possible. A good example of misleading events is Jojen's greendreams which come true in unexpected ways.      Like blackfish and his personal sigil     ""you know nothing, Jon Snow""     Me, obviously...      That's actually one of the better spin-off ideas I've heard     Tyrion lannister, obviously     TheMountain or TheHound or even KingInTheNorth,  my personal suggestions at least.      Obviously...     That's some top quality twirling I must say...     The likeness is uncanny, well done. He's also my favourite character, he just can't help being so awesome     The chimer were those that left the Altmer to follow Veloth. Seeing as they travelled all over it is most likely that it would affect their physical appearance. In saying so I believe the chimer had darker skin then the Altmer. Apart from this I think they're quite similar, if not identical.     Looks pretty good, well done     After the death of their first child Cersei rarely had sex with Robert, if ever.   Divath Fyr (Morrowind) vs Neloth (dragonborn DLC)  An even playing field, they can bring whatever equipment they wish (in the field of reason), however staffs aren't permitted. An open field battle, strictly magic (however, the type is their choice).

Make it fair, so if one gets an item give a reasonable substitute to the other as well. That's really the only rule for equipment, so go nuts.   Kronos (Greek mythology) vs Vivec (Elder Scrolls)  Empty field, one on one, they can use anything they wish (armour, weapons magic).      What style did you use? It's quite pixie looking, not bad though     If Tyrion died, I'd probably still watch it but I'd have to grimace at every episode without him. He really livens the show up.      Looks great     BURN THEM! BURN THEM ALL!      I love how it says family, duty, honour. Well done     Sounds awesome, I would personally love to, unfortunately I don't have the time. But I've played several story's with a group of friends (usually not all that serious, to the DMs sadness), if you won't any help with anything I have a decent amount of experience, just PM me anything you need help with. Great idea though, GoT D D would be awesome, hope it works out.      Doubtless they did...      Oh, obviously, I thought it went without saying...      Tyrion, by far my favourite, he's funny, and quite witty. He's also a pretty good guy     Well... He's insanely bad at politics      This got real dark real quick     Agree to a truce, I really can't be bothered either     *wink wink*     Your entire argument is an error, every word you type is an error. In answer to the second 'example', maybe you should learn english, this is quite easy to decipher.

Just seems odd that he would use it in stead of oathkeeper      ""in [his] own bed, with a belly full of wine and a maiden's mouth around [his] cock, at the age of eighty,""     Out. Out now!...      Agreed.      I agree, after he burned Shireen, I was happy he *died*, he did show remorse especially after his wife **killed** herself. But that really took away all my sympathy for him      Yes... The man who went to the queen and divulged that he knew she was screwing Jaime and her kids were born of incest... Dude was as sane as they get...

It occurred to me that it's quite possible. Azor Ahai took a lot of time to forge the final iteration of the legendary sword, plunging it into his wife's heart. Both Valyrian steel and lightbringer were forged with magic and blood, is this a coincidence or because they are both the same? What I'm wondering is, is lightbringer Valyrian steel? Is this confirmed?      Is light bringer made of valyrian steel? I always wondered, I read some stuff and it seems possible, just like lightbringer valyrian swords require blood and magic to be forged, is this confirmed?      Yeah I know, but for the first two seasons he's only just coming into his story, it's mostly just him despairing about his legs.      Painting?      :'( I will buddy, I will...

Had to loosen my pants to ease the pressure, was determined to make it home. Was slapping my self in the face trying to zen monk control my body into not realising the garbage inside me.

Finally made it home after speeding when I could. Pulled into my driveway, jumped out pants still undone, they fell down, had to bend over to pick them up which begun my arsehole telling me enough was enough!

First of all my head became really heavy and the lead molten feeling melted down my neck and shoulders and into my torso. I felt like I was made of lead and concrete and my whole body was shaking. 

I realised I was laughing in hysterics, hence the shaking, but my body was so heavy I tried walking and looked at my feet, I was barefoot, they were on the polished concrete floor and I felt like I was absorbing the weight of my surroundings. I was becoming the concert box I was in.

I needed to get outside, slowly whilst in u controllable hysterics I made my way out side onto the brick patio, the roof was slightly higher out here and the air cooler and instantly I felt normal weight again, only this time I felt about eight foot tall. The small conifers in the patio garden all bowed down and shook there branches at me. I felt like thy were laughing too but later realised it must have been the echo from my own madman hysterics. 

Kept walking and ended up on the grass, I could feel the breeze on my face lifting me up higher and higher, looking up at the stars and I remember thinking how gravity's main drive is to keep you down and to root you to the earth, and how taller people have a greater power over gravity and me already being 6ft 5 had a greater power than most. I stretched really hard and became weightless, my hands stretched upwards to the sky, I could become the stars and concur gravity! 

I yelled out 'power' as loud as I could. That's where the trip ended. Arms up looking at the universe. I remember hearing my neighbours who were sitting in their yard next door asking each other what the fuck is he on? They would have heard pure hysterical magical laughter then me shout out as loud as I could, 'POWER!!!!'

subject1497,"    Cooler and denser air into the intake is always better for efficiency.     No.     What's 'fascist' about it? Why can't people understand the meaning of that word? It's not hard.     My mate showed me some Chinese two dollar coin forgeries the other day. There is literally nothing they will not (poorly) copy at someone else's expense.     Another islamic triumph!!     No. The juices 'escaping' is not a concern with any meat. Like people carrying on about 'sealing' a steak to 'retain' the juices. It's nonsense. You cannot seal a piece of meat.     Yeah but it gives me gas.     Only in Britain. No one else would call a paki an Asian.     You mean in muslim dominated areas anywhere in the World?     Twice, you mean. I see no problem going for a third time.     I think it needs to be leveled for a third time...     But muslims are so progressive! We need more of them in Western society, for some abstract reason. Surely, this type of behaviour can't firmly be rooted in their fundamental teachings...     Lame.     Don't pretend you don't know what I'm talking about. I'm onto you...     Ever had an abscess? When you do, you will learn.      Where are you talking about, FFS?     Shame they are so often confused with fucking muslims. Sikhs are alright.     Just educated yourself on muslims at the same time...     I'd kill to get me some grits, here in Oz. They were fucking great when I was in the States. 

I like the Kool-Aid, too. But when I first tried it, I didn't realise you had to put your own sugar in. I wondered why it tasted like arse. Yeah, some of that blue shit or tropical shit would be good.     We're talking about Chechnya, for fuck's sake. What part of that do you not understand?     Interesting. I think I understand.     Erm, yes, they do have conventional warheads on some of them. I'm asking how many they keep ready compared to nuclear.     Yeah, I got it going straight away. Didn't think it would be so easy.     Let's all race to conclusions before we find out WTF actually happened.     Yawn.     Fucker's got the biggest crop of ganja since Robert Trimbole. I fucking know it.     Say anything 'bad' and you're instantly banned, anyway. We can't have people saying what they think, after all...     Can you explain that a bit more?     I personally think the immigration issue could be (should be) ever so simple - persons coming from countries most like our own get ALL the places. ALL the priorities. That would instantly preclude fucking arabs, muslims, Sudanese, Lebs, Nigerians, etc.

Let the places allocated be filled by *worthy* people. People like us. White people. There are untold numbers of those kinds of people who should be here but instead of the others, but no, we pander to the fucking bleeding hearts club. Why? It makes no social or economic sense.

We need immigration. To a certain extent. That's just a fact. What we don't need is pieces of shit coming here and turning OUR place into what they just left behind. Fuck. That.     They'll never say hello to you - ever again.     Yeah but I still like doing it.     As long as they insist on artificial sweetening, they're shit.     Agreed. Have you seen the latest shitfight over in /r/Australia? A store owner had the hide to put up a sign outside his shop that forbade niggers of a certain type/age from entering, on account of repeated and rampant theft. There's even a video to go with it (showing said negroes) and half the people in the thread are all indignant that he should dare stand up for himself. What a fucking joke this country is.     I am also fucking hopeless at games. And when I set the fucking thing to easy, I really mean I want it easy. Like a walk in the park. A piece of cake. I play games mainly to just see what happens and to look at the cool graphics. Easy should mean EASY.     I wish we could have packets like that (no warnings and shit) in Australia. I can't even remember the last time I saw such a pack that wasn't part of my collection. Shame.     Rustic?     So is that stem hollow or solid?     If I were anywhere nearby, I would go out of my way to give him some extra business. He did nothing wrong.     Going cunt-up wasn't really a possibility.     Yep. It's garbage. What is it with this minimalist crap? The World isn't a fucking IKEA store.     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeF2QiwyDGM     Even though it shouldn't make headlines. If whites are the ones doing the wrong thing, fucking say so.     Yep. I hate shoplifters.     But we have to destroy a lot of things. Fast.     How many conventionally armed ICBMS do the US (and others) keep at the ready? I always wondered that.     Well, bugger me. I was always told Win 8.1 wouldn't do it. Well, that certainly makes it a lot easier. Thanks again.     Can you stop being a faggot and just fuck off? All you wanted was to start shit by being an unhelpful smartarse. And you got it. No one here cares what you think, do or say. Especially me. Why don't you find someone else to annoy with your lmgtfy crap? I got some actual answers from some non retarded people. Why are you even here? You clearly don't want to help, so kindly fuck off.  Free software for mounting .iso files in Win 8.1? Looking for some recommendations  I was using Demon Tools but some people say it's spyware/malware. Does anyone have a favourite program they could recommend?  Is it true that you can only get packs of 20 in the US?  Dunno where I heard it but someone told me that. Any truth to that? We have packets containing many different numbers, here in Oz. 20, 25, 30, 40, 50 and other weird numbers to keep the cost of a pack at the same price.  Got my Witcher 3 .iso. What mounting software would you recommend?  Like I said, I've downloaded it as an .iso but Win 8.1 does not support mounting .iso files, natively (or so I'm told). Anyone know of some reputable mounting software that isn't adware/spyware/malware?

And where do I put my save game files? I was halfway through playing it on an other PC that dies. I managed to get the save files but no idea where to put them, now. Does anyone know?

  Why are there folders called ""program files"" and ""program files(x86)""on Windows computers?  Why does there have to be two of them? Isn't one enough? It seems to make absolutely no difference which one you save things to. Or am I missing something?  Why doesn't the search function work? I have just tried it 100 times in a row and it has failed every single time  This is ridiculous. It's a fucking joke.  Which add-on for FireFox would you recommend to stop sites autoplaying videos (except youtube)?  I am fucking sick of this shit. I'm sick of fucking (especially) news sites and others autoplaying things at high volume. I've used NoScript before but that ends up being more trouble than it's worth, as it disables everything.

Any suggestions?  Here is a rubber duck floating on a fluidised bed    Here is a rubber duck floating on a fluidised bed    [Ubuntu 16.04] Having a problem entering the password I created to turn off UEFI secure boot  I'm very new to this and I have a strange problem. First, I was unable to use the apt command, due to a lock file being in place. I followed some instructions I found and after I fixed the problem, a blue screen came up that said I needed to disable secure boot. It said I had to create a password and next time the computer started up I would be asked for it.

So I make a password, restart it and the blue screen asking for my password appears. But I can't enter the password. 

It says please enter character 8, or character 4 or some other number. But when I type the password, nothing happens. Hitting enter makes it say enter another numbered character.

WTF is going on? I don't know how to enter this password. If I just keep hitting enter, it eventually says invalid character and gives me the option to continue booting or try again.

Does anyone know WTF is going on? I'm using an ASUS F555U laptop if that helps.  Mounting an .iso file?  I've got the game I want but I'm not sure what to do with it. I assume I just right click -- mount? (Win 8.1). But where exactly should I put the .iso before I do that? Does it really matter? The game is Witcher 3.

Never done this before. Should I be using special mounting software or something?  I swear I have seen throttle bodies in a couple of diesel engines. How can that be?  Where I used to work we would do minor things like top up fluids and shit. I swear that on a couple of the diesel utes there was a throttle body (or what looked exactly like one). I didn't have long enough to pull it apart and inspect it though. WTF is going on? Since when does a diesel need a throttle plate?  I built a gaming PC last year. Can someone tell me how good or bad it is? I don't really know what I'm doing. I just spent what I could afford at the time  I'm perfectly happy to hear all opinions. I just want to know where it stands in the scheme of things and more importantly, what I can do to wring the most out of it.

OK, so have the following components:

GigaByte Z170-HD3 mobo

Core i5 6600K processor

8 GB DDR4 Hyper-X Fury RAM

GeForce 960 4GB graphics card

1 TB HDD (not solid state)

40'' 1080p screen (using HDMI input)

I put it together and it all seems to work fine with Windows 8.1. I like playing Oblivion/Skyrim, Fallout 3/4/NV, Witcher 3 and the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games.

I can set them all to maximum settings without any crashes but I wonder if I'm truly experiencing them totally maxed out. I really don't know what the frame rates are - people seem to talk about that like it's the most important thing. Is that the case?

I know my HDD is a piece of shit and I'd dearly love a solid state one but I won't buy it until I can get a reasonably good one. Obviously, more RAM wouldn't hurt.

So, am I really getting the best out of these games and what changes within the nVidia graphics card settings should I be looking at? I haven't touched any of that stuff. Dunno what half of it means.

Opinions? Other subreddits to ask my questions?  Can't find my saves. I know where it's supposed to be but I simply can't get there  My PC died and I had to reinstall Windows (8.1). I reinstalled SDV and created a save. Now I cannot locate it. I know it's supposed to be in appdata\roaming but I cannot find that directory. What do I do?  Please help my tiny little brain to understand why statistical power increases the ability to reduce Type II errors  I keep arriving at Type I when I look at the table. I know what the answer is (increased power reduces the chance of a Type II error) but I just can't get it through my fucking head as to why that is.  Does anyone know the hardware requirements for Mandelbulber?  I just installed it on Ubuntu but I can't seem to find any references to how powerful your system needs to be. Does anyone know?  What's going on with VLC? I've had a number of problems with the latest version and on different devices.  First of all, it was causing Ubuntu to freeze if the mouse was not moved enough. Now I'm having it 'freeze' (but keep playing - the picture and sound stop but the counter continues) on both Windows and Linux - with the same files.

WTF is going on? VLC used to be rock solid.  Would someone mind having a quick look at my terminal output with regard to not being able to use the apt command?  I'm havin a major problem in Ubuntu 16.04. Here is what's happening:

When I use sudo apt-get or sudo apt it says there is a lock file. I don't understand why. For example, this is what ""sudo apt-get update"" returns:

    E: Could not get lock /var/lib/apt/lists/lock - open (11: Resource 
    temporarily unavailable)

    E: Unable to lock directory /var/lib/apt/lists/

    E: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11: Resource temporarily 
    unavailable)

    E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another 
    process using it?

Nothing has so far worked. Another user, /u/_-Justin-_ has suggested a few ideas, the first being to try this command:

    sudo lsof /var/lib/dpkg/lock

So I ran that command and got the following output:

    lsof: WARNING: can't stat() fuse.gvfsd-fuse file system /run/user
    /1000/gvfs

    Output information may be incomplete.

    COMMAND  PID USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF    NODE NAME
    dpkg    2308 root    3uW  REG    8,6        0 6829072 /var/lib/dpkg/lock

I'm not sure what to make of this. He also gave some other commands but I don't know if I should run them or not. The original post is here, with the additional commands he suggests:

https://www.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs/comments/63d5mt/cannot_use_the_updateupgrade_commands_lock_file/

Does anyone know what's going on? I can't update my system at all (with my limited knowledge) and it's getting to the point where I am considering re-installing because I can't work out what to do. I want to use Linux and learn about it but I simply can't do it like this.

Is there a better place to ask about this? I don't want to annoy people but I really need this sorted.  [Win 8.1] Is there a way to force windows/programs/whatever to always open on the screen you are currently using?  I'm using two screens. One big one for games and stuff and another small one for things like reddit.

If I click on (say) file explorer, I want it to open on the screen I clicked on, not the other monitor. Why it doesn't is a mystery to me. I'm constantly having to get up, got to the other monitor and drag shit back to where I want it. 

Is there any way to stop this behavior? I always, always want the window to open on the monitor I'm using, no matter what it is.  Can't get administrator privileges in on my new Win 8.1 install.  This is fucking ridiculous. I have never had this crap before. I just did a fresh install and I don't have administrator privileges, even though my one and only account clearly says 'administrator' next to it. I can't even save a file in program files. 

How can I change this? Nothing I've found online will work. I had full privileges before I did a reinstall and I certainly didn't have to beg for them. They were there from the start.

I need admin privileges, full stop. The system is useless to me without them.

How do I either force them on the account I have or make a new account instead?  I'm noticing that an increasing number of sites are able to 'ignore' the blocks I put on elements with uBlock plus. How can this be fixed?  I'm using the 'block element' tool. It used to be extremely effective but it's failing pretty badly of late. And it's pissing me off. I'm using FireFox.

For example, I block autoplaying videos on some site and when I reload, they are back. I disable scrolling banners and they reappear, next time I'm on that site.

How are they doing this and how can I beat them? If I don't want to see it, I don't want to fucking see it.

And are there any other appropriate subreddits to ask in?  Cannot use the update/upgrade commands. Lock file stopping it. I have been trying for a week, now  I have posted about this before and the issue is still not resolved. I simply cannot use sudo apt-get update or sudo apt full-upgrade. I continually get the message:

    E: Could not get lock /var/lib/apt/lists/lock - open (11: Resource 
    temporarily unavailable)

    E: Unable to lock directory /var/lib/apt/lists/

    E: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11: Resource temporarily 
    unavailable)

    E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another 
    process using it?

I have tried various methods with regard to removing the lock file (I don't understand WTF I'm doing, anyway) and nothing will work. This is getting extremely annoying. 

Ubuntu 16.04
    
      Trying to follow some instructions I found with regard to a 'lock' file. Would like to ask some questions before proceeding  When I try and do sudo apt full-upgrade I get an error:

    E: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11: Resource temporarily   
    unavailable)

    E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another 
    process using it?

So there is some problem with a lock file. I dunno what that even is. But I can work it out later. So, I found a page where this guy has the exact same error. I want to follow what he did but I have a few questions.

Firstly, why does his terminal user name start with:

    root@kali:~#

What is the ~# stuff? Mine starts with ~$. Why is that and does it make any difference?

Secondly, he says he enters the command:

    rm /var/lib/dpkg/

And gets an output of listed files. When I do that, it just says:

    '/var/lib/dpkg/': Is a directory

No lists and nothing happens. I thought rm means remove?

When I copy his next instruction:

    rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock

It does indeed ask me if I want to remove it:

    rm: remove write-protected regular empty file '/var/lib/dpkg/lock'?

So should I go through with this? Not knowing what that file is is worrying me. I'm terrified of fucking things up. I can't afford that right now.

So, what is this file, why is it in use, why is it write protected and am I safe to remove it? 
  If I use the ""assistive technologies"" route to upgrade Windows 8.1 to 10, will it ask for a product key? Because I have no idea what or where that key is  I got my computer as is, with 8.1 on it. No idea if it is legitimate, or otherwise (although I have not seen any warnings or anything like that). I have no idea how to tell.

I want to upgrade, using the assistive technologies loophole. But if I try that am I gonna get halfway through and then be asked for a key or something? I have no idea what the key is, I'm not the one who built the PC and installed the OS. 
  Looking to permanently delete some files from a portable hard drive. What programs are good for beginners?  Got some files I saved on a 500 GB external HDD that I want gone. But not all of them gone. Only some. And I do mean *permanently* deleted/overwritten/whatever. Someone else will be using this after me. 

Is there an easy to use program for beginners? Like some kind of file shredder that does not need extensive use of the terminal (I'm still learning terminal commands)?

  Pretty sure my Windows 8.1 PC is running pirated Windows OS. I bought it as is. Will it let me upgrade to Win 10?  Log time since I installed any Windows OS. The PC runs fine and I've never seen a warning about non genuine software. Will it upgrade to Win 10 without problems, even if the OS is non genuine?  Got a new external HDD. Should I format it before using it?  I can plug it in and use it straight away, of course. But is there any benefit in formatting it first?   Will the built in VPN just work straight after you install the browser?  I'm told Opera has a built in VPN. That would be handy for getting around restrictions on my uni site. Will it just work automatically after I install the browser? If not, is the set up particularly hard?  Anyone from Australia? What do you think about Port Royal tobacco? I've only tried the Rum   Wine flavour. Anyone tried Kentucky Bourbon?  Don't see it that often. I've thought about trying it but I always forget. What's it like compared to rum and wine?  Pirate Bay blocked in my country. How do I change DNS settings in Ubuntu?  [removed]  Pirate Bay blocked in my country. How do I change DNS settings in Ubuntu?  Preferably with the gui. I'm not very good at the terminal, yet. I looked in the IPV4 settings and the method is ""Automatic (DHCP)"". All the other boxes are blank. I'm a bit nervous about changing anything without help. I know I need to change something to ''8.8.8.8'' but I'm not sure what. I'm in Australia.  Why is my signal strength so poor with Ubuntu?  Same laptop (ASUS F555U) gets great signal with Windows and fucking shitty, intermittent signal strength with Ubuntu. That goes for my wireless router at home and my university public wi-fi. What's going on?  My 8.1 system has crashed. Unrecoverable. So what should I do? Should I buy 10? I want to use it for gaming, sometimes, but mostly watching videos and web surfing.  I'm sick of fighting with this shit. I've held out for as long as I can. I like using Linux for web browsing and so forth but I want to play games, as well. Windows 8.1 has died on me for the last time. How much does it cost for Win 10 outright? Can I purchase it and use it for both my desktop and laptop?

I like to play games sometimes but that is not the main concern. I really want a system where I can reliably dual boot it. I have a (main) system with the following specs:

Core i5 6600K, 16 GB DDR4 HyperX RAM, GeForce 1060 card, GigaByte 1070 mobo

What is the best option for me? Can I buy 10 and use it on both systems with the same account or something?  How do weather reports work? What does it mean when I see ""80% chance of rain""? 80% overall? 100% in 80% of the area in question? What?

So I just held down the power button until it shut down.

When I start it back up it says it is 'attempting repairs'. The repairs don't work and it gives me the options to refresh/restore/etc. I don't have an install disk and I don't want to completely refresh because all my shit will be lost.

So I choose the option to restore from some recent point (only one to choose from). It completes that operation and restarts, only to start up the same repair bullshit. Just an endless loop.

I really need some help right now.  The older I get, the more nervous I am about asking how my (similar aged) friends' parents are, as they might be dead    Can someone help me out on a very simple question on validity/reliability?  Q) Identify whether the error will affect the validity and/or the reliability of the measure:

""Participants are weighed wearing whatever clothes they happen to be wearing when they walk into the laboratory""

That's all it says. My thoughts are that the measure is neither valid nor reliable. Assuming they want the correct body weight, the clothes give an error that is not repeated (it's different for each person), so the measure cannot be reliable and since you are not measuring the true body weight, it's not valid, either.

Is that correct in any way?  Does anyone know what is going on with this missile guidance system?    Got a new laptop. Plugged in headphones and they don't seem to work - the sound just comes out of the speakers like normal. Am I doing something wrong?

This is ridiculous. I do not want to use Windows 10. I want to install Win7. I don't know what to do. I used Rufus to create a bootable USB drive and it just won't work.

The laptop specs are: Asus F555UJ-XO044T Laptop Intel i5 6200U 15.6"" 1TB 8GB RAM 2GB GT920 DVD Win10  What program would you recommend to make a bootable DVD?  I thought Rufus would do it but it doesn't seem to be able to do a DVD. I'm using Win 8.1 and I want to make a bootable DVD. What trustworthy programs are available? AnyBurn says it will make an .iso but will it be bootable?  Having trouble getting a Windows 10 laptop to boot an .iso file  I just got a refurbished Asus laptop with Win 10 installed. I want to install Windows 7 from a bootable USB drive. So I created a bootable USB drive with Rufus.

But when I change the boot order, it simply ignores those changes and goes straight back to Win10. If I disable the Windows10 boot option altogether, it simply goes back to BIOS when I restart it.

Fuck this shit. I want Win10 gone. Now. What is going on here? It was hard enough to find the BIOS settings and now this. What do I have to do to get this working?   TIL acetylene gas is dissolved in liquid acetone or DMF. This makes it much safer to transport and use, as it can violently polymerise at elevated pressures    Where can I get info on Lumin (mianserin) and its safety with other drugs?  Mianserin is an old tetracyclic antidepressant I take at high doses (140 mg/day) in conjunction with lithium. How dangerous are things like amphetamines and opioids for me?

I (luckily) found out not long ago that lithium and LSD do not go well together, so I won't be taking that any time soon.

But what about these weird old tetracyclics?  ELI5: What is a 'port' (with regard to file sharing) and why are there seemingly tens of thousands to choose from?  [removed]  Does anyone know the name of the arcade system that came out in the 90s and was a linked, multiplayer Mechwarrior type simulation?  You sat in a full cockpit that closed around you. You could choose from quite a number of mechs and then battle the other players in a linked game mode. There was no single player. At the end, you got a printout of how the battle progressed - you shot player A in the left leg, he hit you in the torso and so on.

It was fucking awesome. I played it in about 1995/6 in Sydney. Been dreaming of playing it again, ever since. It was very, very advanced for it's time.

Anyone know what is was?  When and where was the standard bottle cap decided upon?  I mean the caps you use a bottle opener on, not the twist top variety. Wherever you are in the World (I think) the bottle caps will all be standard with a standard size opening tool. Be t a bottle of beer, Coke or anything else, it's standard.

When and where was that size first marketed and who standardised it?   The Bacon Tree  Two Mexicans are stuck in the desert after crossing into the United States , wandering aimlessly and starving. They are about to just lie down and wait for death, when all of a sudden Luis says.........

""Hey Pepe, do you smell what I smell. Ees bacon, I theenk.""

""Si, Luis, eet sure smells like bacon. ""

With renewed hope they struggle up the next sand dune,   there, in the distance, is a tree loaded with bacon.

There's raw bacon, there's fried bacon, back bacon, double smoked bacon ... Every imaginable kind of cured pork.

""Pepe, Pepe, we ees saved. Ees a bacon tree.""

""Luis, maybe ees a meerage? We ees in the desert don't forget.""

""Pepe, since when deed you ever hear of a meerage that smell like bacon...ees no meerage, ees a bacon tree.""

And with that, Luis staggers towards the tree. He gets to within 5 metres, Pepe crawling close behind, when suddenly a machine gun opens up, and Luis drops like a wet sock. Mortally wounded, he warns Pepe with his dying breath,

""Pepe... Go back man, you was right, ees not a bacon tree!""

""Luis, Luis MI amigo... What ees it? ""

""Pepe.. Ees not a bacon tree. Ees

Ees

Ees

Ees

Ees a ham bush....""
  Why is it dimethylethylamine and not ethyldimethylamine?  I thought -eth would come before -meth. But that doesn't seem to be the case. Why not?     Interesting. Thanks.     Jesus christ.      What are those viewing ports(?) for?     Add forced induction and you're ",0
subject1499,"    Here for the laughs, little programming experience. What is recursion?     So I'm here for the laughs and prod is being mentioned quite often, what is it?     Hasbrown what?     I thought this was /r/programmerhumor  light hearted and fun.     Ah so her lawyers failed.     Not meaning that dollars are meant as the only source of wealth. For me wealth comes from a variety of sources.     That is something I forgot about.  But could that be written off in their taxes? Provided they kept receipts (I don't know if you need to keep them but I keep them for a while in case of an audit)     Alright will check it out.      So if one earns 60k a year and has 5 kids what is their tax?     Oh so in the end she was executed not for high treason but simply  onconspired to murder? A charge that would apply to all?     Start with playing support, at worst your adc will hate you, and it's one of the more forgiving roles of the game, try not to die, ward, try not to die while warding, protect your adc, maybe roam mid if you have the champ t do it and bot is in good shape.     Wow arguing on a technicality is when you know you are screwed     Very prudent and pointed reply, the hell no response brought a smile to my lips     What's ironic about it?     It's still wealth, I am not going to mind being paid in dollars even if there is no backing behind it. (Other then the US government guaranteeing it will accept it for taxes.)     Sure if they can navigate the tax code or somehow pay someone to navigate it for them, but if they are poor chances are they don't have the time to navigate it themselves, nor the money to pay others to do so. 

So theoretically they pay nothing but in reality they pay sticker price.     Previous draw netted me 2 BSB and 2 supers, BSB for cloud and serioth (super-long katana dude) so I was happy.     It's buggy but good enough quality to save this thanks     Got so at the command level was where it was decided.     Don't know how to post a picture but if some one would show me I can.     I would kill to get rid of the ton of medica I have, I have 4 healer burst soul breaks that I know of: Aerith, Garnet, Lenna, (the one smitten with Ziddane) Ekko and only God knows how many other medica that are only super or unique.     4/11 4 super soul breaks
None I could care about (still super so I would say worth) I guess Irvine: Hyper Sniper was the best of them.     Dam dingos, heard they can be brutal.     Were they happy to help? Or more like sorry it's my job? I heard part of the reason for gas chambers and such were the people who staffed the killing squads that would take people into rural areas and kill them, suffered from alcoholism and depression.     Dam 1.65% that's really high     It's sad that communism the ideal was drastically different from communism the practice (it was just a dictatorship) people saw the ideal but were herded into a dictatorship.     Bad as in body count?      A lot had been said rather vaguely could you post some sources or at least a wiki link to specific things you are talking about? Much appreciated.     With things such as Mcarthy and the scare, I think the USSR,s name was used as a tool to manipulate people.     Lenin opposed Stalin, but on the note of murderous revolutionaries, I think those that are labeled as revolutions tend to be bloody, of course there are exceptions. Lenin had a different course than the one Stalin had, so at the least it would have turned out differently.

Edit: minor grammar correction     Wow     Valentine's Day was around before Al Capone, but I assume this is a joke.     Read that as Rammus     I think it's a fake, it broke after the third swing.     I remember equipping it on a lv 6 with a lv 89 doing all the work, I look away and apparently my lv 6 got confused and hit my lv 89... on the plus side during battle of the big bridge even the weapon was really really useful     Thanks     Ward first before doing the strat, also the TP disadvantage isn't that big unless you are trying something risky but why do risky things when ahead? (It's like chess you use one small advantage to keep your self ahead without doing any risky things, you only try risky things when behind)     That sounds like https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryAnecdotes/
And beware often Ancedotes are trumped up.     But it costs gold and you need to buy it from a shop... which can be far depending where you are (mid lane, south jung, and north Jung)     So you don't really get hurt by the strat, as any CS you miss is made up by the jungle monster xp. It's actually a good thing to do bc you get a buff and you hurt the enemy jungler     They will learn our peaceful ways, *by force*

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ig2qZEiNv8     It's a thing for whatever odd reason.     Hey we now have satellites, GPS, better solar panels, material engineering, programming, and so much more, all these ""little"" things that were needed to get you out in space and thus were developed.     For awhile the ancient civilization of Hittites were thought to be mere fantasies but then evidence was uncovered, and then more, and now it's for sure a civilization      I did not know this it's pretty wow, I knew the link with lead, intelligence, and violence but it never hit me to think about leaded gas.     Was the soft cap always so low... crap all this time I was gunning for 480 or so attack with shout     Nope they coded that one to register as if you got the chest even if you didn't. Gotta thank the DEVs for the hind sight, other wise it would be a shame.     Aye     Pickpockets, muggers, people dashing into your house taking something and dashing out (weirdest thing ever) and the occasional misplaced wallet     This would be a great gift      Is there any *truly* self-learning software that can go from zero experience with how to train a dog to play dead to becoming a guru on it?     Wonder how much power that would require      With bard e it's 100% reproducible on the walls at mid that lead into the river, you will float up pretty high and back down, it's not a major thing though bc is issuing a move command sends you immediately back to the ground.      I would go in as an engineer, if no one spawned I would hijack it, if some one spawned shoot the cockpit, if I failed use a rocket launcher to blow it up.

Fun fact my first 3 kills in a jet in BF3 were roadkills due to me failing on learning how to fly it.     BF3 is notorious in my play throughs for enemies riding jets/helicopters to the enemy base and destroying the enemy aircraft on spawn until they can steal it.     That really perked my interest, that and cutting down trees to make a path, and the shieldboarding     For banks they need to update for security reasons no?     I heard that the online community is very nice. How hard is it to climb ranks? How much is the fee? And how does the actual battles compare to monster hunter MP? Or is it closer to turn based XII?     FCC didn't get gutted yet     I remember googling Comcast customer service once would bring up images of Nazi swastikas.     What's the pros, cons, and compare it to monster hunter     X, it's fairly linear so you can't mess up too bad; if you want open world go with XII, you can go to so many places and the story of each place is pretty interesting     Thanks     We cleared the asbestos ourselves for the home we live in, didn't follow all safety procedures but close enough. If you have the time, and I mean a good deal of time, it's not too difficult to clear it yourself and lay a new ceiling.      Thanks     Welp I now want to know (also just starting out)     The other guy just flew     I honestly thought mid-sized was 100k vs 120k or so battles but that's bc I play on modded super galaxies that are like 10 times bigger the default option. (I don't really play late game, just que a bunch of things and go eat)     They live off energy, so they squeeze a planet dry of all forms of energy. Chemical energy too I assume, so humans are fair game.     Could you lead them to your enemies?     Dam same model as mine     Nice job     First 2 min I thought so as well     Who downvoted you?     It's giving me ""page not found""     So it's kinda of ""I fixed it, but if it breaks again not my problem"" (I have 0 expirance with JavaScript.)?     I enjoyed this thank you     I'm also a bit lost     Was such a word really used?     Dam it you triggered the auto-mod     He is mentioned in various other texts, so he did exist historically but just as Jesus lived historically it's the what they did with their lives and their meaning that is in doubt     Weren't there more than one Judahs in the Bible? Mayhaps something to do with the historical kingdom of Judah?     I just this BSB and now only if I could get shout...     Without his burst is hopeless  Stupid and funny stuff you do in FFRK...  Do you ever do some things that make you feel stupid? Like bring a fire focused team with chain firaga and the like vs ifrit? I had just made a mage team vs Dark Bahmit with everything working out until Dark Bahmit self-castes reflect and I realized that I don't have a dispel, despite the battle description saying he casts reflect. I had to laugh at my self for that one. Any one else has such stupid funny moments to share?  Just as I was about to go for a 11 pull on the lucky draw...  ... servers undergo maintance. And I was grinding and refilling stamina all day and then for a hour+ final stretch. Got 50 mirthyl, already in the relic draw screen... boom maintance notice.

Maybe it's a sign that I shouldn't pull, my last 6 or so pulls were trash 1/11 pulls. Think I should pull for the lucky draw (I lack good mage BSB), go for the tactics (I don't have shout and have shit tactics synergy), or save?

Edit: thanks for the advice, I will save for later.  How and why does one lose their appetite?  [removed]  RAGE DAM THIS  [removed]  Please help with torment boss  I've tried many things, lv 75+ mage team, 4 white mages and Titus with his BSB (because I have a shit ton of medica relics but not much else), 2 white mages and 3 lv 85-99 fighters, I just can't beat it. I have enough grouth eggs to take 2 characters from lv1 to lv 99, and the spread crystals to break level caps, just tell me how to beat this thing!
The water fish one (gusinio?)  Terra OSB good?  I have terra OSB but I only use her vs bosses weak vs fire, and in my mage A-team. Is she good enough to justify boosting her to lv 99 and using her more? I currently value Ex-Death with the SSB that gives M-blink and grand cross as better than her outside of fire vs Ice fights.

 Also what is a better RW Aerith White Materia or Terra OSB?

Edit: thanks for all the advice and comments guys  Lenna Phoenix of tycoon vs Aeroth White materia  Which is better to use as a sole white mage, lenna and Phoenix of tycoon or Aerith white materia? Specifically which is better in multiplayer raid. 

Bonus points for telling me which is better for me to use as my RW.

Edit: corrected Aeroth to Aerith  Help with when to enslave     I tried to make slaves a while back and failed, so I gave up instead doing things like purging and etc. but now I want to enslave but no idea when is it a good idea, and how to maintain slavery without rebellion and etc.  Can't find ultimate mega thread  I can my beat that dam ultima weapon, can someone toss me a link to the mega thread? I couldn't find it.

That or tell me what you did to beat it.  Wall first and then Cast shell?  I heard if you cast wall and shell in the wrong order one cancels the other. What is the right order Bc I am just trying to squeeze a win on the ultimate weapon losing with 7% hp remaining.  Looking for a romantic tragedy book with preferably some comedy.  My little sister came to me for book advice and I failed miserably blindsided by thinking she would like what I like. 

She read and liked the divergent series, hunger games, and fault in our stars. Thank you for any and all advice.  Need help picking for an A team...  What champs dot you use for your A team? I used to just choose whatever character I had a soul break, but now I have a good amount of soul break equipment and while it's quite lacking (for example nothing for terra) it's more or less a good amount.

That brings me now to choose based on stats and etc. But I have little knowledge in this area and was hoping for 2-3 A team examples 

Thank you  About to read LotR, do I need to read the hobbit?  I was gifted all of the Lord of the Rings books, I plan to read them, but should I read The Hobbit before hand?   why the hell can I not colonize a system yet the AI can!?      Pretty much I messing around in one game where I all but won, had a fleet power of 200k and my tech was equivalent compared to the awakened fallen empire next door (I don't even own the leviathan DLC!) so I decided to terraform an entire system into juicy Gaia worlds and when they were all terraformed AI rebellion occurred. No big deal, I crushed it but the AI rebellion borders extended over my Gaia worlds and while I was fighting a vassal colonized it! So I loaded an earlier save and I rushed colony ships to take it first but the game wouldn't let me, due to the system being in another empires borders... However I watched my vassal colonize it moments later thinking wtf?  Federations are OP due to a bug?  I was RPing as the Dune Space Guild where I only would play with 1 planet, to make up for the pitiful excuse of a fleet I made a Federation. Federations get a separate fleet cap and when you are president of a federation you control the fleet and can add more ships. 

I just spammed built a bunch of ships for the federation until L I ran out of minerals, when I started it was at 28/56 fleet cap. Once all the ships were built it was at... 283/60 fleet. The game doesn't allow you to add ships to the Federation fleet if you are at the fleet cap, but it looks like if you que the order for the ships before you go above the fleet cap, the ships will still be produced.  Playing on the highest graphics...  I play on the highest graphics possible because of a beefy gaming PC, but late game I get like everyone else annoying freeze that last usually 2-10 sec, and sometimes during auto save as much as 1 min. If I lower my settings would it eliminate or at least reduce these ""freezes""?

Edit: thanks for all the advice, now I somewhat know what the problem is.  Ranked is down?  [removed]  Books with Chem, math, or engineering  Fiction or non-fiction just must play a major role in the book. An example of a fiction book would be The Periodic Table by Primo Levi (a story of how a holocoust surviver lived through the holocoust via his skills with chemistry)  Sectors suck  Pretty much after conquering most of the Galaxy without using sectors, I conquered and subdued a 4 planet ring world and made him cede all his planets, I did not want to bother managing these planets as since I was running individualist ethic I couldn't just purge them all, I wanted nothin other than the space ports so I made my first sector to manage these 4 planets, big mistake. After a few months while I'm in another war with a FE and 3 inferior empires, I get a notification that all 4 ring world planets are rebelling against me no big thing, I get rebellions every 5 min form my other planets but I station armies to deal with it, but the rebels on these planets were gene warriors... And all 4 succeed, with a 22-23k fleet each, my entire navy combined is 70-80k, and I am already in a war with around 50k total as my enemy... Why can't the sector manage 4 planets properly after I left it a ton of credits and minerals to develop military?      Shame on them... I'm totally not clicking on it for myself, I'm doing it for a friend      Oh wow     My area often doesn't pursue unless it's ~10+     No problem the subreddit in my eyes in one of the best, though don't post bad advise (aka don't advise anything batman would do)     If there is reason to believe that was what a reasonable person would do in an emergency is your best course of action, vigilantes often get into trouble with the law because often what they do is not reasonable. However if cops are running after someone and you tackle the culprit you probably won't get into trouble.

 for more accurate advice head on over to /r/legaladvice the mods there are great, active, and can explain in layman terms      Nah I was referring to how to this zombie looking human, sure he is kinda creepy but that's ok, and suddenly this horrifying monstrosity pops up 

It's my first DS game, and I stopped playing after hitting me my first OH WHAT THE !!!!!!! zombie dog.      Some of us are not dark soul material. Mid way through the first boss of DS3 I put down my controller, said nope, and walked away.     Train til it dies, then train the next one til it dies. Bone-breaking work     My pupil did well     This was just a little too morbid for me, a pun and a pun indeed, but a morbid one.     I would be afraid that my house would catch on fire from the aftermath      Sad thing is he believes it blatantly without even a Google search...     Thinking along the lines of questions such as ""why did the Spanish not remove Sutter from a position of authority in California after he threatened to raise the French flag over sutters fort?""

Questions that are really specific or obscure. Overall general research insight is great.     I was in a similar situation, if you still can't recover losses, I was suggested that I could write some of it off in my taxes as ""loss not covered under insurance""  Best way to research lesser known historical events?  While it is quite easy to grab information on a well known topic such as the civil war, it can be difficult to find information on more obscure or detailed topics. I would normally just wiki the topic and find the references underneath for more information, if more information was needed a google search with multiple criteria. But I couldn't find a mega thread on researching history and tips do so and was wondering if anyone has insight and tips on research.     Bad career move     Out of necessity I once had to hook a TS cable (just call it an instrument cable) through 4 adapters t fit an XLR port. Sound quality was crap. Would this particular set up lead to loss of some data?     It's a fun fact     So pretty much like holding a mic to a speaker?     Screw that, the mechanic did barely anything and would reset often, too often for it to make a sizeable impact on draws.     I can imagine why that the solviet soldiers were well behaved in comparison to Germany      Guess some sort of mental disorder that they don't seek help with, with a few genuinely evil people.     It's an easy slip up if you are used to one way and see it another way     57% of solviet POWs died 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_mistreatment_of_Soviet_prisoners_of_war

Granted it's wiki but the sources in wiki cited seem reliable enough      No it's the ~wannacry ransomware.     To back up his claims, only around 40% of solviet POWs survived German prison camps.     ""You've got ice... and more ice...""     Weird that poison removes sap     Now ff12 intro is beast, immerses you deeply into the story and the world     Why did I know it was Seymour before I even clicked     Frankly my problem with trump is he is slow, very slow to denounce supports of his that do things like this.

I don't remember exactly his name but there is one right wing radio talk show prick that once hosted trump that spawns things like sandy hook conspiracy (Google that)

It's Alex jones he hosted trump in 2015, would it be too hard for trump to say ""screw this guy""? This Alex guy is really screwing people's lives over and more. And he is not the only one just a prominent one.     My dog was an idiot who just couldn't realize that no, the cat doesn't want to cuddle, and yes she will scratch you if you try.     Nationalism is a weird and dangerous thing, I am Russian used to have a sense of pride in being Russian strangely enough, despite being far removed from Russia and having nothing good out of it. (Nothing bad either)

A psychologist or biologist could tell you more about this, but it's little more than a tribal instinct. A terrible one to have this day and age though.     Thanks     Go be useful... this is why you can't have freedom.     Until now I was confused why a larger more powerful empire (but not by much) was not already attacking me. I just kept being a bigger douchebag hopping it wouldn't attack me just yet.     From reading some of the shitty ""tenants"" (some guy squats for a while and voila) some landlords had to deal with on this sub, I can imagine why he would be so cautious.     Does that mean as a Russian citizen I must file for Russian taxes as well?     I have not read that in years     The one gain for the Americans would be the issue of forts and arming Indians.     The Japan nukes didn't leave as much radiation as one would think, they popped them mid-air (to increase AoE) and as a side effect less lasting radiation than a ground explosion. But not saying the radiation released didn't have any immediate-long term results.     Mistakes happen, just 2 weeks ago paramedics declared a women dead only for police who arrived to make a report to revive her with CPR. If with all our modern technology we cannot 100% determine if one has died I doubt innpast ages they could.

Power came back up a little while ago  Power outage in natomas  Currently a power outage in natomas, looks like summer truly started now.     Last stand saves the day. In fact it makes the fight much easier, I clear it with 6 champs on multiplayer.

Last round was: cloud and Mif XIV, Fang and Ystol, zidane and zack. The kicker? Ystol did not have a wall (only asylum) and we still passed.     For me it opened my eyes to last stand. Before this week my Mif XIV was lv 35 and neglected, now she is lv 99 and half dived.     It should be enough, you can ultra cure the other white mage     For me it was more, the boss can do as much as damage as he wants, it will charge our SB gauges faster, and no one will really die with so much back to back last stand and reraise spam.     She didn't do as much damage but I didn't need to heal her much as I kept her in the air with leaching jump. I think dragoons are some of the best bc they can do that atm.     Why is fang considered bad (I have her Burst and over)     Ours did more akin to 9999, but we had a ""shout"" (Mif SSB gives attack up large and last stand) and onion BSB     My father got pickpocketed and he spent $60+ On a pay phone before the various bank accounts he has could be frozen (please hold dam it)

To be fair he tries to take advantage of all these open account bonuses     My set up was lv 99 Firon BSB, lv 99 Ramza shout/chant, lv 82 Faris USB, lv 80 Cait Sith toy soldier, and lv 99 Aerith BSB. RW wall

Pretty much I debuffed the crap out of the boss and (should have) took my time to build SB for Firon. I got lucky with one of my Firon Burst, but I recommend putting silence resistance on your why mages and screw the rest.     Last stand was a godsend this fight, bc last stand is not triggered by the (send your character to 1 hp ability) only by an ability that would actually kill. Even so the reraise was used, often, probably around 9 times total but in the end still mastered.     The OK, Cid, and to a smaller extent Vannile were nothing more than meat shields in my team.     Firion BSB is pretty sweet, I have it too     Wow the synergy      1 man team, (the cloud did 3/4th of the damage alone on my team, everyone else where more of supports)     Dismissal blade on mif was important to get rid of the haste (otherwise she did nothing but wrath)  The XII hardest level MP  Finally beat it after a 30 min battle of Mif XIV last stand, Lenna Reraise, 2 ystols, a vanilla XIII, Cloud, Cid (tactics), and an OK who wisely did nothing but use his burst. (He afked so I controlled him and the ystol). How did others beat it?     Firon II BSB, its really one of the Best BSB (instant cast, mag blink to all on team)     There a visitor center for the old Folsom powerhouse museum, I got a nice angle and fairly close while on a small guided tour.     A worst case happened     alright will go for the stone shooter banner bc I will be the least disappointed in a worst case scenario      Oh side note, is fran or mustidio better as a damage support (if they have their Burst)  Best banner out of the 4 to draw  Currently I am really looking at FFT stone shooter and Fran's burst, I would go for Fran, and the USB Pennelo but my XII synergy, while not perfect is better than my FFT. And I already have the Burst for XII gab. On the other hand I have CID Burst (and only that for cid). The other FFT banner I would love the USB for Ramza and the pole for the witch, but already have the genii gloves. The 2nd banner for XII has not been released so I don't know anything about it.

Edit: QQ, I got crap. 1/11 headband, feels bad     Last thing I want is squirrels to pop in my car, most of these squirrels are non-native too     Imagine trying to measure a tree with a tape measure. If it's big you are not going to have a good time     Oh god I remember Yosemite squirrels and I hope it won't come to that.     syphilis Hit Europe really hard     Just care, I am not familiar with new models but older models can force enough electric current into you to kill you.

Just driving through the park to reach the interior takes time, it can get congested at times.     Try local subreddits such as /r/Sacramento as well.

They often have posts or sidebars for people coming in to see the sights.     Guessing they needed a suitable punishment for the crime      The east lasted longer and in years before the breakup had the majority of the economy.

Interesting is there a specific website for sac radon gas levels? The best I found was for the country      How?     Downtown is ok, most of the streets are ok but there are some serial offenders.

This sounds awesome. What's the details on this?     Are Sac radon levels high?     Well not axis but as a semi-neutral      Thank you (that's kinda what I actually did, transplanted the engine and transmission.) overall I should be fine as the DMV and CHP (CA highway patrol) inspected and signed off.     From what I under stand the British won the battle, and then afterwards the storm hit the Spanish.

Part of the reason why the British won was their cannons were better and kept their range and during the main battle a brilliant but risky move by the British paid off:

Normally during a battle between ships of the line there is a tactic called ""crossing the T"" where your ships would perpendicularly cut through the enemy fleet, that way your port/storport cannons would be hitting the enemy while the enemy would only be able to fight back with their few front/back cannons, and even then might end up hitting their own ships...

...But the British deliberately allowed their T to be crossed! The wind was blowing at the Spanish backs and half the Spanish ships quickly crossed the T... and realized they couldn't rejoin the battle bc they would be sailing upwind. With that move the British effectively cut the effective Spanish fleet in half in that battle.

Note this is just information I absorbed from various Reddit posts so feel free to correct.     What made it wrong? From my understanding this is a grey area with no strict rules.     I learned from the same source      Now I feel like a psychopath who is a serial killer. To be fair, a good portion of them were to strengthen the cursed katana      Reminds me of Peter the Great from Russia actively discouraging beards among the nobility at one point     I'm not too sure if turkey at the moment is still a democracy or a ""democracy""     You should see the numbers for WWI and WWII east front, furthermore Stalin's purges, they vary a good deal too but it doesn't change the fact that it happened     Dude... don't advocate killing another human for their beliefs. Or belittle people's deaths for any reason.     Reraise only made him cast it again.     I used Cait sith: toy solider, Aerith: white materia, Ystoll: wall, Gabreth(Basch brother): his BSB, and Firon: weapons master. RW shout.

I had slowly, very slowly out healed and out mitigated the dmg while ever so slowly picked each one of them off. It helped to have status resist accessories. I mastered it surprisingly.     Rule of thumb is don't pull if you can clear all content for that specific realm. (I would also add pull if you need to open up more characters for different strategies) 

Plus anniversary banners are around the corners, I done how have 190 mirthyl saved for that.     Stalin was a manipulative Bastard who went from somewhat paranoid to full-blown paraboid. Let's go before Stalin possed all the power, when Lenin was alive. Lenin did not want Stalin to come into power, I forgot what particular reasons, however Stalin manipulated people around Lenin to prevent orders and information that would hurt Stalin from reaching other ears. After Lenin died Stalin would kill off his potential rivals to assume power. He later even killed off his allies over time that supported him to power. 

Now there were some positive outcomes that came out of this, such as later when fighting a bloody war against Germany dissent was squashed and treason kept low, allowing a 'harder' response to Germany. Was it worth it, potentially the reason Russia could fight such a war? Up to you to decide, I kinda avoid what-if history.     I would think that it was free and the owner was giving it away, and then take it and disassemble it for engine parts.

subject1549,"    I was diagnosed in late May. They'd been mentioning it to me (or as it is known in the ICD-10, used in most European countries, emotionally unstable personality disorder) for a few years, since my last suicide attempt. 

 When I made the post I felt wretched but I slept for about an hour and now I feel a little better. It's like a rollercoaster in the dark; you never know how many twists and turns your emotions will take and you never see the drops coming. 

 I don't have as much of a handle as I would like. When I was a kid I had temper tantrums all the time and then graduated to hurting myself when angry, but now I try to go running. Or I whine on the internet, haha.      hey there. 

 No, I have not - I have a pet bunny though and she is the light of my life. 

 I cut myself, a lot. I've needed stitches quite a few times (NHS staff are sometimes amazing and sometimes awful - I've been told there are people with ""real problems"" and I was a time-waster, which put me off going the next time, and now my scars are pretty terrible). I started off sticking pins in my veins (really not sure why) and then graduated to the blades from pencil sharpeners, then razor blades, then I ordered a load of blades for craft knives off the internet, and then kitchen knives. I once tried to count my scars and stopped at three hundred; they are most visible on my left arm. The worst is six inches long. I did not get stitches. When it's cold it goes purple. 

  I think I must be difficult. I've very intense. Things upset me a lot (my housemates refused to live with me for a third year and I tried to kill myself, which perhaps strengthened their point).   first post. not my first rodeo. fuck, i've let mself go  hi

 been struggling with an eating disorder since 2012. since then two of my good friends have been diagnosed with anorexia. one was hospitalised and the other is so thin i'm amazed she's still at university. 

 my lowest weight is 130 which is currently 19lb away. i need to stopdrinking. i try to log everything but i keep telling myself ""oh, tomorrow you won't eat"" and then i wake up and eat. it's disgusting. i repulse myself. covered in cellulite and flab,, i can grab handfuls of my stomach because i'm so huge. genuinely amazed i don't fucking burst out of my clothes. 
 
 i am going home for Christmas around 15th December. before then i want to be 130lb. i know it's still gross etc but it might make me feel a little better. i've been at uni for a term now and only lost 6lb bc i keep binging - i live alone all my friends threw me out. i've got no excuses any more. 

 :( i don't know how i've got this huge. and every time i get down to about 142 and then binge again?! why am i so fucking weak. i used to be so strong. i've been losing and gaining the same 10-15lb for years now. i've been making the same posts on mpa for years. 

 its time. aiming for 800 cals a day - i know it's a lot but then hopefully i won't binge. might try to go sober for as long as possible nd see how much weight i lose  i have borderline personality disorder. ama!  i'm twenty and was diagnosed in May but I've known about it for years. i've been self harming since i was eleven but now i've not hurt myself in eight months. i also have an eating disorder and problems with alcohol (bpd can cause these). 

 but yah. this is a fairly misunderstood condition. hoping to change that, maybe.       i've not told him ...      oh shit sorry, I did read the FAQ! ust have missed this. Thanks  reposted from my throwaway. [orgasm troubles] my (20F) fwb (20M) takes a really long time to come  [removed]      wow, 25 years! That's amazing! 
 Thank you. Gives me a lot of hope - the general consensus when you google BPD isn't great vis a vis relationships. 

 Thanks. Hope all is well with you!      nice one, well done you !!! so proud :)

 happy birthday! anything nice planned?     thank you so much! Hoping to never do it again. Scary times. It's still more than half my life. 

 Hope things are good with you     hey there 
  
 The main thing I would say is validation. When they have emotional outbursts because it's raining and it said it wouldn't and they wore non-waterproof shoes (for example), their emotions are very real. We experience things a lot more than most; a good mood is the Best Mood and a sad mood is the saddest that anyone has ever been. And these moods might be fleeting but they hurt or they're very intense, and very real to us. People telling us not to be silly are The Worst because often we know we're being silly but we can't stop it. 

 Also the bunny boiler stuff gets old after a while. And lots of people with BPD will have scars from self harm, or a history of suicide attempts, or a history with eating disorders. I don't know if that's the case with your partner or what but often strangers think they can ask us about this sort of thing. I cover my scars to avoid it but if my sleeve slips I get drunken boys at parties saying ""woah, emo's over,"" and having a good laugh. So tread carefully there. 

 Also, and this ties into the validation thing I mentioned earlier, lots of people say ""oh, we all have mood swings!"" or ""you'll grow out of it!"" or treat the identity disturbances like a joke. ""None of us know what we want to do when we're older"", I get told, but for me it means my politics can shift from left to right wing, depending on who Im with. My accent changes. My style of dress veers from preppy to goth to mod to hipster, without ever mixing any of those elements. My favourite bands change, and my entire demeanour changes  I can be arrogant one day, meek the next, belligerent another. It is exhausting. I am trying on different people-suits until I find one that fits, but in twenty years Ive not found one yet. Dont try to pretend your agony of indecision about which uni to put first on your UCAS form is comparable.

 
We're very sensitive. We're like burn victims. And as BPD is cluster B personality disorder (""dramatic""), yeah, we're dramatic. It can be a lot for some people; it was too much for my friends. Oh! We're also not inherently manipulative. If we were it would be in the diagnostic criteria. 

  I really like that you're asking this question, go you.       it is the Worst

 also like, diagnosed EDNOS and I hate that it's never quite been anorexia which is so fucked up :/     thank you!  Sorry for the late reply, had loads of uni work / was asleep. 

 I'm on quetiapine (seroquel) 200mg a day, it's a mood stabiliser and works alright I think so far. 

 I'm on the waiting list for therapy but I go to therapy my uni pays for and it's good. Just talking about stuff really. 

Hope things are good with you!      hey sorry for late reply, was at uni! 

 Never been hospitalised; apparently there is a tendency for people with BPD to make each other worse. 

 My grandfather was bipolar (i'm also bipolar but medicated)     thank you so so much. Honestly, this has made my day as well! 

 All the best. :)      my brother was about five and my dad asked us what we wanted for breakfast and my bro said ""cereal with ketchup!"" so my dad gave him that and made him eat it. He started crying because it was horrible and he was hungry so my dad made him sit on the floor and eat it. And he had it again at lunch when he couldn't eat it, so I ate it in the end. It made me sick. Not eaten ketchup since I was six 

 why do parents humiliate their kids like this ! glad things are btter for you now     i'm thinking about dying it back to red. it was a sort of darker red really so not ginger-ginger, but enough to get my lip split     ginger person here. also very pale, green-blue eyes, freckles. 
 
I got beaten up at school by the popular girls once, because I was ginger. people didn't want to sit with me at lunch bc I was unpopular because of my hair : --- ) 
 I dye it now     Nancy. Mildred. Rupert      most i've ever done is two days. i'm so weak ! ! ! : --- ) 

  also I find it so hard bc after that i just binge. how do you not binge? i used to be so good at fasting nd restricting and now i'm fucking disgustingly huge     yep. 150 here (5'9) and ugh i've also gained 20lb : / 

 been at uni six weeks and gained/lost 15lb already from binging and restricting and i cant help thinking by now i could be 130 or even 127 and underweight again. fuck, i miss that.      the worst when it was raining or snowing and they didn't let you put shoes on     haha yeah I'm so used to hot sauce. As well as the shots I used to bite my nails so my dad used to put chili sauce on them so when I bit them it hurt, and I always used to forget and get it in my eye. 
 I had temper problems as a kid and my dad hated that. Told me he'd be very happy if I died the next day and that he'd have great pleasure burying my bones. I remember being overjoyed when they passed a law in the UK saying you couldn't hit kids hard enough to leave a mark any more, not that it stopped him. 

 All better now. 

Hope things are good with you       thank you !! stuck at that weight too : (     fuck you     :(     ahh goals      my ex did this! and pictures of himself with a noose roundhis neck. I called 999, the paramedics told his parents to keep an eye on him. This was three years ago and in the summer he tried to finger me in the park and then cried when I reminded him about his girlfriend and the fact that it was daylight and he had followed me there...

 Why do guys do this !? What does it mean?     ohh my god 

 it's so weird  ! I know people tend to be attracted to people who are similar but not like ... clones. blimey. boys are bizarre     oh wow. I once started sleeping with a guy who immediately started self harming and developed weird eating (disordered behaviour) and he told me it was because I did it and he wanted to get closer to me . . . 
 
 why do guys do this! Did you mention it to him?     also i'm bipolar and i've heard keto works well for that . the meds have made me binge and gain weight fuck quetiapine 

 thanks so so much. god. i wana be 130 by christmas      I have two cluster B personality disorders. of course i'm going to be dramatic     i wanna be 118 too, it's my initial goal. my LW is 130 ish at thisheight. when i was younger i was 120 but shorter : / fml

 thanks. been relapsing and eating better and then relapsing for years and i just wanna be as thin as I used to be fml. yesterday I ate an entire tube of pringles. for n fucking reason. and i can't purge unless i'm drunk! 

ugh. hope you're well. thanks so so much! 

edit: spelling     he got very upset when I broke up with him because I'd ""be alone forever"" and ""nobody will ever care about [me] as much as [he does"" etc.. W o W 

 also he was very insecure because I'd kissed loads of boys and he'd kissed two girls when we started going out. we were seventeen.. no idea why I went out with him haha      it rubs the lotion on its skin, etc... 

 guys are weeiiiird       very true. i am unique, mostly because i'm better than other people. i don't see npd as an insult at all lmao my doctor seems to think i need to Stop     good point. I was tired when I saw the psych so probably came across differently to normal. idek. but I guess maybe I have a personality disorder NOS? I have traits certainly of most cluster B PDs     I can be empathetic but only about a fairly limited number of people. My family for example, and some of my friends. I care about animals a lot! 
 
  It's like I can switch empathy on and off but I definitely do have empathy. 

 This was my first official NPD dx but I've been told unofficially a few times that I have a lot of the traits.   today i was diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder. I already have a BPD diagnosis. Thought this was impossible?  hi 

 I've been diagnosed already with BPD. Today I was diagnosed with NPD, as well. 

 I thought that was impossible because the two seem so different. 

 Anyway, what now? I think my BPD symptoms are going away; I've not self harmed since March. The therapy waiting list is eight months at the moment. 

If the two do coexist it made me wonder about the idea about people with BPD being manipulative; I enjoy manipulating people but never saw this as a BPD thing. I just like being in control. 

 Eh I don't want to change but my doctor seems to think I should...  ",0
subject1563,"    No, im a while male in his 20s going to university for computer science. Way off.     What would be he point of using the console command then?     Mental gymnastics should really be in the Olympics by now.     Wut     Every fucking place does that. You have to be absolutely clear that you just want an oil change and go to a mechanic you trust. Sorry to say, but the real world isn't fair.      Hey now, you're a rockstar     What if you're a porn star?     Obviously I was throwing in a small jab at COD players, but in all reality my analogy was fair. I'm basically saying that yes, COD and Skyrim are both video games but they're entirely different. Just like diving vs. swimming. Both are in a pool, but divers might not necessarily be great at competitive swimming and swimmers might not be good at diving. I don't know why Bethesda thought it would be a good idea to have a COD player play Skyrim. There are many people who have played over 1000 hours on that game, and I'm sure there's some known gamer that has put in some serious time playing Skyrim. I don't know why they chose this guy at all.     Yeah pretty much. I don't really like labels any more but this election made me realize Democrats are hypocritical idiots. I've shifted to libertarian.     Sorry I didn't mean it like that ha, I just meant that you don't need to have an attention span at all to play COD.     Once I made an illusion/conjuration mage and I would summon up creatures to fight for me while I turned invisible and just watched. It was so damn cheap.

Edit: in the arena I mean      Its not even about skills. RPGs are not really about skill. They're about exploration, role-playing and strategy. It's not about how quick you can press buttons or how fast you can aim. That's what's so bad about this. My 12 year old brother could have done a better let's play.     That's like asking an Olympic diver to compete in the 400m relay. We're talking about an fps for people with ADD vs. an RPG which actually requires at least half a brain.     It should be more like, ""I spent an entire week crafting iron daggers to level up my smithing.""     I actually felt bad doing it. I was trying to find any other way to finish the quest m     Really? They picked that retard to play the game? Why???     Ugh it really fucking irks me that Beyonce and the Obamas are uttered in the same breath. Though I guess Obama is to blame for trying to be a rockstar and inviting celebrities to the White House every other day.     TIL women are sheep and each must follow the herd, as is her duty     But the dragons are only pathetic to your power because of the deal you made with Hermaeus Mora. Depending on how much you leveled your character before that point, you could be relatively weak at that point. You just have the amazing ability to bend the will of those dragons. You might get killed in one hit by Miraak if you face him, but you just so happen to have a powerful shout.     I know this has been a million times, but the Dark Brotherhood in Oblivion was so much better than Skyrim's. Don't get me wrong, I loved the Dark Brotherhood quest in Skyrim. One of my favorites, but it wasn't as good as Oblivion.     It won't. There's already massive scandals but everyone is in their tribes and doesn't care when it's their candidate.     Why has Trump kept defending the fact that he was against the Iraq war? He wasn't in public office, he had no say in the matter, and he didn't have the intelligence that Clinton had.     Great connections and being able to afford prestigious universities is a great privelege to have, but that doesn't mean it's easy. You still have to be incredibly dedicated and be quite intelligent.     I wish I knew I could get any job without trying. Would have saved a lot of time and money spent at university.     The Clintons have definitely had people killed.     I usually go with LaBatts. It's a cheaper beer but it doesn't taste like piss.     A huge pro of being in a long term relationship.     Run on low and max out fps or run on ultra and drop the fps? Always a difficult choice.     Biggie Smalls     You should check out hentai     Stopped smoking weed indefinitely, so many people offer it to me and the exchange is always annoying. They think I'm saying no to be polite, but actually I just want nothing to do with it.     No, but about stuff that actually affects people's lives. Stuff that they should be informed about.     I made a juggernaut character. Heavy armor, block and one handed are highest. So I pretty much just hold up my shield, tire them out and hit them between swings. Also use bash sparingly to knock them off balance for a couple quick hits.     Nothing you described was blind faith. Everything is a reasonable conclusion that cannot be proven without a doubt, but is reasonable.     Thank you     Real journalism is dead, sorry to say. We only get infotainment and opinions nowadays.     What the actual fuck.      I thought you were referring the the Blood On the Dance Floor song. I died a bit.     It's ""just a theory"" to describe a heavily supported scientific theory.     Can trans/queer people please try and understand that they are not normal human beings and their opinions on what being a normal person is as irrelevant as a frog's?

Edit: this was satire making fun the original post, but ok     It clearly represents that black men steal white women and fuck them with no strings attached.     DAS RACIST^but^accurate     Yeah...lol     No that's just what happens when the government collects tax money.     It could just be changed to a Roman arena fighter.     I don't really feel the need to defend other religions because I think they are bad as well. However, those teachings are not accepted nor practiced in Judaism and Christianity.     I honestly don't care. I bite the bullet and am that guy all the time. I try and let others answer but I get impatient when no one does, so I'll answer even if I'm wrong to keep the lecture flowing.     I'm gonna be that asshole, but a Gladiator is not a Roman soldier. Otherwise great!     Be more tolerant, infidel. Otherwise we'll cut of your head. Thank you for understanding.     Plus, you know, killing gays and treating women like shit is a-ok in mainstream contemporary Islam. The KKK is despised and completely rejected by mainstream Christianity.     I love how any time anyone criticizes Islam, immediately the reaction is to attack Christianity. I'm not even Christian.     Great, more votes to farm for Democrats. We're gonna be getting people like the Clintons in office for decades.     Amazing strawman argument you got there      I know this is a circlejerk, but sjws. They honestly cannot be reasoned with. Statistics only matter to them when they reinforce what they already believe. Rational arguments mean nothing to them. It's either agree or you're racist/sexist/bigoted/homophobic/transphobic.     Islam is a religion of peace      You can if you don't buy a new console every time one comes out, you buy your games on steam sales and you budget yourself when choosing your pc. 

Edit: also if you don't buy a new computer that often and use your gaming PC as your main computer as well.     You have no one to blame but yourself for being a console peasant.     Some Wisecracking Jews?     Good luck. I was a journalism major and recently switched to Computer Science because journalism is way too competitive and doesn't pay.     But...skyblivion.      This gets posted every so often and the result is the same. No one will admit to being openly racist and I don't think anyone consciously believes themselves to be racist.     Cognitive dissonance. It's not just when someone believes things that conflict with one another. It's when someone is faced with new information that conflicts with what they already know and the mental struggle they go through because of it. Cognitive dissonance is always resolved by either rejecting the new information or rejecting the old beliefs.

 It would be like if someone believed in the Bible Genesis story, but then was shown overwhelming evidence for evolution. They wouldn't just go around believing both. They'd have cognitive dissonance and then either reject evolution or reject the Genesis story.     Not all atheists come to the conclusion for the same reasons, but I'd be willing to guess the atheist in this situation would be more open to reason. Anecdotal evidence is meaningless.     Well then, I'm ready to embrace the Apocalypse.     Well that's kind of what a fear is right? It's not entirely rational and it is exaggerated.  DAE get irritated when your post doesn't take off, but then stress out when it does?       I'm sure mommy and daddy will pull some strings for her.     Just wait til Hillary wins. You'll never hear the end of it.     I've given up in these sjws. I just refuse to interact with them. They're hopelessly stupid.     Maybe should have worded this better, but yeah I find smoking really gross too.     Applefag spotted     It was nice to see the Bills whoop on Kaepernick today     Because it sucked. Watch Game of Thrones and you'll see that you don't need a cheap cliffhanger to keep viewers anticipating the next season.     A thief tried to rob me, and while I was starting to fight back a giant came in and killed the thief for me.     Really depends on the character you wanna go with. The resistance is great, but you can also use enchantments and potions with an Altmer to get the same effect.     Father says I'm to young to use a sword, so I practice with my fists!     Yeah but losing the queen is like getting shot in the kneecap during a race.     So that's what happens when an unstoppable force hits an immovable object.     Exactly. This actually pissed me off.     NO! Gtfo out of STEM fields you fucking sjws! We don't want your safe spaces.     No, look at how long it worked for Madonna. I wish it didn't work, but this is how you stay relevant.     Honestly it's just a brilliant PR tactic by her. She can't be criticized now, because anyone who does is against LGBTQ folk.     There's no way someone posted this on FB.     Kek     Well yeah, technically humans are animals. We aren't plants. Well, those of us that aren't plant-kin.     Yeah, no shit.     I hated that post. Yes of course Trump would win if all men voted, just as Clinton would win if only women voted.

You can watch a number of videos showing women saying they are voting for Hillary because ""it's about time we have a woman in the White House.""

     I tried today to use my temporary ID, and the only other thing I had was my college ID. Didn't work at a restaurant. I threw out all of my old ID's months ago so yeah that's all I have.     The question asked what is something MOST think is real but is really fake. 


Anyways I didn't care so much that people misunderstood me. I can see that, but a lot of people were asserting as fact that I said some psychics are legitimate, and some even insulted me for it.

Edit: plus, if you read my full comment it's pretty easy to infer that's what I meant.     I hate that argument that science doesn't know everything, therefore science doesnt always apply.


1)science is not a conscious entity

2) just because something cannot prove something, doesnt mean that thing is outside the rules of science. Nothing is.

3)there are always rational explanations for ""supernatural"" events     I know that all of them are fake. That was referring to far to many people believe in them.     Yeah that's why I leave her alone about it. She doesn't make life changes based on psychics. She's never even gone to see one, though she wants to. If she was really into it then it would be a problem but we just agree to disagree about it. In my eyes, I'd rather know the truth than be comforted by something false.     Sounds like my dad. He equates actual astronomy with astrology and it's really annoying.     Maybe. I tend to stay away from the topic. She'd probably get angry at me if I did that.  DAE hate being reminded to do things, but then always forget to do those things when nobody reminds you?       Lol it's not that kind of stuff. She believes mostly that they can communicate with the dead. More along the lines of people die, but their soul or whatever still exists and certain people can communicate with them. Honestly I blame reality T.V. She watches too much of that stuff and doesn't believe me when I tell her it's mostly scripted.     Research on what? Religious experiences? There's no scientific evidence backing them up. The only evidence for religious experiences is that many people claim to have had them and there are sometimes similarities between these claims.     Yep I've had some moments spoiled for me as well. Aka the meaning of a certain character's name. It sucks but luckily there were a ton of surprises I didn't know about.     Use a mouse and keyboard, you milk drinker!     It's not going to make him more popular. Take a look at how people talk about him on social media. Look at how major news outlets report on him. Look at how many articles, blogs videos etc. that talk about how horrible he is. Half the country hates him and once he loses and some time goes by, he won't even have his base to support him. He went all in trying to win this.     I understand not wanting to watch until it's all done, but I'd make sure you go nowhere near the internet when it does end, otherwise it's going to be spoiled for you.     Why would Trump spend so much of his own money on his campaign and totally ruin his reputation for that? Look at the things he just said about Hillary and Bill during the last debate. I doubt they would want that brought up.      I wouldn't say most, but far too many. Psychics. 

I've gotten into really bad arguments with my gf over the idea, because she was watching some stupid psychic show and I made fun of it, and she things that some of them are real. She's logical about most things and very smart, but for some reason she actually believes some psychics are real. I tried to explain to her that what they do is nothing more than psychological tricks and that you can read lots of articles and watch videos that expose their techniques. 

Edit: incredible comprehension skills, Reddit. Thanks for letting me know ALL psychics are fake, because I totally made the claim that some are legitimate. I definitely wasn't addressing the original question and saying far too many PEOPLE think psychics are real.      This was the first joke on here that I actually laughed out loud at in a while. Nice.  How do you tell an optimistic tree from a pessimistic tree?  If it's negative, its roots are imaginary.     Yeah, that one was really weird     Thank you for this.     Most of the equations you get in physics come from calculus, so if you don't like calc then you won't like physics.     We call those other ones deformities      Yeah exactly. Never breaking the law is lame. Doing illegal stuff is cool. Getting arrested for doing illegal stuff is not. Same concept; you want the fun without the consequences.     How exactly would half-eaten cantaloupe seeds smell different than uneaten cantaloupe seeds? I'm curious.     Took me forever to spot the difference      Link confirmed Jon Snow. He's even resurrected.     Black people can't be racist     She's just an easy target. You can't miss her.     No I'm not being sarcastic at all. Completely serious.     Yeah because sarcasm is always subtle.     Try watching Game of Thrones. If you want justice, you're gonna have a bad time.     I never watched Mr. Show but i just binged all of Bob and David two nights ago. Absolutely hilarious. Definitely need to check out Mr. Show.     Kind of like how Batman has a fear of bats. I like it.     ""Why can't you just lettuce be right!? You don't carrot all about health, you just have to prove how smart you are!""     [this](https://youtu.be/CSav51fVlKU) needs to be played over it     It's because it's introducing voice acting into a game that didn't have it before. Even if the voice acting is decent, what does t really add to the game? You know what bowser says through the captions. Everything leads up the final boss fight, and you're ready to fight this evil creature that you've been waiting so long to finally face, and then he just talks like a goofy pirate. It's odd and it's a massive letdown. Really takes away from the gravity of the moment. Besides, Bowser in SM64 was just so much more menacing because you never heard him speak. 

Also, it's not just Nintendo I criticize. I hated FO4 for using a voice actor for the player character. Totally ruined immersion and made me feel disconnected from my character. Sometimes voice acting is just the wrong way to go. Introducing it to a series that never had it is a big risk.     That doesn't explain voice acting. They could have saved time by not doing that.     That final boss bowser in Sunshine was just all around odd. The voice acting was horrendous. Why would they do that??     It's like food. You can go to a 5 start restaurant and have the best food you can imagine, but does that mean you'll never eat pizza again?     Reaching into his wallet and handing me money     It's nice that he's getting better at commentating because after he fights Jones he'll need a new career.     I really want this game, it looks incredible. However, I really don't like how Mario looks in a city with somewhat realistic people in it. He looks horribly out of place because the art style doesn't match.     Yeah they really ruined Andy by the end of it. I hated his guts in the final seasons.     How is that selfish? Are you supposed be concerned about your nonexistent siblings' nonexistent kids?     There has to be an AMA now     I get annoyed that there's just so many holidays in general, not specifically just mother's day. But actually mother's day was kinda nice. I just don't like the idea that you're supposed to do something that day. It would be much better to just do something nice for your mom just because.     Why don't you actually read my comment. I'm not opposed to it. Just don't make a mountain out of a molehill.     Nigger is way different than ladyboy. Ladyboy isn't a nice thing to say but it's nowhere near as offensive and vulgar as ""nigger."" 

I'm not saying you can't be opposed to the term and tell people they shouldn't use it, but getting overly upset over it and acting as if it's deeply offensive when at worst it's mildly insulting is just being a crybaby.     Go cry. Yeah, it's shitty for someone to hate on trans people but if you can't handle a comment like ""ladybody"" on the internet, you're not cut out for the real world. That's really tame compared to actual offensive things people say about trans people.     *applies cocoa butter*     No it was Asian men remind them of their sisters.     Maybe, but that's not what she wrote. That's like saying goodbye Ohio, hello Cincinnati.     Has to be a troll      I mean that is pretty stupid     Nice repost      You kill animals. This person killed an animal. It's essentially the same. You don't get to feel morally superior. You don't care about animals, don't pretend you do. I don't. That's why I eat meat.     Why do people act like they care about animals when they have no problem eating animals that have been tortured and live miserable loves every day? I'm not being a hypocrite, I eat meat too. But i'm not gonna lie and say i care about every animal that suffers. It's just so gross to me to see so many self righteous cunts act like they care about this animal being killed while they stuff their faces with beef jerky or bacon. Quit acting like you care. It's so fake.  How do you tell a muslim terrorist from a regular muslim?  I'm honestly asking, because it's a difficult issue we have to deal with as a society. We can't just stereotype an entire religion, however it's no coincidence that many acts of terror are done in the name of Islam.     So you actually have a chance at losing your virginity in a way.     Don't know why you're being downvoted. Ham is salt and fat, cheese is fat. Put it on bread with condiments, it's not any healthier.     What does Rousey being a bad striker have to do with what I said at all? I'm simply saying it's fun to see fighters that Reddit circlejerks over, like Rousey, get beat.     And I'll be so happy     He might want that to happen, but it won't. He'll lose again.     I'll honestly be so happy when he does. DC fans are so annoying. ""He's such a good guy, he's a family man, he works hard, such a role model..."" It's like this sub has just become a giant PR machine for DC. It's always satisfying to see a fighter that everyone circlejerks to go down in spectacular fashion (e.g. Rousey).      Cormier isn't the ""good guy."" He's a self-righteous, insecure cunt who wants so badly to be seen as a stand up guy and wants people to like him. Dude just rubs me the wrong way. Yeah i'm sure he's a decent person, and he cares about his family etc., but once you start getting upset that people boo you, and you feel like you're entitled to praise because you're a ""good guy"" you're just displaying how fragile of an ego you have.     Ain't gonna happen. Jones is gonna win. He's a better fighter no matter how much this sub hates him.     You mean a korok mask. Casul     Unless the parents always dressed exactly the same, they'd be stuck in an infinite loop of trying to dress like the other.     /r/titlegore  Did you hear that the Energizer Bunny got arrested?  It was for public masturbation.      pertend
     Technically as in ""technology,"" since C3P0 is a droid.     Not with celebrities but people I know.      I'm not saying he doesn't believe it, I'm saying it doesn't make sense to call him Christian. Does he ask himself to be forgiven for his sins? Does he worship himself? Is he his own messiah?     How could Christ be a Christian? He's God in the flesh. Are you saying God worships himself? Are you saying Jesus accepts himself as the messiah and asks himself to be forgiven? That's nonsense.     Not really. It takes me about 10 seconds to take a piss. Not worth taking my phone out. Shitting on then other hand takes me a lot longer now.      I mean is experimenting with drugs really all that crazy? I feel that's kinda normal, especially in college.     I really hate the trend of redefining words like this. Racism is the belief that your race is superior and/or other races are inferior. No more, no less.     Are you implying Christ was a Christian? That makes no sense     Fuuuck     *gets modded to look like Woody from Toy Story*     *gets cracked over the head with a super sledge*     Same. I think it's because I can explore a game world without being bothered or having to worry about people.      Never have. Smoked cigars, hookas and even had pipe tobacco. Cigarettes smell absolutely disgusting to me. I have no interest in trying them.     Don't run for a bus, especially one that's going up at a 90 degree angle!     Chuck violently knocked her phone out of her hand with no explanation other than ""it's rude to talk on the phone when you're a guest."" That's a very aggressive thing to do. She didn't know about the illness because he hid it. 

She was quick to fly out to him once she heard about it and she wanted to make sure he was okay. This makes me think she really does care a lot about Chuck.     I really can't see Howard doing that at all. Way out of character. He didn't even feel comfortable with Chuck's scheme to catch Jimmy.     You forgot the part where Nacho finds out he is, in fact, a McGill. He has his name legally changed to McGill and begins practicing as a lawyer. He threatens to have Hector kill Jimmy if Jimmy doesn't change his name. That's what makes Jimmy become Saul Goodman.     ugh this guy is a total dumbass     Facebook is a private company. They can do what they want. If you don't agree with Facebook don't use it. That said, this is really disgusting and we should continue exposing them so this doesn't happen.     You're mixing up a bunch of shit there. All undead go hollow eventually when they run out of humanity. The chosen undead chooses to sacrifice himself to rekindle the flame. The Ashen  One was an undead who tried to link the flame but wasn't powerful enough so they just died (along with the other Unkindled). In DS3, the Ashen one is awoken by the bells.     Oh look at your face! You're practically hollow. But who knows, going hollow could solve quite a bit!     sure kid     The Parent Trap     I can't stand when faggots spoil movies like this. God fucking damn it.     *whoosh*     Are you normally this retarded?     I don't get it. Was Ralph a child?     *Checks original post*

     They're not rocks, they're minerals.     I mean this person has a pretty valid point.     We've reached a point where now it's not enough to accept other people's sexuality and gender expression, but you also have to take part in it, otherwise you're some kind of ""phobic."" As long as you're consenting adults, fuck whoever you want. Express yourself however you want. I'm not interested in dating men or transgender women. Sorry, I'm just not into it. Having preferences is fine. That's the entire point -- we all have preferences but we should accept that other people have different ones.     IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII'm just checkin in on ya. Just checkin in ya.     I think the point is that it's clearly a mental illness and that's why there is inconsistencies. I also thought that it was weird Chuck could sit in a car when clearly a car has a giant battery in it, and it powers the dashboard, windshield wipers etc. Even if the radio is off the battery is still on.     Why are you here?      I was just thinking, what if Frodo an Sam are gay? Just randomly thought of that on my own.     Jesus was apolitical. He didn't speak about how to govern. He spoke about how to treat others, how to be moral, and to get into heaven. I'll never understand why people try to make Jesus into a political figure. This is coming from someone who is atheist.     Just stop breathing. Pretty simple.     For your Mac? Who games on a Mac? /r/pcmasterrace     ugh I hate people who go try to go into a bathroom without knocking.     Emma Watson is so damn hot that I don't care  DAE always shut and lock the bathroom door even when home alone?       I was gonna say donkey is gray, but then I realized that there was that part where donkey becomes a steed in Shrek 2. I shouldn't know this.     Moondog. For some reason I really like that. Sounds like a cocktail I definitely wanna try.     Probably on the environment/renewable energy. Something like a world where we've become extremely environmentally friendly, only use renewable energy, animal farming practices are extremely humane etc., but the drawback is complete and total authoritarian government. Something like burning gasoline or using paper would get you thrown in prison, and this is made even worse by mass surveillance.     No, it's by far the worst episode. I couldn't even finish it.     Yeah I agree this really broke my immersion. They should have picked a really scrawny old guy.      defiantly

first time in a long time I've seem that and it wasn't supposed to be definitely.     How is E3? Does it look promising or does it look like it will be a disappointment?     That give me an idea actually, I could name my horses after dictators! Looks like I need to go and find new horses.     True, but ""horse"" sounds more like ""dorf"" than ""hoof"" does.      Which is exactly why I love stand up comedy. It's my own little safe space away from PC culture.     Well that's a strawman if I've ever seen one. How is not baking a cake for a gay wedding comparable to the murder of human beings?

And actually there are a lot of discrimination laws in place and currently lots of businesses have gotten in a lot of trouble for not serving certain kinds of people.

Are you saying that if someone starts up a private business, they should be forced to serve customers and should not be able to decide that they don't want to serve somebody? We're not talking about emergency medical care here. We're talking about baking a cake for somebody. Why should you have to serve somebody you don't want to? It's not like they wait for the person to pay and then don't give them service. They just decide that they aren't going to take that person's money.     Hipster is just shorthand for ""anything I don't understand and don't like.""     Gotta get that le 90's kid cred!!     Please tell me what advantages being fat has in modern living?     If you live in an area where every fucking business around is horribly bigoted and won't serve certain kinds of people, I don't think it's ridiculous to say that maybe you should move. I'm a straight white man and no way in hell would I live in an area that banned gays or banned Muslims or banned anyone on the basis of race, religion, gender etc. from using their business. I am also pretty sure this town would have absolutely no economy at all and it would be widely publicized as one of the worst places in America.  

Edit: I'm saying yes, it's awful for businesses to discriminate like this and they shouldn't do it. However, I don't think any business should be legally required to serve anybody. Name one business that has openly discriminated against certain kinds of people and didn't lose business because if it. By nature, these kinds of places will suffer economically from discriminating. You decide as a business you won't serve gay people? They're just gonna go to your competitor then. And if you happen to live in a fictional part of America where your kind of people are not taken well at all and businesses everywhere don't wanna serve you, I don't see why you would want to stay there anyways.     Then you chose the wrong area to live in. Move. Or bake your own cake.     Lol yep heard that line about 20 times. Watched him plummet to his death off the cliff by the graveyard. So satisfying.     I think the biggest lesson learned from dark souls is that actions have consequences. You entered a boss fight before preparing? Say goodbye to all the humanity and souls you just acquired. Attacked an NPC? Have fun getting killed over and over again.       I'm not trying to be morally superior, we're all enjoying a life of comfort and easy modern living.  Wasn't even really trying to make a statement this just came to mind when I read the comment and I found it ironic.     Shilling with an awfully written meme with multiple misspelled words and it has over 6000 upvotes. Fuck you, Reddit. Fuck you.     Props to anyone who tries no death runs. I would never even attempt it for any game, ever.     Yeah, [everyone](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Er1kTF3smOE/hqdefault.jpg) should eat that way.     Yeah, Reddit has a weird affinity for Islam.     Dark Souls. Bought it on steam on a sale, never played it until now. It starts out kinda clunky and my first thought was that it seems outdated, but I was totally wrong. I'm loving it.     I feel you there. I love Rick and Morty, love Archer and love Bob's burgers, but I never bring it up to people because most of the time I hate the people who talk about those shows. It's like they think watching those shows makes them interesting.     I went from being a communication major to computer science and holy shit what a different crowd.

 Communication was totally wrong for me and was a stupid major, but I do miss being around people with social skills, even if some of them are as dumb as bricks. 

If only there could be more mathematically inclined and computer literate people who could actually socialize. There's only a handful of people in my major that actually speak during class.     A scorpion. Absolutely deadly but with a pair of boots and good timing I could crush it.     I mean it's hard to say that he got the joker totally wrong because there are multiple jokers. He obviously was chaotic and there were definitely a few humorous moments, but clearly he was a deranged and dark joker. I just think of Ledger as a different take on the joker, I wouldn't say a bad joker.     I mean any good villain is relatable. Just because you can see where he's coming from, or he seems to have justification for what he does, doesn't mean he's evil. When a character's morality boils down to the ends justify the means, they're pretty much always evil.     Am straight white male. Don't want to eradicate minorities.     Just commented that!

subject1565,"    I don't think that's a stupid question at all. Not everyone on these forums are pro traders, and questions like this benefit numerous people.      Agreed. Stockhouse is more appropriately called Shithouse, due to all the spamming and pumping that goes on there. It's a total jungle and you have to be VERY careful about what you believe. I actually think this subreddit is a better place for real discussions than those bullboards.     Having $1MM by the age of 34 from investing is called gambling and getting lucky, not playing it safe. Keep that up and he will be 36 and back with his parents.      That sounds like OAS, or Old Age Security. You do not pay into his directly like CPP (Canada Pension Plan) as it comes directly out of the general revenues of the Gov of Canada. Funny thing is, if you have more than $70K in total income or more when you you get it, the government starts taking OAS back from you because you are too rich.     So not being depressed means you're happier. Got it! Who the fuck 1) thinks this shit up and 2) actually reports it as if they have made some miraculous discovery?      Used to Valet at fancy steak houses in T.O. back in the late 90's, early 2000's. We had a regular who was fairly well known to be affiliated with the mob, and he kept a 9mm under his seat. I think of all the times I parked his car, and reached my hand under the seat to see if it was still there. It wasn't until years later that I realized I had put my fingerprints all over the damn thing many times.      Little Johnny's dead and gone, he won't be seen no more. For what he thought was H2O, was H2SO4.   Did any of the German machine gunners who shot Allied forces during the beach landings on D Day ever get interviewed?  I know it was war, but one would have to think the human element is still there in some form. To carry the burden of knowing that you were responsible for so many deaths that day cannot have been an easy thing. We hear so many stories from the Allied perspective, but I would be very interested to hear from the Germans too.      How can i upvote this more than once?     I don't know where you live, but in Ontario our teachers are overpaid (in some cases grossly) and the quality of education is less than stellar. I think the problem with paying teachers so much is you can end up with an education system full of people who just want the money, as opposed to a system full of teachers who are genuinely interested in the success of our future generations and who love to teach.      After this long, Fowler had better arrange a goddamn ticker tape parade down Yonge Street for the announcement.      ""Um we object to the term urine-soaked hellhole, when you could have said pee-pee soaked heckhole.""     Okay, thanks. What's a cross-buy?     I recently purchased a PS4 and loved BF4 so much that I bought it again, however, none of the DLC that I bought for the PS3 version was there. Am I just SOL?     Perfect! More Speights and sausage sizzles for me.      The last part of your reply to me really isn't necessary at all, and completely ruins your credibility. Citing news from 3 years ago is also really stupid. Have a lovely weekend.      Prove that it isn't HC. You made the comment that Fowler et al are terrible, so the burden of proof is on you!     I don't disagree at all because he is. Technique-wise KWS is a very good guitarist, I think, but some of his solos rip off SRV almost note for note at times.     His fingers were like sausages as well. Most people just don't have the finger strength that he had, which is also why his strings were so heavy and added to his unique sound. You have guitarists like Kenny Wayne Shepperd who do a good job of keeping his style alive, but his true sound is all his. RIP Stevie. 

By the way, for those SRV fans  who have not seen his El Mocambo show, it's a must watch. Yes, he was drugged off his head, but it's one of his best shows in my opinion.       Hungry Hungry Hippo. I would love to see Trump's hair after an intense battle against China and Russia.      You are an asshole. I'll bet that's you in the video trying to incite a reaction from the cops just so you can have it on camera and then point the finger in anger. What reason was there for the guy (you?) in this video to do what he's doing other than to try and capture a ""gotcha moment"" against the cops. A shameful and pathetic way to live your life, and it speaks more about the type of person the guy in the video (you?) is, than it does about the cop who has to deal with assholes like that all day every day.     From what I have read, using a persons breath is not effective. The test must be done using saliva. There are one or two companies in Europe currently pioneering a roadside, saliva based test IIRC, but the names elude me. The test is a simple swab of the mouth which is then run through a small machine carried by the officer. I will look for the names of the companies, unless anyone else here knows what they are and can fill in the gap.     The minimum age recommended by the task force was 18, because they know that 18-20 year olds make up a HUGE segment of the market. If you make the age too high, a large segment of the market continues to buy from the black market, which is what the government wants to kill.      Do whatever you need to do to ensure this sub does NOT become like the weed forums on Stockhouse. They are full of spam, pumping, bashing, fighting, name calling and downright lying. There is one good post for every 20 sometimes and it's a total mess. I don't know how you prevent that, but hopefully someone does.      Picking THE weed stock that will do the best is tricky, and whichever one(s) turn out to be the winner(s) will be accompanied by every shareholder saying ""I told you so"". At this point, if weed is your interest, then owning a diverse mixture of the bigger names may be the best way to start that way if one fails you have other exposures. In my opinion those are Aurora, Aphria, Canopy to start, with other names like Supreme and Organigram being close runners up. No doubt I have missed a few, and hopefully others can add to the list with any I have missed. There could likely be further consolidation in the sector too, so keeping an eye on a few smaller names with potential could be a good idea too. 

The companies who can produce for the lowest costs, and who get a license to sell oil should do well, as oil sales could be very valuable to the company as not everyone wants to smoke cannabis, and oil typically sells for more than dry bud. 2-3 times the value of dry bud if I understand correctly. 

I would say the biggest thing to be aware of going into these stocks is that they are volatile at this point, so you have to willing to stomach the ups and downs, which isn't always easy to do. 

Hope that helps and good luck. You have lots of company along for the same ride.     Good idea. Do it! Post it to the personal finance sub and you will have a proper answer to every question in no time.      I emailed IR today too and got the EXACT same response from Zach as well. Word for word the same email. I suppose that was to be expected.     Sold...or the seller removes the offer. It is common for traders to put up psychological barriers like this and then pull them before their filled. Not saying that is the case here, but it does happen.     Got it. Thanks. What if I wasn't being sarcastic?     What does that mean? Sorry, I'm new to this.      Analyst ratings are largely horse shit, and are to be taken with a grain of salt. The ratings are driven more by the amount of equity financing and bought deal business the company has brought to the bank than it is the actual direction of the company. It's amazing the number of times a bank has a BUY rating on a stock they have just raised money for. Not trying to be cynical. Just my observations.      In my opinion only.....technicals have taken on a much bigger role since the markets have become more and more dominated by computer trading and algorithms. The chart patterns are plotted, and the potential outcomes based on the formation or lack of formation of said patterns are then plugged into the trading instructions. This is why trying to time the market is seemingly more difficult and why the market seems to move so much faster. It's not everything of course, but it's more important now than before.      Waaaaaaayyyyyyyy too early for it to mean anything.       Yes, I believe they matter a lot, especially in between material news flow. Not to mention how much of the market is driven by computers now, which rely much more on technicals. But I am no guru and would welcome other opinions.     Bingo! Trying to trade the swings is dangerous because as soon as you get on the wrong side of just one trade, you are immediately trying to correct your mistake, which brings emotion into it and often leads to more mistakes. Learned that one the hard way.     Looking at all the charts yesterday, a surprisingly large number of stocks are sitting right on their 50day moving average, so today will be an important technical session imo. If the moving average provides support that's bullish, if not then we're heading down further. Personally, I would like to see the stocks open down, break their support just enough to scare everyone into selling only to reverse higher and close positive. For those with cash that presents a good buying opportunity and to me that would signal the bottom for now.     Great little town and golf course too. I am Canadian, but lived in CHCH for 7 years and used to come up to play the Kaikoura Open golf tournament a number of times. Best seafood around, but could barely stand the next day after too much piss the night before, so the golf was less than exemplary. Some of the kindest people in the world too.     Dammit! That's what I wanted to say. You take that back right now.     Was gonna post something similar. On the left you have a the ultra clean diet, never smoked, probably doesn't drink, world class athlete while on the right you have t guys who have drank, smoked and injected anything they could get their hands on. At the time of this photo I wonder who was ""more successful""?     Yeah....real fucked off his face in that photo.      I know the owner of Weed Man....I mean the whole goddamn thing, and he is the nicest, most honest person you will ever meet. If you have feedback on one of the franchises, email the company.     Having been through multiple lawnmowers, including using gas stabilizer, the ONLY thing that I have found to work, and have also had suggested to me by the people who I have had work on previous lawnmower engines, is to use the high grade gas. Here in Canada they suggest the highest grade from Shell. Haven't had a problem since. Including today when it started on the 3rd pull with last year's gas.     If you are speaking specifically of SL, I too own it and love owning it. I agree that it's time will come. But they are different with their B2B model and that is exactly what I mean by being different from their competition.      Agreed to an extent. Risk does not guarantee return. It guarantees risk. OP said he wants to eventually get back into the big three. So if OP puts his investable assets into smaller, much riskier companies and they drop, then he won't have that capital to eventually put back into the bigger names. Risk management is still very important in this sector.

As for index investing.....I believe that is the next major problem brewing in the markets. You cannot have such a large proportion of market participants (both retail and institutional) owning the exact same thing in the exact same percentage forever. That is not what makes the market work. What happens when everyone owns the same thing and runs for the exit at the same time? Proper active management should and will always have a place in the market and will regain favour again after the next major crash. My humble opinion.      Agreed, but do you do it at the expense of owning them or in addition to it? ACB alone will be selling 100M grams a year at full capacity, and if they average $6 a gram, that's $600M in revenue. Focusing on oil could drive that higher given the higher revenue that oil generates. To me this should warrant a market cap many times higher than where it is currently. Maybe not though? Maybe 1.5 times sales is a sufficient market cap? If so, that's fully priced in now thus requiring something else to make the company more valuable.      Interesting approach, and certainly could work out to be right. BUT, when buying the smaller companies you take on much more risk that they cannot compete and therefore possibly end up failing, or at least not really being much of a player. Not saying that WILL happen, but it COULD. Keep in mind the massive amounts of money the big three are spending on their own expansion and production. The more they produce and handle themselves, the less likely they will be to want to acquire additional production through other companies. Keep in mind that acquisitions come at a cost premium, and as the industry unfolds and gets going, low cost will be very important, as with any commodity. So acquiring other expensive production may not be of interest. The small companies you focus on should have a very specific niche or something that really differentiates them from the rest that would warrant the investment of precious capital from the larger players and that would offer the bigger company a distinct and unique competitive advantage against the others. I think owning a core of the big guys and adding a few smaller players around the edges is what I would do.

But what the fuck do I know. This is all just my opinion and I have lost money at times and missed great opportunities like everyone else.      Who's scruffy looking?      This world of instant gratification and online shopping is not an improvement. The people who say things like were said to you speak from a position of ignorance. I'm so glad I grew up at the time I did.      That was a huge disappointment when there was no foldout. The best bands always seemed to realize this and had great booklets too.      Fully agree. I think back to all the Saturday mornings that I spent with my best friend jumping on the TTC and riding down to Sam The Record Man or HMV in downtown Toronto to buy the newest CD or (cough) cassette from our favourite bands. The thrill of walking in the door, seeing the display, and then picking up your very own copy is not something that youth today get to experience, which is really sad. Once it was mine I would rip open the plastic wrap and immediately take out the little booklet inside to see what the artwork is and if the band had put the lyrics in. I would have some of the lyrics memorized even before I got to hear some of the songs. The experience of just getting an album was half the fun. iTunes can't replicate that.      Yes they do. Any merger can be stopped and reviewed by the government. For example, why do you think the Manitoba Telecom / BCE deal took so long? Because the government stepped in. If they have a problem with a potential merger they can and do step in. Take the Allergan / Pfizer deal in the US last year. The US government had such a problem with the deal that they essentially created a new law that prevented Pfizer merging with Allergan and becoming an Irish (tax haven) company.     Big tobacco will never be allowed to buy weed companies. The government would reject the merger, as it would look exceptionally bad for the most taboo industry to seize the profits from legal weed. Not to mention, so many people would boycott any weed sold by a tobacco company that it would be a very bad investment for the tobacco to make. Tobacco companies may take a shot at themselves, but they won't buy any of the big names. My opinion only.

Big pharma should be scared shitless, as there will be a lot of people ditching pills for weed. Suffer from anxiety? Fuck Ativan, smoke a joint or put a few drops of oil under your tongue. Pharma seem the most likely to try and make an acquisition, but again, I have a hard time seeing the government allowing it, and they reserve the right to approve or deny all mergers. Again, my humble opinion.      Thank you! It's nice to know I'm not the only person who find this annoying.      Don't forget the Kiwis. New Zealander's, especially those with Maori backgrounds say ""eh"" more than the Canadians. Found this out being a Canadian that lived in NZ for years.      Not necessarily. The example of Pfizer and Allergan was an issue of tax revenue. Big tobacco buying a pot producer would also be an issue of tax revenue.     Agreed. Poor choice of words on my part, but you get my point.     Gotta tune in to CP24. Low and behold, there's Steve Anthony, one of the original VJs from Much Music.      Yup! Or the nights spent listening to the radio with your fingers on ""play"" and ""record"" for what seems like forever so you could tape just one particular song. But, when you timed it just right and got that perfect recording you felt like a God.     If I had gold to give then you would have gold.     Right there with ya. I was 10 years old when GnR released Appetite for Destruction, and I am confident that my 11 year old kid is one of few her age who knows the lyrics to Paradise City and all the AC/DC classics etc. The least I can do is introduce her to the best of the 60's through the 90's and all the great music that came from each decade.     Sad for those who have not experienced the same ""music shopping joy"" we are discussing here.      Season 1 of The Wire     If Nicolas Cage is in it     What is normal now? Good question. From one side of the table you could argue that this is it and rates won't rise for 20 years. The level of mortgage debt alone here in Canada would cripple our economy if rates spiked, and Poloz knows this. Never mind the trillions that the US government has to contend with on their balance sheet. I somewhat believe the FED has only forced a few rates hikes in order to have some ammo in their pocket should the shit hit the fan again. Imagine the economy taking a nose dive with rates at zero? Then what? How do you stimulate an economy with rates at zero? But I'm not an economist so I start to tail off on this topic pretty quickly.      Agreed. The theory is sound, but only based on a specific set of underlying fundamentals. When the fundamentals change, so must the application.      Sorry mate. Your prof regurgitated some nice books, but she forgot to teach you the most important class..... real life application. The market is currently full of people taking on more risk than they may want because THEY HAVE TO. Bond yields are in the toilet, and cash pays nothing. So from a real return standpoint, the asset allocation laid out above generates shitty, if not negative real returns. Why have dividend paying stocks done so well since 2008? Hmmm, well with interest rates at zero, along with bond rates, where are conservative investors supposed to go? What about retirees looking for that 5% cash flow? It's not coming from bonds or cash, so they have been forced to buy blue chip dividend paying stocks. Mark my words, as interest rates normalize over the coming years or decades, money will absolutely flow out of dividend paying stocks and back into bonds, especially given the number of retirees in the baby boom generation. But that could take forever. Until then, where else to you go but the highest quality stocks. Utility companies have been a perfect example. Strong balance sheets based around things people need. Given some of their low payout ratios as well, there is no wonder why they have been doing so well. They have represented the lower risk option in the equity markets for income investors. But they are still equity. 

     But the important thing was that I had an onion tied to my belt, which was the style at the time.     APH could have a good day today. Support was at $6.50 as that was the bottom of the trend line on the weekly chart, and while it broke that support intraday, hitting a low of $6.29, it rallied hard and closed above that support line. Technically that's bullish and we could get a little relief rally today. However, I believe it has to finish the week above that number to truly confirm that support. We shall see....      Hiking      Stockhouse is full of jerkoffs like that, which is why I started coming here for discussion. I am hoping like hell they stay where they belong, which is anywhere but Reddit, but I am seeing more and more comments like that appearing here.      ""You could sell sauted raccoon's assholes on a stick, and Americans would buy them and eat them.""

- George Carlin     Look at the charts. Draw trend lines and view the company chart relative to moving averages.      The only role oil has in this is related to the CAD. So if you are going short any Canadian stocks based on short-term fluctuations in the CAD you are playing a very dangerous game. Currency changes direction on a dime. Not to mention a number of the weed stocks just bounced off support, so they have technically just confirmed the end of the recent downtrend, more or less. Lastly, since when does a merger automatically result in a negative stock price? Last I checked, accretive mergers structured with attractive financing can be a positive for the stock price. 

Short with caution.      Your Oma reminds me of the teacher from the movie A Christmas Story.      Blazing Saddles.....the entire movie really, but specifically the scene when The Waco Kid is waking up upside down in jail, and first sees Sheriff Bart. 

Bart: Are we awake?
Waco Kid: We're not sure. Are we...Black?
Bart: Yes, we are.
Waco Kid: Then we're awake, but we're very puzzled.

The way that Gene Wilder delivers this short scene alone is proof of just how wonderful an actor he was. The rest of the movie is just as good. A true classic!! ",0

http://subject1577.deviantart.com/art/Not-Patrick-382870503?ga_submit_new=10%253A1372953832  [RF] Warforged ""druid"", not patrick       I don't often post, but I've always been a terrible sleep talker, the best one that I've been told about is one night at a party I had fallen asleep while a few other people had stayed awake to watch the exorcist. As the movie is reaching its end my friends told I sat bolt upright, and loudly proclaimed, ""hand of the devil,"" and then proceeded to cackle. I of course have no memory of this event, my friends still tease me about today.     O.K.  I haven't really written a lot, I'm usually a lurker with occasional pokes through the protective awkward penguin layer, but I figured I'd share this here...
I had recently gotten out of the hospital after finding a new, and exciting allergy to bee stings, and was trying to get some sleep.  When ever I would fall asleep though I would immediately (it seemed) have soul crushing nightmares. suffice to say I was not tiptop.  It was through all of this mental fog that my dog walks into my bedroom, its eyes catching the light giving it that ""I've walked out of your nightmares"" gleam and gives one single low grumble ""bark"" 
An odd mix of horror, and a sense of grand importance immediately hit me, my dog was trying to tell me something, something very important, I stared at her for what seemed 10 minutes, finally she walked around the corner, disappearing into the kitchen, I got up following after her stepping into the kitchen I look out through the glass door and out on the back porch sat my dog patiently waiting to be let in.  Taking an inordinate amount of time to open the door, I finally let her in after which she gave her little ""thanks"" bark, and proceeded into the living room to climb up into the recliner chair and fall asleep.  After that I decided sleep wasn't such a great idea.          I don't drink and no one I know drinks crown, I'm fairly certain the dice fairy leaves these for good gamers.     Life, is a great deal more than merely working, and existing, don't fall into that trap, but by all means travel, see this place, see more places!  Go and experience the world, 22 is still young, young enough that mistakes wont set you back too far to climb back, and try again.  Find happiness, and more will find you.       I saw this post a little while ago, and it rekindled memories of hours, and hours of frustration, (the kind that only a 10 year old can know) and then, sadness, when it looked like no one else remembered this awesome game.  I figured with all of the old nintendo games getting love why hadn't crystalis, so I figured I'd give it a try, not perfect, but I think good. I even joined reddit, woot!

I usually start with a base 3d rig that then gets exported into photoshop, then I'll do some paint work, and then some heavy texture work/manipulation to get the look where I like it.     no worries, glad you like, I hope your friend does!     thanks!

     No a lot of brushes, the base is built in a 3d program, then ported over to Photoshop where it gets painted over, and lastly a lot of photoshop magic with textures and filters.  I'll often use some water color brushes, and then add a grit layer for this picture I  turned the contrast way up.     I just saw yours after posting, I like it! not the hard shadows, but a lot more play and character.     Hey man took a try at the character, let me know if you like it

  [RF] Female Dhampir Rogue.       I actually had to look up who she was, I didn't know who she was.     oh, jeez, yea. hah!  that would be unintentional.     Megan was the name of the woman he left at home, sorry I guess it wasn't clear.     My name is, no.  Not that my name is no, its just that you shouldnt concern yourself with unimportant details like names.  I am beautiful, am I not? Shhh.  I know, I know, your ship is leaving, no, they are not coming back, they will sail away, because they do not love you like I do.  I didnt choose to love you, I didnt choose you.  The song did.  The song is more than me, and you.  The song is everything.  You heard the song when you were born, you heard the song when your parents told you they were proud of you, when you kissed your first girl, when you first decided that you loved the sea, and you will hear the song when you die.  It is the same for me.  I was brought into the world by the song.  Though for us it is crueler, I can sing my song, but each word, each breath that leaves my lips takes some of my song with it.  You see, I need you.  I love you.  Your song is so beautiful, I heard it when your ship drew close, and when our songs touched, well, it was magic.

I know, youre afraid, all you know is this world, I know that there is a part of you still fighting, still trying to return to your life before our songs became one.  That part of you has always been afraid, always told you that you couldnt succeed, that you shouldnt go, or shouldnt stay, or asked you maybe she isnt the one.  That part of you hates you, it would kill the song if it could.  It would create a world with no fear, no danger, it would kill all of the dragons and monsters, and turn off the stars.  It would flatten every mountain, and fill every sea, fill the sky with light so there would never be night.  It would kill me.

Dont look at me such, please dont hate me, I am not without compassion, I do not take just to take, this is my breath, this is my life, and when our songs are one, you will be part of my song, part of me.  I will forever more sing about the woman you loved before me, her name was Megan, and her hair was the color of honey, and her eyes like the sea.  Your father Curt, and his strong arms and fair voice, he would sing to your mother Alice on nights when you all gathered around the fire and tell you tales of the way the world should be.  Of your first ship, the Grey Cutter, and how afraid you were of its height and size, but how brave you were when those men attempted to take her by force.  Your life is beautiful, like a spring storm, you came on so fast, you overtook me with your waves and song like thunder rang out to me, it begged me to call you, and mine would take none other once it heard the beauty of yours.  

I fear I will not have many more like you, the world is growing so afraid, so fearful that no one chooses to live.  They instead stay on their islands called countries and wooden caves called homes, and warn their children against the sea.  They are all so afraid that even if I were to come across them, their song would be so fouled by fear I could not take them, even if I had no other.  I know others came on the boat with you, but their hearts knew only fear, you were afraid too, but more than fear was the excitement, the others warned you of me, said not to come this way.  They tried to take you when you heard our song, they were fools.  You are perfect, you are complete, you are alive, and I love you for it.  

Normally I would have let our songs swell and soar and become one by now, but your song is so sweet so full of life and living, we will take it slow, I will let you sing all that you can so that others, when they come to me, will know that you lived.  Sing to me of your birth, your childhood, your first skinned knee, your first fear, your first success, your first failure.  Sing to me of all the others that you have known.  Sing to me of your dreams, and desires.  Sing to me, sing to me!    

Shhhh, I know it is getting difficult to sing my love, the waters work against us, they move to swallow you, to take your perfectness from me and hide you in their depths, but please love, sing to me a little longer. Sing to me.
     awesome, I'm glad you like it!     Finished it up, I hope you like it!

     fair, but the LFA said she was a wild sorceress, so control might be an issue.  I meant for the blade to be a little more ""short broad blade"" but I think it came out ok.  [RF] Elf who thinks she's a dwarf       I'm going to give this a shot, I love the description!     This is so awesome, so much jealousy!  [RF] Would anyone be willing to draw my Starbound character? (Avian Male)    Chromyx for /u/Druyii       This may seem a bit harsh, but good LFA posts and bad sort themselves out.  Bad or boring posts don't get RFs, good and interesting one do.  More than that there are a slew of amazing and talented artists here, and each one of them has their own preferences.  I am notoriously fickle, choosing an LFA based on a line or sudden whim, other artists thrive on the structure and bounds of a posters request with references and color guides.
I think this subreddit is doing well, we're above 14,000 subscribers and we continuously improve on the quality of the art and LFAs.  right now things are working, and working well, there will always be LFAs that don't get filled, and those that post those LFAs may need to repost, if they don't get filled, or feel that the fill wasn't exactly what they had in mind, at the end of the day that just means more idea's brought to the page.  Long and short, thanks guys for all the work you do, and you're doing a great job.     Yup,  the LFA mentioned the character was part of the bear tribe, and I like the Windhelm symbol, so it kind of fit.     Yea,  from the LFA the person mentioned her as an inspiration,  so I went with it.     no worries I'm glad you like it!     hey I took a shot at your character, I hope you like it!

Thanks again!      Now that I've had time to think about it, and just to put the full ""nerd on"" I can see your point, where a strike to the upper outer torso would ""slide"" off and past the target, but any hits toward the middle of the chest would slide in until it struck home.  The rounded chest plate would help to have all blows strike away from home and slide off of the sides of target.  That being said, I think the ""boob plate"" looks cool, and isn't that what art is truly about?       who doesn't mind a few crushed sternums? thanks!     hah!

Brilliant.     Yeah why is that though, why isn't it a raven, when their founder's surname was ravenclaw ?      Half of me wanted to see how you'd reply, surprised you're this accepting of it - the k stands for kriminel (spelling) meaning detective. PP stands for polezipistole (spelling) meaning police pistol.

Dihydrogen monoxide:
is also known as hydroxyl acid, and is the major component of acid rain.
contributes to the ""greenhouse effect"".
may cause severe burns.
contributes to the erosion of our natural landscape.
accelerates corrosion and rusting of many metals.
may cause electrical failures and decreased effectiveness of automobile brakes.

Despite the danger, dihydrogen monoxide is often used:
as an industrial solvent and coolant.
in nuclear power plants.
in the production of styrofoam.
as a fire retardant.
in many forms of cruel animal research.
in the distribution of pesticides. Even after washing, produce remains contaminated by this chemical.

Imagine going into your local police station and claiming your ""I didn't kill anyone today"" reward.     But if you have a child, you have no control over whether it's a boy or a girl. So really what the government was paying the parents not to do is either kill boys and wait until they had a girl to announce it - or they were bribing the populace not to kill girls. That's fucked up.  [Serious] What is ""accepted"" by society today that will be done away with in, say, 100 years ?  Examples, slavery, women not having a vote, homosexuality being seen as evil, etc. Although at the time for the most part (I imagine) those things weren't questioned in certain times, and that is why it is so hard to answer the question.

He has never heard an insult like it and has to ask his assistant Eddie about it.

     I had finished it too, just wasn't sure if I'd missed something. Thanks !      does the escalation with the base game, the russian one, give any unlocks ?      Sent you a request, cheers !      Sent you a request mate, thanks !      css ?      Awesome, I sent you a request !   Looking for players, I think ?  Just bought this on PS store, servers are down so I can't play yet - I'm wondering if you can team up and play with people, and if so, anyone want to with me ? New to the game but I'm a seasoned fps player and I'm in my 20s so no squeaky voice !     Why would they do this ? 
    If, say, ps4 sell more consoles - it would make sense they would not want this to go forward if say that it is more likely that your friend buys a ps4 (which, in this scenario it is) then you would also buy one. 
    So doesn't this imply that microsoft is selling less consoles and so wouldn't be hurt anyway by this ""effect"" ? Thus there must be some other logic for them to want to bridge this void. 
    Any ideas ?      Cool, I only thought it might've been sarcastic because there's been discussion before and in this thread about firing weapons indoors and how in the show no one seems to react to it. Thought it was a dig about something else that was unrealistic. 
    Nice to know it was accurate.      Genuine question, is this sarcasm ?

I still prefer this guy.      what map mod is this ? and does the design fade as you zoom in ?   Bonjour, I am looking to have a historical French court song translated, if any of you can help. I have searched and found some translations but I can not be sure that they are correct as I speak only english.  The song in question: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJDLhajCCCE

From google translate; 

Aux plaisirs, aux dlices, bergres,
Il faut tre du temps mnagres,
Car il s'coule et se perd d'heure en heure;
Et le regret seulement en demeure.
A l'mour, aux plaisirs, au bocage
Employez les beaux jours de votre ge

Les ruisseaux vont aux plaines fleuries,
Cajolant et baisant les prairies,
Le doux zphir parle d'amour  Flore,
Et les oiseaux en parlent  l'aurore

Maintenant la saison vous convie
De passer, en aimant, votre vie.
Dj la terre a pris sa robe verte,
D'herbe et de fleurs la campagne est couverte.

Ce qui vit, qui se meut qui respire,
D'amour parle, ou murmure, ou soupire;
Aussi le coeur qui n'en sent la peinture,
S'il est vivant, il est contre nature.


The translation; 



The pleasures, the delights, shepherdesses
It must be the household time
Because it flows and is lost every hour;
And the only regret remains.
To love, to pleasure, to the grove
Use the best days of your age

The streams are the flowery plains,
Cuddling and kissing grasslands,
The gentle zephyr about love in Flora,
And birds speak at dawn

Now the season invites you
Moving, loving, your life.
Already the earth took her green dress,
On the grass and flowers countryside is covered.

Living thing that moves that breathes,
Love talking or whispering or sighing;
Also the heart that feels in the paint,
If he is alive, it is against nature.



I do not think these to be correct. The French lyrics I translated may have missed a few verses. 
    Any input would be greatly appreciated.

     I stated that in my post, my point is about the cameras. Why remove the evidence. It affects leaderboards which are ultimately pointless. Blodmoney actually had witnesses and evidence affect you in the game.      The thumbnail looks like the dogs are really high up on a bridge or walkway, and the black dog is trying to save the white dog.      Hey it's me, your brother  Why go surgical and silent ?  There is no incentive in this game to be silent or surgical, meaning only killing targets, except the fact that you're likely to get a challenge or two and guards can kill you far easier than in previous games. 


Edit: replied to all comments with the same thing to get you to come back and reply. I don't understand how you can't see my point. The cameras mean nothing unless you're going for a ""highscore"" on the leaderboard - which ultimately is pointless. You gain the same amount of XP for unlocks whether you leave evidence or not. 
  

    The newspaper/notoriety system from blood money was a was of ensuring that people were silent and surgical, otherwise they would be spotted through disguises in worst case scenarios due to newspaper exposure/witnesses. 


Thoughts ?      Legacy suit ?      She said ""if the kids were grown"", it was hypothetical.     Ah     Why did you say ""perfectly fine"" so much ?      Christopher Walken comma.     We don't know that.      Who ?      What attack ?      That was the end of a long process of gathering men. 


And no, the kennel master would've stayed at the dreadfort. There is no use for him during the journey and there is already a kennel master at Winterfell.       I don't deny that it happened. I deny that it was meant to happen.     That's what I meant. It isn't true that it was intentional.      Thanks man.     That isn't true.      Each castle has a kennel master, the same way that they have cooks, maids, stable boys, etc - they're all part of that place. Ramsay met the girl when he was young, at the dread fort. Meaning her father was kennel master at the dread fort. Likely his father was before him. There is nothing to suggest he has moved from there. 
    Also, there is no ""army"". If a war is to be fought, banners are called. An army is assembled. In the same way, if dogs are required then they are brought from the nearest place as are the soldiers.      Will these two mods work together ?      You have spoilers in your title you stupid cunt.      You can filter the list of shows/movies by ""prime"" - meaning you only get shown what you have already payed for. I don't see how this is complicated.     That isn't necessarily true. 



The kennel master at the dread fort is her father. We can't assume he's at winter fell.      I understand your thinking, but in the show he isn't from the WWII era - meaning the sister thing didn't happen during WWII. 
    Whatever the reasoning for him being what he is in the show, that exact same reasoning is what I envision, only that it takes place during WWII.      What's your point ?   Am I gilded ?  [removed]  Hannibal WWII  What if Hannibal was set during WWII and Hannibal found himself in the same profession in Germany ? Do you think he would, out of curiosity, embed himself in the regime and get close to the party in order to perform experiments and gain access to a relatively unlimited supply of bodies ? Or would he see it all as ""rude"" and leave, or work against the regime ?   Escalation killing ?  Escalations take long enough as it is - unless told not to, can I run through and kill npcs without it affecting my score ? I mean at the end of the mission there may be points but they don't ""mean"" anything in terms of xp.      could have*   Phrase ""I miss you"" help ?  I know Tu me manques means I miss you. But I don't understand why it isn't me tu manques. The phrase ""nous lui donnons de la bire"" means we gave him/her beer. I imagine that the two parts before the verb are split and the verb goes in the middle. As in, ""nous lui donnons"" becomes ""nous donnons lui"" - ""we gave him"". This is how I imagined it to work though in this case it's the other way around. (i) ""Tu me manques"" becomes (ii) ""Tu manques me"" - ""you miss me"" when(ii) should be ""Me manques tu"" - ""I miss you"" 
    So instead of putting the verb in the middle of the two ""arguments"" beforehand, the ""arguments"" are swapped and then it's put in. 
    Can any of you make sense of this ? I know I'm rambling. 

    Thanks.     A 2016 film can't have impact on films that have already been made.     Mads Mikkelsen in Hannibal.

    I'm using the extended timeline mod. Say I take part of or all of england with France, is there any way with a mod or otherwise, that I could release mercia or wessex or whatever even though those nations have lost their core by this point in the game ? 
    In victoria II you could release nations and I don't think their cores expired. Given this is a mod of a game that spans a longer period. 


Countries have cores, but the core or I think it might be the region/state that their capital is in is another type of core I think ? It doesn't expire after 50 odd years. 


Would making these ""capital"" cores permanent over the long course of the mod create too many rebels ?

Do you always get worked up when someone says something about your beliefs or is that a defense mechanism designed to avoid trying to learn anything?     Atheism is a cult, but you'll be okay.      Most atheists walk around upset at the world a lot. I know I used to be one. Maybe since you like stories like evolution you might be into the Book of Mormon.      Seems like you got pretty upset and started typing away. TL;DR: you're mad I called you a troll and you like being an atheist.     Santa just didn't feel like waiting in line for an NES mini for you.     No, you're still wrong. It's just impossible to discuss anything with internet trolls. Just planting the seed.

There is no such thing as a fish transforming into a reptile. Or vice versa or whatever make believe process you think takes place. So you just believe everything? Speciation is a term specifically when speaking of evolution. There is no such thing as either of those terms as they do not even exist.     Evolution is as dumb as Amiri King     But the fish stayed a fish  This is what happens when people complain too much about not enough diversity in stores       Coltrane.

But you don't care so it shouldn't matter to you anyway.      You don't have to be a ""user"" of cannabis. The plant can be ""used"" for more than just ""getting high"". More than one way to skin that cat.     Alcohol is purely one market. The consumer can basically just drink it. Cannabis is so versatile it's more than just ""smoking"".     Work in general would be done by immigrants awaiting citizenship and volunteers.     I did a paper I had to read for a speech communication course in college on ""why cannabis should be legalized"" the best reason I found was the United States would be out of debt in 10 years. The math showed that after 150 years we would basically have enough money to have every citizen of this nation never work again.     Riskiest day of the click     Die-a-bet-is     Boobs

The drop in homicides is mainly accredited to former Mayor Rudy Giuliani. I personally got to witness how he cleaned up New York City first hand. That sudden drop in the 90s was all him.

     Nah this was in NYC where we mind our own business for our own good...or at least that's how we  were raised. I've grown since.     I was once riding the subway and I saw 2 guys around this one girl talking to her and she looked really uncomfortable with some bruising on her legs and arms. I knew something wasn't right. I wish I could've found a way to say something then. It's disgusting  If there is a ban on muslims they can just pretend to be Christians, you know, kinda like how republicans do.  [removed]     That I give everyone ""happy endings""  Dogs of Reddit, what is the best part of your day?    Was John Lennon purposely assassinated because he wrote the song ""all we need is love"" and that is actually really all we need?

They are trying to turn water into lava?     Bill nye is panicking because everyone is realizing space travel is nonsense and that the earth is flat and motionless.     As a veteran, I really want to get this game but I hear it's a lot like the division and I really didn't like the division at all.     Reading these comments makes me realize there are really a bunch of delusional people who really believe in space travel.     You measured it?     Pretty much proving the moon is not 238k miles away or else this zoom would be impossible.     I can't believe I watched this whole video     I don't want to talk  The last mass shooting on United States soil will happen after a chick fil a employee snaps. This will trigger the end of times.

If you watch porn enough to remember details like ""necklaces"" there are definitely bigger issues at hand than the Mandela effect that need to be addressed. Like what are you doing with all the bodies?     I think the government can sue for defacing government property but idk I'm not a lawyer or anything     And now back to deliver all that gravel to where you bought it from     I am 31 going on 32 and I still say this probably at least once a year.

VMP: Reflex, grip, fast-mags. 
Perks: Sixth-Sense, Flak-jacket, fast-hands and tactical mask. 
Sixth-sense is very useful for capturing hardpoints, or flags in domination, it keeps people from sneaking up on you and gives you the advantage. Flak jacket is also useful for playing the objective it keeps you from being decimated by all of the explosives everyone seems to use. Fast-hands is helpful especially when you are sprinting around and need to get your sights up fast. Then tactical mask is a must especially with all of the tactical equipment in this game.      Work on your walls, they take a long time and only get more expensive.        Can you send me a link to the apk?     Give Me A Sign - Breaking Benjamin

     The legend of Zelda Majoras Mask      When I was a kid, me and my sister were left alone at our house while my mom was away on errands. We are sitting in the living room watching TV, when we here a knock. Thinking my mom was home I looked out the window expecting her, but I see no-one. I go back to watching TV, thinking it must have just been the house creaking or something. My sister and I continue watching TV, when I hear the knock again. This time I realized it came from the wall in the hallway. Me and my sister freaked out thinking it might be a ghost or something. Eventually we got brave enough and I went to the hall way and looked around. There was no sign of a ghost. For some reason I decided to knock on the wall, and then a second later I heard I knock in return. I freaked out still thinking it might be a ghost, I knocked twice and my knocking was returned with two more knocks. At this point me and my sister were freaking out so we ran to the garage and locked ourselves in. We continued to hear knocking so I called my mom and she came home. To this day I don't know what it was.      My dad, cuz I had to pay for all of the therapy.      The final fight in uncharted four was legendary.

Generally you can think in a specific language as per its grammar but when you try to think of the right word to express yourself, it's whatever word pops in your memory first that relates to how you feel which affects whether you need to translate it over or not. When you put two bilinguals in a room that know the same languages, the borrowed words thrown around can get a bit excessive, but ultimately they probably express themselves better than monolinguals as per the extended vocabulary and grammar allowing for a wider variety of expressions.

This type of logic isn't helpful to the survival of humanity; it is better for us to assume our actions matter. Assume the universe wasn't created (nothing created the universe): explain how there's an infinite past behind us (the universe always existed) which needed to elapsed to reach the present. If you're familiar with infinite sets, call the elapsed time ""x"". What is one second before ""x"" if the infinite past behind us is already written? That would require another set bigger than our original infinite set, which steps into The Creator's timeline or something else relative to the top of the chain. If some sublime being found reason to bestow life upon us, perhaps we're not that insignificant after all. Or if you're saying an all-power being created us from nothingness, I have no problem with this logic as omnipotence has no limits.

If the captain can convince the pirates he deserves a 60% stake for being their captain, then the voting with the distribution is only arguing about what the others are expecting.

Thus the captain would walk away with 84 coins.     Words don't count against budget. Good job reading.     Bread, bagels, rice are all good examples of convenient food.
Stews are pretty cheap to make. Black beans, kidney beans, lima beans, lentils these are all relatively cheap to buy. Nothing gets my mouth to water like a baked potato and yam or sweet potato. They're relatively inexpensive and immensely easy to make. The amount of hands-on work is pretty much non-existent. It's more or less just toss it in the oven, then turn on the oven, no need to even preheat it. Then go watch a tv show and check on it to see how much longer to leave it. Or heck, work on some other food. If you're into salads, I tend to grab a bag of romaine lettuce hearts. I usually break off each piece of lettuce one-by-one washing it under the faucet, then I ring the lettuce to get rid of excess water. If you have a salad dryer that works too, but I don't mind wet lettuce. Finally I toss the lettuce into a bowl and add my dressing. I use apple cider vinegar, extra virgin olive oil, white pepper and if I can find any in the fridge a bit of lemon juice. Toss the salad around so you don't get all pepper and you've got yourself a quick snack in ~3 minutes. I don't measure any of the ingredients, I just eye it. I know to put more oil than vinegar, and roughly how much oil to put on my salad based on the amount of salad present. You can also go all-out on the salad too if you've got the time. If I want to add carrots to the salad, I grate them on a cheese grater to get them to a nice shape. Cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, and an avocado are all nice additions. I'm personally a fan of grating broccoli into my salads if I can find any in the fridge. I'm not a fan of feta cheese, but I know they do well in salads. You can also add things specific to your palate as well such as cranberries or almonds (neither which I like in salads but I know others do). When you get sick of salads, I'm a big fan of tacos. All you need is some cheese and some tortillas and you can make yourself some quesadillas in the toaster oven. Or you can go all-out and grate some cheese, and cook some black beans, then either add the black beans to the tortillas watery or you can toss them in the blender for a few seconds to turn the cooked black beans into a paste. Then you can add some sliced tomatoes, and sliced olives, maybe some lettuce, your favor salsa or hot sauce (which you can make separately too by boiling some tomatoes, jalapenos, onions, and some seasoning in a pot with water, then blending it in the blender afterwards), and when I go seriously all-out I cook some rice with the tacos so I can add some rice to the tacos. It's all worth it, it's my favorite time of the week as it's the one time I feel literally stuffed and satisfied from ""real"" food unlike the stomach ache you get when ordering a pizza and eating most of the pie. Homemade pizza can be fun to make too, but the cost of the cheese I've found unbudget friendly. But if you were planning on ordering a pizza, it can be loads cheaper to make it yourself. 3 cups of white floor, a packet of yeast, a cup of warm water, a tablespoon of olive oil, a teaspoon of salt, stir it together and toss it into the bread mixer. Make sure you use the heavy duty spiral-looking head and not a weak cookie mixer head. Once mixed, put it onto a rolling pin pad, and roll it into a rectangular shape that can fit the cookie sheet. When the shape is about right, spray the pan with canola oil and lay the dough onto it. Stretch the dough on the sheet to fit it better, when it comes in contact with the oil it makes the dough easier to stretch. Stretch it diagonally until it fits the sheet evenly with some room to form the crust. Then proceed to shape the crust with your fingers. Once formed, pull out some pizza sauce, marinara sauce, pasta sauce or anything of the like. Straight tomato sauce or tomato paste are poor choices. If you want to make your own, a good sauce uses a combination of many such ingredients best prepared in a pot and cooked first. Once you got the sauce on the dough, grab a spoon to help distribute it evenly. Finally, grab your cheese and distribute it evenly on top of the sauce. You can grate your own cheese to save some money. Toss in into the oven at 400 either the middle or top rack. Do not put it on the bottom as it's too close to the heat source and will cook your crust faster than the cheese. Once the cheese gets golden brown, pull out the pizza with a glove and put it on the stove. Let the pizza sit for 5 minutes before attempting to cut it lest the sauce and cheese go everywhere. Finally cut with either a scissors or a pizza cutter. A pizza cutter can scratch up your cookie sheet, if you had a cardboard box delivery style you'd cut it there, or you can cut it on some other surface you don't mind ruining. In my experience a scissors cuts homemade pizza better. And finally enjoy. Some other low budget things you buy are pita, they are extremely cheap. You can then proceed to pour some sauce onto the pizza and top it off with some cheese, toss it into the toaster oven for a few minutes and presto instant personal pizza without hardly any work. You can also buy pre-made crusts in many supermarkets to work on your own pizza. But pizza can get expensive on a low budget. But if you needed pizza, you can do it cheaper rather than over spend. One of the cheapest ways to eat is to just find whatever is laying around the house and find a way to use it before it goes bad and has to be discarded. Perishables in the fridge are a great example of this. Eggs are a great example of something inexpensive yet healthy and full of protein (6g per large egg). As a big fan of broccoli, you may be surprised to find out it contains 2.6g of protein per cup of chopped broccoli. Nowhere in the ballpark of eggs (about 9-10 times less), but it adds up. I like to boil my broccoli usually in a stir-fry like pan and if I have the energy to go all-out, I'll add in some stir-fry components. I don't like putting loads of oil in my stir fries. Usually I just cook them in water for the most-part then top it off with liquid aminos about half-way in and a bit of olive oil near the end. In terms of stir fry ideas, you can toss some potatoes in the food processor, carrots, onions, bell pepper, celery, tomato, mushroom, and the initially mentioned broccoli. Then after it's ground into slices (don't shred it) toss it into the stir fry pan. Last, but not least, if you're on a really tight food budget, why spend a penny? You can eat over at a friend's and make it their problem. Go on a date and make them pay. Show up at a party and eat for free. Visit some family. You don't have it do it every night, if you did it every once in a while it adds up if it saves you a trip to the store, you do the math. Another idea worth considering is growing your own food. If you have a neighbor that grows their own food, you can do some organic food swapping. There's food for your belly without spending a cent. Snacks have a history of putting a hole in my pocket. I've found it's great to prepare trail mixes and other such snacks with ingredients like rice chex, walnuts, cranberries, and if you got a sweat tooth: m ms. You can make this stuff yourself and just toss it into a ziplock bag. If you reuse the same one often, you save money. You can also use tupperware to store it in. Finally, you'll find it's great to make a smoothie here and there. Totally worth the effort. If you have a grapefruit, orange or lemon tree, it will save you some money so you can make them more often on a low budget. If you have a neighbor with such a tree, you can probably get such product either free or very cheap from them. In my experience you can get it free if you keep in good terms with them. I hope you've found my input insightful. Happy budgeting and a good day to you!     It's ok to be a ""bad"" developer if you know how to make ends meet. When stuck consult stackoverflow or google. What's more important, though, is building a portfolio. When you have something to show for so people know what you do, then they're able to properly utilize you. Either a personal site, github projects, or both are great ways to get started. Finding work can be tricky. I'd suggest make a business card and hand it out to people you meet. Anyone can find someone remote to work for them, but if you're able to meet in person, you'll have that much more success as a developer. If you want to be a remote developer, it's still possible, upwork.com is a good place to land some easy beginning projects. Landing your first job there can be tricky, take a bunch of the tests there to show your skills, and offer your rates rather low, and you'll have a shot at that first project. That first project can take a while as other people can also bid on projects. But once you land that first project, you'll be more hireable on there. Some of my best early jobs as a web developer I landed through message boards. When you give people a free taste of your skills on a message board and they need an extra hand, they can come crawling back to you offering cash. That's how I started personally. Linkedin is another way to land a job. Craigslist has some really good stuff if you're willing to go meet the person.  Once you get hired, you'll learn all the skills you need along the way to preform better on the next job. Start low, and build up your profolio. When you have a decent-looking resume and porfolio, you can land some of the higher-end jobs down the line.     Correspondence has really improved my chess as it helped me understand the main ideas in various lines. I'd stay away from speed chess until you understand chess better. One of the things I enjoy a lot is chess.com's tactics trainer. It's helped improve my tactics in chess greatly. But chess isn't all about tactics. I used to think it was 90% tactics or so, but not every position has tactical potential. My newer understanding is it's about half tactics and half positional play. But no matter how strong your chess game is, if you blunder on any move, you pretty much blunder away the game if your opponent doesn't blunder back. (Generally it's a good idea to push pawns when down in material for a shot at a queen.) But yeah, you can get your rating pretty high by simply not blundering. If your opponent threatens mate in 3, make sure you see the threat coming. If they move their queen threatening mate and a piece at the same time, they've just won a piece. Keep your eyes open for such moves. If your tactics are weak, you can improve your game by limiting your opponent's tactical potential. If your king is on the same file as your opponent's queen or rook, you should be worried about tactics. If your king is on the same diagonal as your opponent's bishop or queen, you should be worried about tactics. If your opponent's knight is anywhere near your king, you should be worried about tactics. Knights are by far the trickiest piece in the game. They are essentially a short range piece, and if you miss a combination, they can jump all over the board making various threats until 3 moves later you find them forking your king and rook. Another thing to look out for is pawn storms. If you're about to castle on the king's side and your opponent has already advanced some pawns close to where your king is going to castle, you should reconsider castling in that direction. Once a pawn gets too close to your king, it will wind up either ruining your king's pawn structure, or trading off the pawns that protect your king from checks. Once it's possible to check your king, you need to be on the constant look out for forks and mate threats. In the event that the pawn structure near your king gets broken, make sure to trade queens. Once queens are traded, the king can sit relatively close to the middle of the board without many problems. There are also other areas of chess worth noting. Generally you want to develop all your pieces toward the center of the board. When it comes to the bishops, you want to make sure they always have a diagonal. Never trap a bishop in by your pawn structure, especially on the side you want to castle. Keeping your king in the center is probably one of the worst mistakes you can make in your opening. If you keep your king in the center, all your opponent has to do is trade a bunch of pawns in the center to open up your king. If you can't get your bishop out, your king won't be able to castle and be in the line of fire. There are two ways to develop a bishop as there are two pawns which block it in. Once either pawn is pushed, the center pawn or the knight pawn, then you develop your bishop either toward the center, perhaps pinning a knight, or you can fianchetto the bishop taking on the longest diagonal on the board. Every player has their weaknesses, and it's important you identify what they are. Some players lose in the opening, some lose in the middle game, and others lose in the endgame. Try to keep record of where you lose the most. Generally the opening is best to learn first as if you blunder in the opening you've lost the game before even being given a chance to play the middle or endgame. Picking an opening can by tricky, but it's important you understand the main ideas in whichever opening you choose. Even if you pick a very weak opening, as long as you understand the main ideas behind it, it's playable. I personally play a solid game from a large array of openings. I generally try to play openings I think my opponent won't know to take them away from their strong-suit. But being able to play off any opening requires lots of practice. I tend to favor hypermodern openings. Many players fail to understand them, if space gets too cramped trade some pieces so you have room to move your pieces around.  The nice thing about hypermodern openings is they can transpose into pretty much any kind of opening such as the queen's gambit or Ruy Lopez. If you don't know either of those, start there. The sicilian defence is a common response to e4, if you don't want to have to learn it, keep away from e4. A common beginner mistake I see is trading off material too early. There's a saying ""to take is a mistake"", obviously this doesn't apply to taking back, but the concept is that if you take your opponent's knight with your bishop and they take back with their other knight, the idea is that they just developed another piece while taking back. It can be hard to understand as it's your move again and you can just develop another piece, but ultimately a move consists of two plies (your move and their move) and when you had a developed bishop and they had a developed knight, after the two ply move is over, you've ultimately traded your developed bishop for their undeveloped knight. Once you develop another piece, it's like you lost a tempo with your move. Sure, trading is fine if it achieves a goal worth the tempo loss in development, but if you successively trade both your bishops for both their knights, you're just developing their pieces, not to mention throwing away the bishop pair. Throwing away the bishop pair is fine if you're playing in a closed position and knights are preferred, but ultimately chess is a game of harmony of colors. Losing a bishop means you become that much weaker on that color. So unless your pawn structure accounts for the bishop loss, or you can adjust it shortly after the bishop loss, losing your general of that color only weakens your other bishop. If your bishop is stuck on dark squares, your opponent can put all their pieces on light squares to make it completely useless. If you've got a light bishop and a rook pawn which promotes on a dark square, you can't check the king out of the corner if he manages to get to the corner to be able to promote the pawn to a queen. Even the bishop pair is weak in closed positions. One of the greatest advances of the bishop pair is trading it off in the right position for a nice tactical combination afterwards. But yeah, chess is maybe 50% tactics, work on those so you become a better player. Know when NOT to sacrifice a piece. It can get frustrating when your opponent is able to guard against all your attacks. Attack with all your pieces, then re-position them to attack somewhere else. The theory of two weaknesses plays a large role in winning chess. Much like tennis and hitting the ball way all the way to the left, then once they hit the ball back, you hit it all the way to the right, to make them run all the way to the other side of the court. Even if they run back and fourth on time, it tires them out. Of course you don't want to be too predictable, so it's nice to throw in some variations. If their stance is expecting to run either left or right, you can hit it straight down the center. Sure, they can play a perfect game, but even Magnus Carlsen blunders away games. We're all human, we blunder. Just limiting those blunders is key to a stronger game. Even if neither player blunders, you can still lose a game. Piece activity is important. If you don't have any counterplay, you better come up with a way to get some threats going or you lost the game before you even go down in material. If your opponent has a knight near your king which you can't attack, he will be the key to your downfall as far as positional chess goes.  In such positions your best chance is usually a drawing weapon such as a fortress. But I think fortresses are one of the last things to focus on mastering. As you play more and more chess, you'll improve over time. Just be careful about burn out. Sometimes you'll lose many games back-to-back and feel like a loser before the first move is played. This is known as burn out, it happens to us all. Just give chess a break for a while, maybe a day or two, then return later when you're full of energy again. Happy times, I hope you gained something out of reading this.     I prefer the former, empty parenthesis combined with ""new"" just looks ugly to me. If you want to get specific, you could use parenthesis to send in a parameter like ""red"" or ""22oz"" etc. But if you have nothing specific to add, it's just a waste of indicating you want to get specific. ""I'd like to order a new mug."" ""Anything specific?"" ""Yes."" ""Like what?"" ""Nothing comes to mind."" 
  
C++ seems to agree with me:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/180172/default-constructor-with-empty-brackets       This would step its foot into kabbalistic territory.  
The Tanya states that every Jew is composed of two distinct souls:  
a Nefesh HaBehamit ([animal soul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_soul)) and a Nefesh HaElokit ([divine soul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_soul)).

This article does a *wonderful* job of explaining them:
http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/361900/jewish/Kelipot-and-Sitra-Achra.htm

Short answer: Yes, in terms of anatomy of the soul.

Long answer: If every Jew has a Nefesh HaElokit which non-jews don't have, then if we find any person possessing a Nefesh HaElokit, then he or she would be, by definition, actually a Jew. Now if a person can be Jewish simply by being born of a Jewish mother, and every Jew has a Nefesh HaElokit, (i.e. once a Jew always a Jew), then we can enter into the territory of wondering whether a specific non-jew's mother's mother's mother's mother was a Jew. Thus such a person would be a considered a non-jew as far as culture goes (until proven to a beis din) while possessing a Jewish soul.

It is said that when Moshiach comes that he'll be able to identify all the Jews, and their tribes, etc. Many spiritual people out there can sense holiness and thus one's Jewishness. Sadly, trying to prove this sort of stuff to a beis din is seemingly futile. What are you gonna do? Find someone you *think* was your maternal great-great-grandmother and check if their grave has a star of David on it? Meh. If you can prove it to yourself, that's all that matters for you to maintain Jewish identity. If you want to be more than ""culturally Jewish"", I'd suggest the path of conversion if you'd like to be recognized as a full-fledged Jew.

But in the meantime, regarding what to do with those feelings, no matter who you currently are, awaken and embrace yourself. This sort of stuff takes time, take it slow, *really* slow. There's no need to prove anything to anyone. But as you feel Judaism pulling you in, you can take it one step at a time as Rabbi Akiva took his Torah learning one drop at a time.

I hope I satisfied your curiosity. May you be successful with your endeavors.     I second Wamp for Windows 10. Just make sure to run WAMPSERVER before Skype if you also have Skype on your computer. Starting Skype first would use the port Wamp tries to use. Once setup, visit http://localhost/phpmyadmin so you can setup a database, tables etc. (Note Wamp uses ""root"" with no password) I also second Notepad++. I used to be a fan of Windows built-in Notepad but it has issues with certain newline characters, the main reason I stopped using it as an editor. But I managed for years copying to Wordpad and back again. Sublime Text is probably a better text editor than Notepad++ if you want something a little bit more sophisticated. Notepad++ is more straightforward though with an easier learning curve. Once you get comfortable with Notepad++ probably worth giving Sublime Text a shot.     That and putting `case` in backticks did the trick for me.     If you're trying to understand where creation and divinity meet, you can skim the surface of Merkavah. It's a pretty good map of where everything is in creation to apply your kabbalistic knowledge, but if you're not a savvy kabbalistic, I'd advise to keep away from it as it can lead to hypocrisy without a strong background in theology and a basic understanding of the Kabbalistic fundamentals.

I'd suggest ""Lessons In Tanya"" to REALLY brush up your knowledge of the Shechinah, and where you draw the line between God in His essence, and what God is, and what God isn't, and how man fits into this, the worlds, the soul, etc. It's a very comprehensive book jam-backed with quality. If you turn the page too quickly, you'll feel like you missed something. Another good book is Meditation and Kabbalah by Aryeh Kaplan. It covers a number of branches of Kabbalah so you have a better idea of what direction you should continue your studies.

Sefer Yetzirah is a classic, and you might learn a thing or two from it, but I don't think it's down-to-earth enough to really learn much from it other than the divinity of the letters. There are ways to use them, but I don't think it's a good source to learn major kabbalistic concepts from in a direct manner.

The Zohar, in general, talks about various things, and ties them into the weekly Torah portion. Sadly not all of the Zohar pages were preserved, and generally one should work their way up to the Zohar. It tends to be quoted a lot though in other books, but most people, even the savviest kabbalists out there, admit to understanding less than a small percent of anything in there. It can be a good book to skim if you know what you're looking for, but otherwise be ready to feel lost when reading it. As you become savvier and savvier, the Zohar should start making more and more sense to catch the main ideas it was intending.

I do have plans of publishing my own book in a few (read 8) years, but I could shed light on a few things for you in the meantime. The sefirot (lit. enumeration",0

2. What are some other genres your interested in?

Love your stuff, keep doing you 3     Not making a joke about it. Making a joke about the title, but not about the feature. Danyka is an amazing singer, and I would love to see her in one of his songs.     That makes a lot more sense.     Who? I've been really behind on this kind of stuff recently.

Would link but on mobile. 

Dreamscape - About 3k followers by now (I think), and they release almost anything as long as it's high quality. If you just look up dreamscape on sound cloud it should come up. 

Silver Skies Records - Pretty sure around 2k followers by now. Same as Dreamscape, release quality music regardless of genre. Look up on SC. 

Outertone - Not really small, but they release happy melodic stuff. Look up on SC.

     take your upvote and go  Let's Stop The ""___ Added To Roster"" Threads  Guys, it's kind of clear now that Monstercat switched up what needs to happen for you to be added to the roster now. Now it's if you release a single, you'll get added. Therefore, just post in the megathread of that single if they've been added to the roster, don't make a thread about it.

Thanks.     On bustre though, i feel like he's still producing, because he released arcade after EHAE. If there's something I missed, please let me know.     Serum is bae af.     did you not see the /s?
  [Request] Cymatics Outbreak (Only Bonuses)  I've already found a torrent link for the presets, but I wasn't able to get any of the bonuses. Thank you so much!     this is going to sound cliche, but do it like PBN. according to their ama, they get down an arrangement of the track, then spend time making each portion as good as it could be. it's the easiest way to ensure that each part of your track is good while still connecting the whole song,     fucking stop with the paid crap.  Getter vs. Cymatics       1. LUCA LUSH (that saxophone on the second drop though)
2. Diskord
3. MRVLZ
4. Slushii
5. Getter
6. Streex     you did, but now not so much: http://prntscr.com/caxl8r      I don't think it's fair to compare Kaleidoscope and this track. Completely different styles.      This already dropped...     Those chords and the ""whoo"" sample is from [Slushii - So Long (feat. Madi)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8hRRRJp1rQ), it even sounds like some of the vocal chops are from there. That's my guess.     If you're going to say something is wrong with a song, at least say what's wrong with it.
      No one at Monstercat has ever said this. It goes against everything we believe in.
 Think about it. We're a 45 person full time company, do you really think someone's 10k follows on Soundcloud keeps the lights on?

And a Stephen walking song.      And Where I'll Be Waiting VIP     Definitely OK!

On a side note, I'm going to have a heart attack from the stress of voting for the best of 2016. So many amazing tracks this year.      Pm me pls     Tried that with my brother. Didn't make anything :/     the only tutorial that i learned from was this Seamless one, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of7LXoom3dk . Otherwise i figured out everything else on my own.     i went full ""idc what the genre is, this sounds cool"" on it. could've been a bit better, but stupid me deleted the project file. here's the sc link: https://soundcloud.com/sonorousmedia/feyd-swimming-in-a-fish-bowl-dubiousity-ep     not really.  (tbh)     *cough* glow was pretty good *cough* (some of the best vocals though)     basically only produced and did school shit this week. dropped a new song though, that's always fun. ama     Posted here a while back, but glad you posted it again. Love this track.     The drop is already amazing, can't wait for the rest of the song.

     ohhh, sorry, misread title  Popseka - Heart of Glass (Conro Remix)       Melano - Don't Fight it     Song name is ""Gravity"", posted on his snap.   How to find the keys of monstercat songs?  Title says all.     All this comment did was say things a producer should already know. Quality over quantity, submit good work to bigger labels. Then it was you just self defending yourself for the shitty title. 
Also, you're blowing the ""problem of shitty demos"" way out of proportion. It's not that big of a problem, because by even having open demos, you're going to get shitty ones. Part of a label.      Spotify?     True.      Hey, I don't know the song name, but here's what I can tell you that might help:

Because they didn't credit it, it's non-copyright. 

It's definitely future bass and has female vocals. 

It's likely a more popular song, as most youtubers like using popular songs to get more views, and that way they don't have to look for a while. 

Good luck!     Same. Subtact was robbed last year when restart wasn't on the best of.       That was the Spotify link to show it was coming, not the actual song.     Why?
Edit: yea that looks like droeloe.      I love this track, but the first part of the second drop just didn't cut it for me. :/     Hey, I understand basic music theory, but I don't know how harmonies work/are written. Is there anyway you can give me a basic idea of a harmony? Thanks!     Didn't like it at all at first, but it's growing on me.      You just find a daw and start. I've been a producing for a while now, and you just have to start, otherwise you'll keep wondering where to start instead of starting. 
You can dm me if you have specific questions. I use FL Studio 12.      I knew he was at their show last night, but I wasn't expecting this.

https://soundcloud.com/skiesrec/reckless-act     Sounds awesome.      What's the desc? I'm on mobile and can't tell.      You missed 2.5. Go viral      Because not everything here is about monstercat, nor does it have to be.      Ahh, didn't know that.      TBH, it might be subtact's new alias. Didn't he say he was coming out with a side project a while back?     I know what you mean about studying for five hours :/ it's k, sorry right back     I'm assuming you didn't see that I used words like typically and usually. Neither are saying it's sure fire that it's the next release. 

Also, why are you getting your panties in such a twist over the fact someone posted a new link to a song? Honestly, just enjoy the song.      Typically Spotify links are for showing a song is coming, not for the real deal, as plenty of people don't have premium, so they can't listen to the track right away. Also, you even put the [Spotify] in your title, which is usually how tracks that aren't released but about to be are shown here.       everything looks that way, but what about fell down?     Got some remixes for a remix comp that's being hosted on one of my tracks. P good week.   Landis - Merry Ground [Future House]       Out of all the hype recently, I wasn't expecting this. But always excited for more Puppet!     BEIN HERE WOULD BE MY DESIRE     Same. Excited to hear if the whole thing will work as future bass or not.      I saw this when I went to see Finding Dory, it was so perfect to put that before FD.      Been up for a while now.      I'm guessing All the Way VIP by the tags.      The silence of the lambs.      Silence was better in option, but these vocals are pretty amazing.      BPM is 145, key is A Flat Major

Edit: Fixed   People who capitalize every word in a sentence when writing/typing, why do you do that?       Yess Slyleaf and Dumuu on Monstercat 3  TeZATalks - Pick Me Up       I love how the title says ""Tokyo Machine"", so they knew that was right, but said ""Tokyo Monster"" in the article instead.      i love the background motion in the youtube vid, matches the song perfectly.     He used the same synth in the Gramatik remix, which bothers me, but congrats anyway.      Who are the winners?     https://soundcloud.com/feyd1/hushe-laputa-feyd-remix ayy     favorite release since fixer      just found him too, I love banana street and hot chocolate.

To be honest I'm not really sure, I'm just throwing my best guess. As to talk about that people die because not enough people prayed for them, I don't think that's how it works, when a person dies it's already been predestined for him or her to die, that person has already done it's mission in this world so he or she can go on and improve itself in the afterlife.     The more prayers from many people the greater the effect.     So can she perform auto-cunnilingus?     Fair enough of a reply of a non believer for me.

Just remember my words for the rest of your life, that there will be a moment in your life that you'll be hopeless and in a need of help and God will be there for you, you'll just have to call out to him. If you don't believe in God, well it doesn't matter, God believes in you and loves you all the time. Trust me there will be a moment in your life where you will be in lots of trouble, and that's how you'll find God. I'm not forcing you to do anything about what I've just said, don't look at Christians as a crazy stupid people who are trying to force you to convert to their beliefs, of course there are many of people like this, but there are also lot of people that are loving others and spreading peace around them.     https://youtu.be/gKyQJDZuMHE

Rick Grimes     Incredible! It's unfortunate that people sometimes need proof to believe in higher power. If there aren't any proof, it doesn't  mean it isn't there, sometimes you just have to have a little hope in your life.     Why hate on religious people? Don't you want to have some hope in your life? As to talk about that there isn't any proof that after life exist, actually there's a small proof, but still no one would believe it..

rolling back to 1511 aka THE STABLE!     Interesting case. I have just installed version 1703 (15063.138) and the folders still open slow. Now, what is interesting about it is before I had deleted that appdata folder I had Internet Explorer on my windows, when I deleted that folder, I noticed that I have Edge now, so maybe somehow, someway windows got updated then? I don't know, have no idea... maybe the 1703 version has this slow opening folder problem... I don't know man windows is confusing...     So if I encounter major gaming performance issues with creators update, best would be to install most recent version to it which is 1607.     [Yeah I'm no way in hell getting creators update](https://youtu.be/mXwPbVC5Cqg?t=1m29s)     And overall what version would you recommend? 1511, 1607, 1703?     http://i.imgur.com/9UOtktP.jpg  
I'm not able to do an update, maybe it's because of torrented windows or that I've been using donotspy10, but now disabled it.     Damn, I f#cked up hard..  
I'm creating bootable usb with latest update now, let's hope it's not that bad for gaming as I've heard..  Windows 10 folders opening slow  This was few months ago, don't mind the text in the video, this was from another issue.

You definitely can see the difference. The os is installed on a 250gb Samsung SSD. Sometimes I don't understand windows 10...  
Few days ago I have accidentally deleted appdata folder which contained about 20gb of data, maybe that is the cause of this issue?
Please help, windows 10 is driving me nuts...  
Winver: https://i.imgur.com/6yVeYWa.jpg     My priority is stability over more frames.     Shadowplay is disabled, I have limited the fps to 60fps, streaming or no streaming almost the same experience, tried render.ahead 1 and 2, 1 frames feels a little better.  Battlefield 1 Stuttering/fps drop/tearing  I don't really know the difference between those three terms, but all in all it's not very pleasant experience. I'm sorry, I know there are thousands of threads like mine, but please try to help me with this problem.  
I'm really tired of these fps drops, what is causing them? When I was buying my high end PC I thought that I could finally forget all those lags and low settings, but no...
Actually, I was having a really stable frame rate and was streaming my gameplay everytime I played, but few days ago something changed. Now I'm getting really terrible stuttering/tearing while streaming and similar experience when not streaming, this wasn't an issue few days ago, I was happy streaming 64 players map.  
**Possible causes:**   
1. I was messing with GPU clocks and voltages in MSI afterburner. Now I have reset everything to stock.  
2. First time I experienced that unstable frame rate is when I tried both streaming and recording at the same time with obs. I was like, nah this is too laggy for me, I better stop recording, but the frame rate stayed the same after resetting everything...  
**What I tried to do to fix it:**  
1. Uninstalled and reinstalled the game to System SSD instead of HDD.  
2. Tried different in game settings, limit fps to 60 (without the limit even worse)  
3. Put these lines in user.cfg file:  
renderdevice.renderaheadlimit 2  
Thread.maxprocessorcount 4  

4.Reset GPU clock to sock.  
5.Reinstalled Nvidia drivers.

Slaves were not considered American citizens and laws at the time prevented them from applying for or holding property, including patents. In 1857, the U.S. commissioner of patents officially ruled that slave inventions couldnt be patented.

And what's really sick is that the slave-owners took credit and sometimes even advertised this fact:
 His slave master, Oscar Stewart, attempted to patent the invention. Because Stewart was not the actual inventor, and because the actual inventor was born into slavery, the application was rejected.

 Stewart ultimately began selling the cotton scraper without the benefit of patent protection and made a significant amount of money doing so. In his advertisements, he openly touted that the product was the invention of a Negro slave  thus giving the lie to the abolition cry that slavery dwarfs the mind of the Negro.

[News][Link] Why losing a dog can be harder than losing a relative or friend  A review of scientific studies on the dog-person bond.
 When people who have never had a dog see their dog-owning friends mourn the loss of a pet, they probably think its all a bit of an overreaction; after all, its just a dog.
 
 However, those who have loved a dog know the truth: Your own pet is never just a dog.
 
 Many times, Ive had friends guiltily confide to me that they grieved more over the loss of a dog than over the loss of friends or relatives. Research has confirmed that for most people, the loss of a dog is, in almost every way, comparable to the loss of a human loved one.

Zika virus was first detected in Zika Forest in Uganda in 1947 in a rhesus monkey and again in 1948 in the mosquito Aedes africanus, which is the forest relative of Aedes aegypti. Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus can both spread Zika. Sexual transmission between people has also been reported.

Zika has a lot in common with dengue and chikungunya, another emergent virus. All three originated from West and central Africa and Southeast Asia, but have recently expanded their range to include much of the tropics and subtropics globally. And they are all spread by the same species of mosquitoes.

Until 2007, very few cases of Zika in humans were reported. Then an outbreak occurred on Yap Island of Micronesia, infecting approximately 75% of the population. Six years later, the virus appeared in French Polynesia, along with outbreaks of dengue and chikungunya viruses.

 There are primarily three ways to give birth: vaginal delivery, induced delivery and Cesarean section. Looking at the time of day when births occur using each method shows very different patterns (see graph here).

Vaginal births happen more or less evenly spaced out during the day, with a slight bump in the early morning hours. C-section births typically happen either around 8:00 am or noon. Induced deliveries typically happen around 3:00 pm.

Combining the National Labor Surveys IQ data with the hair color information from the same group of teenagers provides the ability to answer the question: are blondes actually dumb?
The surprising answer  at least given the prevalent stereotype  is that among white women, those reporting having blonde hair have the highest average IQ and the second-highest median, or midpoint, IQ. Plus both the mean and median are above 100, which is the value given to a person who has exactly average intelligence.

And before you mock the government for asking about hair color:
The NLS asks questions that, when taken out of context, may seem extremely strange. For instance, in one multiyear survey, the NLS repeatedly asks about a persons weight and height. Given that most people dont grow in height after their teenage years, asking respondents to state their height well into their late 20s is unusual.
Why does the government need to know this kind of information? Since the survey goes back to reinterview the same people over and over again, it is important to make sure the right person is interviewed. Many respondents are provided with a stipend to provide an incentive to answer the survey for the 10th or 20th time. To ensure the correct respondent participates, instead of a brother, sister or roommate, it is very helpful if the interviewer knows someones height, weight, eye or hair color.

Going up and down like a hookers panties     O'l Bill gave up more, and that was cause of someone elses mouth     Oh no! No you wont! You made your bed, and promtly shat in too! You ride this thing out and take notes !

The second you settle in somewhere else you will start whining about orange cheese like substanses, too little ice and the parhetic soda cups we offer in our fast food places, and why you have to pay for everybody else     Body of a classicaly trained pornstar     I guess ill throw my hat in this lottery aswell     Ofcourse, i don't know every legislation in the western countries.

But seriously, what can you do? The older generation does not have a valid reason for not accepting , its just because. 

Actually tell them that they are the ones making the choice , not you. Social stigma in the country and culture you no longer live in, or their daughter     Not EMT/ Or Paramedic. Worked as a security enforcer In the main trainstation of my country. 

In scandinavia its not unusual that the stations and trains are secured by private security, wich means that we are usualy the first responders on emergency situations and trained to deal with the most common first aid and ""triage"" estimations

Because its to do with trains so a lot of suicide by train = mince meat

Friend had to assist on moving the biggest pieces of the track cause the closest meat wagon was to far away (fire marshalls orders) ain nobody got time fo dat!

Me and my partner responded to a run over ( Person hit by train) when we arrived EMT/FDP alredy working on the situation so we isolate the area so they can work in peace. Lo and behold she's alive, just lost her leg, the last i heard before they got her in the ambulance "" make sure you have my bag!"" No screaming of pain or depresion of loosing the leg mind you

Second that haunts me most is not the worst ive seen but how i reacted to the whole thing

Im shift supervisor and i get a call that there is a drunk/junkie sleeping in a stairwell. I order ST-2 ( radio call) to check it out. I start to go to get lunch and he calls me on the radio and tells me the person is uncontient/non responding *just fucking perfect* ST-2 Do you need a Deffibrilator on the scene?
I...i..i think so, 
Turn back, grab the d-fibb and run to the sceene open the door and look down on the patient.. And i look back on my clearly shaken up guy, look down on the patient again "" are you serious?, what am i gonna do with this( shaking the d-fibb), I couldn't get this guy even lukewarm, nevermind save him! he looks confused at me

The ""patient"" had clearly been dead for days, face is retracted to a grin, gums are black, face is green, swolen black stomach and the syringe is still stuck in his arm. Cops determinded hes been dead for a weak. 

Im still disturbed that i found it amusing that my guy wanted the d-fib to try and save the corpse, and that i started to fuck with him when i saw that it was hopless

In fairnes we didnt have any suport system: 
See a dead body? Get punched? : nobody takes sick leave, if you do, you are not cut for this unit.

Nope didnt mean abortion is connected to sex ed, rather that it is covered and easily available     Mayby our outside views stem from docunentaries where they show teachers who cant show how to put on a condom, so they have to use a sock demostration on their feet

But in scandinavia our sex ed is taught in the 5/6th grade and again in 7th and 8th in more depth. They know we are gonna fuck so take care of it early

We are taught the reproductive system, pregnancy, birth control, condoms, disease.

Who cares if the president puts his feet on a desk when there are real problems going on?      Did you know they're also turning all the frogs gay???!      Either way, there are far more important things to worry about. Do you get this worked up about human sex trafficking or all of the homeless veterans with mental disorders in our country? Or what about the fact that there are still people in flint without clean water? 

Personally, I don't give a flying fuck about a desk or if someone puts their feet on it. It doesn't matter at all.      I doubt he gets so worked up over human sex trafficking or things that actually matter     Well, it wouldn't be 44 or 45 presidents since we got the desk in like 1880... .so theres that..

Everyone is entitled to their opinions- 

But how can people who've seen the first two seasons of this show honestly still love the show after what it has now become? Arrow used to be an amazing dark/gritty show about a vigilante with awesome action scenes and a plot that made sense. It wasn't perfect. But it was just so good. How can they think these new episodes are ""amazing"" or ""the best episode ever?"" 

I mean seriously. They fired one arrow... in a show called Arrow about a super hero named the Green Arrow and Team Arrow.... 

Felicity/Ollicity is hamfisted and shoehorned into so many scenes. She saved the day ""again, for the second time."" Is there anything she can't do? The Arrow is now ""Felicity and Friends"" 

The writing feels lazy and hard to follow. Now we have organic corhn and organic shipping ferhns. I still don't understand the main villain's motivations this season other than ""I am le evil, humanity needs a reset"". It just feels like it was all thrown together last minute. 

There was always some relationship drama but it wasn't the main focus. It was tolerable because the show had an engaging plot and awesome action scenes.  

If it had always been written this way, then maybe I would understand those types of comments but it was just sooo much",0

SI was established in 1960 by the 11th General Conference on Weights and Measures. With the only historical context to speak of until then being Avogadro and his contemporaries at the end of the previous century, a kilogram was defined as the mass of a cubic decimeter  of water. But the kilogram had to be *commissioned* by the GCWM where an arbitrarily sized hunk of  platinum-iridium was put under a glass cloche to match the mass of the liter of water and be oohed and aaahed at. They already      But I'm not proposing another change. Im simply trying to understand why a council of scientists, especially chemists and physicist that work with materials on a regular enough basis that it matters, didn't pick a standard mass unit in the first place that would scale the atomic mass unit by a rounder number than 6.02*10^23. It's a moot point, I know, but I'm sure there is a better and historically more interesting reason they came up with than convenience.      Originally, but the council that later redefined all those standards changed the definition of a meter to a specific fraction of the speed of light and the kelvin temperature scale that starts at absolute zero. They had the opportunity and didn't take it is all.   [Survey] What makes a coach good/bad?

I'm not entirely sold on SIMON's original motive though. Either way, they only traced Liam's steps through the last couple season to fill his timeline up to Grand Central. That wasn't all the plot holes. I think Systemics might be implicated. If not through the Hass family, then by their own accord.     Finale began with a flashback to before his first day at Quantico where he told Miranda he was being forced to take the blame for Chicago. 
The a montage of all the setup. 
They show Liam taking the plans from Simon. I'll re-watch the entire episode later.      No, in his confession to Alex and Ryan before they drop him, his original plan was to try to get Alex to drop out of Quantico. The plans came later. I'm not sure but I'm gonna go out on a limb and assume that when he bugged the Nat's rooms, that he found out about the Grand Central plans that Simon had right around the same time that he realized he wasn't going to be able to get Alex out the easy way. It still makes me hate how Liam's character was written because apparently Grand Central was plan B and that was a huge leap in planning without the equal leap in motivation. His beef with the FBI mismatches his obsession with Alex. All shoehorned into an episode and a half. Lets see what happens next season.      what are some of the hardware challenges of quick-sort?

I think it would be an awesome way to put into context just how many trends they are the exception to.      Thanks!  Bicycling as a form of transportation.  Here is my situation. I learned as a kid and haven't forgotten how to ride. But kids aren't often worried so much about fitness goals, maintaining a busy schedule, or protecting their 2-wheeled investment. So here I am, basically a noob, asking for some basic advice.      I know that if I want to write code, I need an IDE geared toward one particular language or family of, but for the execution of code that is written in Java or Python or CSS, are the compilers really that ubiquitous or what? I can't remember the last time I ran into a page on the web that couldn't show me something because I wasn't on a machine with flash player.     Is that a traveling expo? I am on the west coast.      If I'm not mistaken, traveling got to a peak 15% at 5-ish P.M. which blew morning rush hour our of the water. One of the coolest things I have seen in a while!     The Slavic and Cyrillic languages to name a few.       I don't think English has enough gendered words for that to be an issue but for someone whose first language doesn't contain articles, the idea of articles needs to be clearly and concisely communicated. For example; I [as posing as someone who is learning English] can tell that 'a' is to be used if the noun begins with a continent vs using 'an' if it begins with a vowel but when to use 'a(n)' vs 'the' is still confusing.      I was visiting family and friends that live in Germany and it was less of a tourist drawing conclusions from observation that seeing for myself what they (the people that live in Germany) had said. I guess some Germans just know better than other Germans... obviously.     all the examples that I'm coming up with in my head blurred the mouth too.  I like my doctor and my mechanic but I hope I don't have to see them.    ELI5: Why are articles (the, an, a, etc.) so difficult for ESL speakers to pick up on?  So, I understand that most languages have something quirky about them that native speakers just get and most others just don't but it's maddening to think that in a day and age where we understand so many things so much better than we used to, we can't quite articulate language itself.      Israel asked America out and that made everyone that Israels neighbors very angry, especially after how America and Syria have been looking at each other the last couple weeks. Taiwan also wants to ask America out but China is being the jealous friend. Brazil, usually the fun one, thinks prom is overrated and too expensive, especially since she is feeling under the weather, but the Prom committee reeaally wants Brazil to show up anyway. Russia is eying all of her exs. Ukraine was single. Everyone thinks Puerto Rico should be able to go but she isn't officially a student yet, admin is really dragging their feet with the paperwork. Costa Rica wore the prettiest dress. India brought 5 dates and is trying really hard to get rid of a couple. Saudi Arabia and his squad were the ones that showed up in a stretch hummer limo. The Korea twins make a point of showing up separately at different times with different dates in the same dresses.

Redundancy?   How do computers understand binary?

Swedish Cigar     I was about to say that it looked familiar.      This is the closest location to me. I'll try to come up with a group.      It was actually. But warranty or not, they should have fixed it. It took LG a while but I think they came out with a public statement about the bug (bootloop) for the models made before early October. They fixed it for free and paid for shipping both ways but I did loose some data.   Is there a way to recover messages after a factory reset?

When I was in Germany a few years ago, I saw a bunch of decommissioned windmills that were build for the tax breaks and abandoned for the lack of actual energy provided. I'm looking forward to see what is going to be different about this time.      It's great acting like athletes are the types of people that only care about how much money, publicity, and fun they can get in before they peak and then seeing stuff like this and realizing that some if not most are actually pretty damn good people.      Food porn.... just as fake as actual porn...      New York is also over-represented but most people don't care about anything outside of the 5 bureaus  of NYC and maybe Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, and Albany.... Lets go with over-estimating how much people know about the state because maybe my experience hasn't been a representative one but it is still fascinating.      Where do I go? How can I find this? Must do. Bucket list just got longer.   SuperCarlinBrothers do a good job of explaining just about everything Disney Pixar.       I purchased the phone I have now just weeks before the android 6.0 release date and it ended up being defective for hardware reasons so I sent it to the manufacturer (LG if you were curious) and got it back with MM.

Sure, so, it seems like everyone knows all the cities in California. Not just LA, San Diego, Sacramento and the Bay area, but all of it. I get that it is huge in a lot of respects (population, physically, economically, historically) but the only other places that people *seem* too have as good of a handle on is somewhere like Italy.   How do I KNOW if I am getting the best deal or not?  I always am [or at least think I am] on the lookout for money saving techniques, deals, sales, how to do the best research, etc. I'm not a penny-pincher but I am getting tired of friends and family telling me how much I could have saved on my latest big purchase if only I had come to them about if first.   How are people able to talk about California's geography as if it's all assumed knowledge?  I'm becoming familiar with it just by virtue of talking to Californians all the time but that doesn't seem like what everyone else is doing so I'm just curious.   John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt is a mental hospital patient singing about himself.       I've been thinking of trying a pizza recipe out! Thank you! What about the dough though?

I don't use apps i'm not confident in using.      Well now I am slightly more confused, the second part of your explanation where it is smaller than all positive numbers, larger than all negative numbers, and not zero...

I know about Chao and that is currently my favorite. I can't stand daiya but haven't melted it down on anything yet either so I guess that that's worth revisiting. Tofutti makes a good cream cheese but I;ll have to watch out for their ice cream. Did you know that Ben and Jerrys now has a couple dairy free flavors?!!   Is rubber really a good analog for human skin?  I've heard and seen that people who use a cutthroat razor have practiced with it on an inflated balloon first but I just can't understand how the skill is transferable. Great, you can not cut a balloon, but a face is different...right?!  Does anyone know of a good vegan cheese?  I developed an allergy so I have been dairy free for a while. It doesn't bother me anymore that I can't have a lot of things that I used to be able to but it is maddening that I have been able to find a good vegan version of yogurt, ice cream, milk, butter, and even some chocolates that don't taste too bitter. It's the cheese that no one can seem to come close to. Daiya just doesn't do it for me. Anyone else having any luck?        Football as in American football or as in what Americans call soccer?

Well, they say that every love story ever written is either R J or the taming of the shrew... I also don't think that they would introduce a new character as a plot convenience just so that Liz would have help pulling it off so I'm excited to see who it could have been. And for what it's worth, Aram is the one that quoted Shakespeare and if anything, it might be double-foreshadowing for what is to come of him and Navabi.      I park it in the garage, take hairpin turns nice and slow but long bendy roads quickly (and I've noticed more right turns than left) and about half the time, I break and accelerate smoothly and the other half, pretty hard. I also drive in reverse more often that I feel like is normal for things like reparking.   How do my driving habits affect my car's longevity?       I think the relationships between all the still-supposedly-alive characters will keep Tom alive at a minimum but we are starting to see the entire family tree. I'll give you that there are elements of family feud in the plot but family trees are at the epicenter of the plot so I guess only time will tell.   I've got a 2-part question about reposts.  1) What's the Reddit community's consensus on one OP posting the same thing to multiple subreddits for more eyeballs? I feel like if its applicable, go ahead but I could also see it being taboo for some reason. 

2) On the occasion that the moderators or the filter or whoever blocks a post recommends I take that post to a different sub, should I actually pursue it?     Romeo and Juliet's love were forbidden, yes, but not by a single power player in both of their lives [Reddington] while the rest supported their love. Besides, R J is a tragedy, and by Shakespearean standards, that means everybody dies at the end, not the lead character with an entire act left to go.   Hey people into fitness, how do you go about the REST of your day?  All of the working out I have ever done was either in PE at school or at home. I've never used the locker room showers but I always clean up after a workout if I can. Is that just something that I have to budget time for or is it a non-issue for you?      That's exactly it. Breaking characters out of battling other characters in their typecast would be great.      Well I could settle for that but the original thought was a dedicated season to pitting winners of previous battles against each other. Maybe one crowning champ per season?      Sooooo where is my giftcard? I went to the site, entered my credit card info, social, all of it.   Can we get a bracket going for the actual winners of the rap battles please?

  Is it alright for me to assume that links people post on Reddit are fine to go to?  Weather or not the NSFW filter is on, I can't help but be extremely weary of any website I've never heard of. I was hoping there was some security measures that Reddit implements.   What is something that is helping make your college experience?  No one is feeding me golden nuggets and I don't even know what to ask but I am looking for stuff like money tips, useful apps, and meeting people outside of class and my neighborhood.

Why does my link karma number show up by my username but not my comment karma number?       What country is that?      I think some companies have caught onto exactly that. I think Vegas has entirely outlawed high rises with windows that can open. And I forget what Japanese company it is that just resorted to installing nets under their windows.

Lol     Get a good heavy guage U-lock     I don't know. Banner and Stark had a bromance going in the first Avengers movie.

I know what dimensional analysis is, but that doesn't help me with a terminology/definitions understanding.      That being an ass about it is what I was originally thinking of, /u/TheAnhor ... I also live in a ESL household but I don't speak English with an accent. It's when people get pedantic that is frustrating.      Thanks for the heads up!      What /u/Drefen and /u/Ratagar said but also tell your friend that he could bring the lettuce from the store in for himself. Lol. I was allergic to the bread that Subway serves and so I went next door to a grocery store, bought my own baguette that I wasn't allergic to, and the subway employee made me a subway sandwich with the bread from next door. At that point, it's not the location breaking corporate policy, it's just excellent customer service.       Well my purpose was just recreational. What I ended up doing was creating a composite function where the parts can all be simplified down to constants but for the sake of mashing, I didn't simplify. So for example part of my function is shifted A(x) where A(x) = d/dx(third root (e))*mod(log_2(k),e^(sqrt2)), where k=3.8 ..... That simplifies down to zero.      Right. But it wasn't exactly full of horcruxes either. The fact that it was in the room of requirement was an added level of security but even in there, it's hiding in plain sight from those who are looking for something else.

He mentions that if I marry someone, I am sort of a pseudo family member who is equal to the spouse on the family tree only everyone on their tree gets the in law suffix from my perspective. My question is, then, what in the world do people on my family tree call the people on the spouse's family tree? What are my parents to their parents? What are my cousins to my spouse's cousins? What are my grandparent to their third cousins twice removed? Is there a name for that relationship that can shortcut through having t",0

A law firm won $50 million for Trump Entertainment but then had to sue its former client after Trump Entertainment tried to avoid paying its legal fees by claiming bankruptcy: In 2008, the law firm Levine Staller began filing tax appeals for the Trump Taj Mahal, Trump Plaza, and Trump Marina. Its work saved Trump's company lots of money: In 2012, Levine Staller won a settlement that returned $35 million in overpaid taxes and cut $15 million from the company's future liabilities, leading to a total savings of $50 million for the corporation. Trump agreed to pay $7.25 million to the law firm in legal fees, but then only paid Levine Staller $6 million before trying to claim the rest as unsecured debt in ongoing bankruptcy proceedings. In response, Levine Staller sued its former client, Trump Entertainment, and in 2014, a judge rejected Trump Entertainment's request to be absolved of this debt and told the company to pay up.

I feel like even from a point of view where the alpha and omega of morality are to preserve Republican control of congress, impeaching Trump would still be the best thing to do, unless you're never planning on having fair elections again.  Get rid of Trump, get Pence, pin everything on the bombastic outsider that everyone hates anyway, and act like you cleaned everything up yourself and we just need to move past it now.

I feel like that'd be awful optics, though.  Can you imagine Hillary's Justice Department bringing charges against her political opponent after the election?  Especially with Republican majorities in both houses of Congress?      What part don't you get?  The general joke is that Nintendo doesn't do much with Samus.     ""So, Obama was *competent*, eh?""     Pompeii voting for Vesuvius, because fuck Herculaneum.     Must be hard for him, never seeing any movies or buying computer products, since obviously he wouldn't be so hypocritical as to only do business with Democrats when he wants stuff, right?     What about how all those states that implemented gay marriage were going to descend into sin and chaos?     Not from a Jedi.     That look *suspiciously* like the ways of an incompetent, corrupt baboon.     Only downside is the *pet* is harder to get hold of afterwards.  Come back, Sparky!     My understanding is that Cinco de Mayo was chosen because Mexican Independence Day is too early in the school year, and college groups wanted to have a good day to celebrate Mexican heritage.  September 16 didn't give them enough planning time.       Don't you think historians would kill for this level of detail into the thoughts and beliefs of someone like Julius Caesar or Jesus Christ?     No one's saying arrest this guy or string him up and lynch him.  We're saying don't hire him at the State Department.  Is there no one equally qualified who hasn't likely sexually assaulted freshmen?     That's definitely a danger, but I figure, it's Steve King.  How much more conservatively can he vote without going full Freedom Caucus?

I mean, people used to enslave and lynch people for their skin color.  I think we're doing better.      Out of curiosity, do you support all people of any faith, including say, Islam, being able to do whatever they feel their faith tells them to do?       You mean like Florida Gun Supply, who in 2015 posted a sign declaring themselves a Muslim Free Zone, and are still in business to this day?     Call and say it isn't conservative enough and he should vote no for that reason?  A no's a no.  Doesn't matter why.     ^and ^on ^/r/rule34...

It's not like he doesn't have sections for little-known or unknown Spartans, too.  Maybe over time, all the cool stuff from Thermopylae just collected around Leonidas's memory.     Obviously, it all depends on how dictatorial things get before he's gone, but right now, with Trump's track record, I'm not entirely disappointed Clinton lost.  Had she won, Trump would be talking about illegal votes stealing the election, she'd have a Republican Congress that would never work with her and would refuse to confirm her SCOTUS pick, and all his voters would claim to be martyrs.

Fuck the remainers.     Thats....not a good sign  What happened to blues and bullets?  Despite rough edges i really enjoyed the first two episodes. And now...nothing. Havent heard a thing about any more coming. Does anyone know whats going on with it?     Nope, Ill be fine :)     I enjoyed ghosts of mars      John carpenter is directing GOAT     Troll?

And the eu is the rotting leg we are cutting off to save the rest. Quite an apt description     Fuck the EU     Its enough. You mean its not the decision you wanted, right? Just say that.

Never playing it again  Ok this is getting stupid now  No new info on not a hero. Im really itching to play more RE7. I will be so disappointed if its a short dlc . As much as i enjoyed banned footage, i hope this is a good few hours.

I heard that the outsourced company didnt do a job capcom was happy with. Does anyone have links about that?  Anyone reading the wwe comics?

Even if you arent really into comics, give them a try.  [no spoilers] mass effect andromeda really won me over  It was a really really rough opening few hours. The meaningless tasks felt too much like busy work, and the new crew didnt seem interesting. I hated the vaults too.

But i persevered. And though the opening hurt it overall, by the end i was excited for the future again. The loyalty missions and story from landing on harval onwards really caught my interest.

I dont know if the developers read this stuff. I know it was probably discouraging for them when intially it was kinda crapped on. But as people got more into it, it seems like me they ended up loving mass effect all over again.

I never would have thought during first few hours id be singing the games praises. But once i dropped the meanial tasks and focused on story and loyalty missions, the game really became more like classic mass effect and i truly hope we get more in the future.

Makes me sad we never got to finish the monsters with Dracula :(  Wwe 2k ps4 players. Wanna make a community?  Like we can add friends, organise tournaments, etc.

Would anyone here be interested? Would be nice to have a decent community of fellow wreddit ps4 players  [no spoilers]improvements for next game?  What would you like to see improved?

For me the key phrase is less is more. There were too many meaningless fetch quests that really slowed the game down untill i decided just to focus on main missions and loyalty. Some side missions were worth it but usually added some story to it, not simply ""place five hundred beacons"" or checklist quests.

My game go so much more enjoyable focusing more on the meaningful side quests as well as the main.

Of course some of the animation and human graphics could use work too.  Even if you never read comics  I just had to say even if you dont usually read comics, give the penny dreadful ones a try. IMO they really nail the show as well as they possibly can. Great writing and art. You can tell they put a lot of effort into it.  Best chant use ever  Rewatching the roman braun segment, i didnt notice untill today the ""you deserve it"" chant aimed at a battered roman on the stretcher. 

I completely cracked up. It was the best use of a chant ever, especially such a usually overused chant.

The sad thing is. Wwe are gonna squander strowman at the alter of roman lames.  Youd think anyone remotely creative would see the reaction and go with it, but wwe stubbornly pushes it down our throat anyway  [MEA Spoilers]After 11 hours, I finally started to love the game  It was a very very slow and rough opening few hours. I felt .and still feel there were too many useless fetch quests and menial tasks. But around Haral mission, and the start of the loyalty missions, i REALLY got into it.

It really felt from that point that it was like the old mass effect. The writing really got much stronger. I ended up loving the new crew. Some truly hilarious moments.

I felt the first few hours really tested my patience and i would have quit had i not been so invested in the series. Im glad i didnt because it really really blossomed into something great. The opening hurts it but it made a magnificent comeback  anyone notice the mass effect andromeda prometheus influences? Spoilers  I just finished it yesterday. After a slow, very slow and tedious opening few hours, i really got into and enjoyed the game a lot. 

I noticed too, a lot of the heavy influence of prometheus. Maybe its just me but i noticed similar themes. For example

A mysterious creator race who all seem to be wiped out that seeded the galaxy with life

The kett ship designs and armour seems very HR Gigerish

The exaltation process using genetic modification to mutate species like the black goo in prometheus

The kett take on genetics of species they exhault, much like xenomorphs take on the traits of their hosts.

Some of the landscapes are very similar to the planet in prometheus

Maybe its just me? But i thought overall it was really cool  [MEA Spoilers]Mass Effect andromeda prometheus influence? Mild Spoilers  I just finished it yesterday. After a slow, very slow and tedious opening few hours, i really got into and enjoyed the game a lot.

It was super cool for me to learn tom savini designed kalistos mania mask. And john carpenter is, or was , a huge wrestling fan so thats cool for me to know.

Id love a wrestling with wregret show on this  [No Spoilers] I hate the temple missions  In MEA. Do I have to do them to get outposts and missions? Really dont like them, so badly designed and dull.  I HATE the temple missions  [removed]  Congrats idiots, you all caused world war 3  [removed]  Game sequels youd love to see but probably wont.  Theres a lot of games id love sequels for that alas sadly wont ever happen.

What are some of yours? Here are my dream sequels.

A true sequel to the 2009 ghostbusters game.

Ghosthunter 2. The first is underrated, sony cambridges best imo. It still makes me sad how such a cool, creepy game was barely played and remembered.

Darkwatch 2. It was in the works and got cancelled which was a real shame.

The darkness 3 i loved the first two.

Clive barkers jericho.  Cool gameplay, great story and character design. And ugh that ending. Id kill for a sequel. Mercury steam have only improved over the years since too.

Wwe all stars 2. I loved the first, a refreshing arcade style take on too serious wrestling games.  They should make ORC backwards compatible  Im really itching to play it again  Where is all the hype for get even?  It seems like an interesting game doomed to faliure because its not easy to describe.

Trailer

https://youtu.be/boGPCX3TVys  Finally got hold of those mattel retro wwe figures!  Got brock, cena and warrior and waiting on taker to arrive.

Love these figures, as someone who grew  up with the hasbro figures.  Tom savini created an awesome mask for mania    Minecraft John Ceeeena!    Rule fucking 3 is retarded  [removed]  The Darkness and its sequel deserve way more love  [removed]  So is scorpio getting exclusives?  [removed]  Im really struggling with Mass Effect Andromeda  Not difficulty or anything, just trying to finish it. It just feels so uneventful. The big open maps really dont suit it, too many meaningless side quests and just doesnt seem to be any real plot. I wanna finish it just because its mass effect but damn its been disappointing  Wait for No more Heroes is killing me  God I love RE7. I cant wait for the dlc  I felt kinda bad for dracula  I know he was the bad guy so to speak. But i really do think he loved vanessa and accept her fully. He didnt need her to be anything other than what she was. He truly loved her. And when she died, he probably could have finished off the others as he was handling them easily, but it seemed to break his heart.

I dont know, does anyone else get the feeling he truly loved vanessa?  At Mania, Mizryse won  Sure they lost the match. But miz looked strong and actually was quite dominant,  and super over. And cenas proposal was exactly what miz said all along. A show for the cameras.

And then the smackdown send off lol.

Miz is one of the crowning jewels of wwe. Too bad the nincompoops in charge have too big a hard on for roman lames to notice.  The comic is excellent too  I will also say the comic is quite brilliant too. I just read the first trade and it really feels part of the canon and crosses over very nicely to the show.

Im really excited to see how the comic continues the show  How was Nathans Dad a bad guy?  I love the show! And even though season three felt understandably rushed to a conclusion (i dont buy they knew it was ending then), this still bugs me.

Ethan dad wasnt a good guy. That was clear. But i at least understood why he went to the lengths he did. What ethan allowed to happen to his mother and sister was evil. That really was hard for me to reconcile with me liking him as a character... his dad may deserve what he got but his sister and mother and brother didnt.

This kinda made me actually cheer for drac a bit to be honest. He was at least honest.  Is anyone playing This is the Police?  [removed]  Im glad I am no longer a lapsed fan  Wwe was my passion as a kid. I loved it so much. Im 33 now. And around 2002 my interest died. Not that i stopped following, but i def didnt keep up as much as i should and i could miss a month or few months without caring at all.  i was a big benoit fan and that also hurt to see what happened to his poor family. I was not done but not really interested beyond i guess nostalgia of the good times.

I was also tired of bitching about wwe and disliking the product. Nothing was changing, they werent listening, so i decided to just stop watching instead of keep complaining. Its the same thing im doing now with walking dead.. its ok to have negative opinoons but when it was all i was seeing l figured its just not for me.

then i got back into it. Im still not where i used to be. I probably wont ever be. But i at least feel the love for it again. And though theres still crap creative on raw and typical ego based decisions. I found stuff to love.

I CRedit this to a few factors.

nxt. As someone who bashed hhh and still feel his ego ruined many a career and feud, he nailed this and made up for it almost. Though the booker t and rvd squashings wont ever be forgotten by me. 


Rusev , Daniel Bryan, CM Punk and the Miz are some of the performers who remind me of wrestling at its best great characters and workers

I guess im trying to say im glad i feel love for it again.

The southpaw thing imo is wrestling at its very best. Passionate performers being themselves. Ironically without wrestling, it was steepd in the history and unique traits of wrestling to be infinitely watchable.

The miz has been on fire for months. His promos are some of the best out there.

And the newer divas like charlotte and becky helped, as well as other nxt talents like finn.

So glad to be here rambling with yall!  The episode with yuri and citizen z is so underrated  I know not everyone likes z but i always found him likable. The episode with yuri (""what is wrong with dog"") is honestly such an underrated episode. The sense something is off and not right is powerful and the twist executed excellently.  Athletic women with muscle: would you ever date a fat dude? If not/so, why?    Athletic women with muscle: would you ever date a fat dude?  [removed]  Is arizona sunshine still coming?  Not heard anything about it in a while for psvr  I love this game but have zero idea about the story   I wish there were a full campaign or remastered original KF for ps4 because i dont get it.

Are the zeds flesh eaters? Is it a virus? Can people turn? How are there infinite clones?

So many cool things i love but its not even touched even in audio diaries or something  How are miz and maryse the heels again?  Seriously. Not only are they hilarious, we know cena and nikki have sabotaged careers. Alex riley for one.  And miz has a point, inthe gm is related to these two so there goes impartiality. If this were a regular show, surely the people telling the truth who havent hurt others would be the heroes?

Yet its obviously gonna lead to a loss. And cena will propose. Which ironically is exactly the point miz made in the parody, where the cameras have to be on.

Miz is a true gem and should get more respect.   Problems unlocking trophies  Ok so on ps4 ive twice gathered all collectibles on nuked, no joy.

Anyone else having issues?  Was this game a sales success?  I hope so, it was genuinely one of my favourite games this gen and the following improved and expanded it  I admit i only like the lords of shadow trilogy  Not saying the originals are bad. I always loved the concept, but i wanted a big sweeping gothic epic story and never felt anything delivered untill the lords of shadow trilogy, which are some of my favourite games.

People say it didnt feel like old cvs. I cant say because ive barely played them. But i loved it.

I am a huge horror and dracula fan so it was nice to get three titles in the series.

Any other fans of this sub series of cv?  I prefer fear to walking dead  Im a huge zombie fan. I found that walking dead has become stale. Recycled plot, and just the zombies are not a threat and basically soap opera window dressing. I just barely can be bothered to watch any more.

Fear is flawed. But i like that the zombies are still a threat. I also like the different settings and scenarios. The mexico setting was quite special. 

I only wish this series had been more focused on mankinds fall, instead of rushing it completely. And into delving into the zombie virus and epidemic itself. I know they didnt want to , but at this point, i think they should. Because no one has ever showed much interest in it or even been that startled that hey the dead are coming to life. And i find that a bit jarring. I sure as hell would wanna know whats up.  My experience in 2012 with a medium  Posted this in paranormal too


Ive had a few, most not convincing at all.

In 2011 my beloved mother died. We were very close. I was devestated. But ive always been undecided on god, afterlife, etc. I never dismissed the ideas but cant say i ever believed. 

There have been a few mediums ive seen. Most were meh,
But one was able to tell me a lot of different things, including my brothers job, my mothers initials, and medical problems a friend of mine was going thru, all without me saying a word. She insisted i didnt say much untill she told me so as not to influence her. I still to this day cant figure out how she did it, and im very aware of cold reading techniques.

What surprised me is she was in an unassuming little stall in a shopping center. There was no big hurrah about her. And she had hundreds of letters, all i different handwriting, pinned to her wall of people she helped. 

Anyone have any convincing encounters?  Anyone had any good encounters with mediums?  Ive had a few, most not convincing at all.

Anyone have any convincing encounters?  Does anyone else collect wrestling figures?  Yep im a nerd.

I used to have all the wwe hasbro figures as a kid. Collected jakks till around 2002 when my passion for wrestling waned. I always followed it, but for a few years my interest was minimal

Few years ago i picked up some mattel figures and was pretty impressed. I dont buy many , especially as its hard to get newer releases in my area. But still go out of my way for certain figures such as bret The GOAT hart.

It especially gave me a kick to see they recently made a hasbro homage retro series which i hope will come to uk.  Huge zombie and z nation fan!  Imo its far more entertaining than walking dead. That show is a soap opera and zombies are basically window dressing. Z nation does so many cool things with the genre.

Im really happy to see other people who love the show. I wish there were more merchandise like figures.

Also murphy is amazing! Im glad they didnt make him a bad guy  Whatever happened to the overkill walking dead game?  [removed]  Ok i just saw a gameplay designer for Bioware racist tweets  [removed]  I know this is a stupid question but does science completely dismiss an idea of the afterlife?  [removed]  Whats this south paw wrassling thing about?  Can someone fill me in ? And not in the paige way


Ive heard about it but dont really know much about it.  I am not as in the loop as i used to be with wrestling though im still a fan.  Brad and xavier = best tag team ever  [removed]  Games on paper you should have loved...but didnt  Which games are out there that you personally felt you should have loved, but didnt? Not even outright hated. Maybe just felt like you should like them more than you do. Elements on paper that took your fancy and seemed up your street but for some reason didnt fully grab you.


Mine.

Bloodborne. I love the asthetics. i love the horror. I love the concept of hunting monsters. But ....i didnt love the game. I am not someone who seeks hard games out. I prefer a good story and fun time. And as much as i appreciated elements of the game, it didnt win me over. I dont have he patience for it which is a shame as its well made for what it tries to do. Apply this to the dark souls series too.

Dishonored games. Solid games. Finished both. But yet...both have things i love. The world, the graphics. The design are all gorgeous. I love the whole rat plague setting. The intrigue, the supernatural. But i felt the game, as someone who played agressively, tried to force a stealth tone. It wasnt really as much of a choice as they made out. I mean you could be agressive but felt like you were being punished for it, especially with the high chaos bad endings.

Both how to survives, im a huge zombie nut. I like mild survival mechanics. But i found both games very mediocre. It takes a lot for me to not bother finishing a game but i couldnt finish the sequel. The first was frustraiting for random difficulty curve.

these are all games that on paper were perfect for me. So i feel a bit sad they didnt work out that way for me.

You guys?  Can someone explain Umbrella Corps and the mangas new lore?  I played the game and hated it so didnt bother finishing campaign. I cant bring myself to play it again.

I also am not a fan of manga. I tried to read it but reading backwards irks me. Can someone explain heavenly island and masahawa desire to me and how they are linked into canon?  Am i the only one that loved the followings endings?  I see them get hated on a lot. I especially like the ""bad"" ending because it opens up story possibilities and is also in keeping with the zombie film traditions its inspired by.  Is this coming to consoles?  As a console only gamer this looks awesome. You got yourself a buy if it ever gets ported  i love Sir Patrick and Ginger  Thank you for this sub, Im a huge fan of Sir Patrick and have always been. And seeing his love for Ginger has been heartwarming. I suffer major depression but every time I see these updates it warms my heart  Why didnt we get a sequel to clive barkers jericho?  Theres many games i felt deserved sequels. But only a few still to this day bother me.

One of those is clive Barkers jericho.

Im a horror fanatic. Ironically though never been a huge barker fan. But i loved this game. I thought it had refreshing mechanics for a shooter. Such as telekenetic sniper. 

The story (apart from a super lame ending) was really cool. Really nice alternate hellish versions of history as levels. ANd i really liked the characters. Two dying at the end surprised the hell out of me.

I really thought there was huge potential for a series.

Mercury steam also went on to do the castlevania lords of shadow games which i love. But ill always have a soft spot for jericho too  Lets talk Enslaved  [removed]  Horizon reminds me of underrated gem Enslaved Oddessy to the West  [removed]  Your thoughts on audio diaries and collectibles?  A lot can be pointless, like the feathers and flags in assassins creed.

But some can add real value to world building and telling stories in a universe.

Horizon Zero Dawns is a recent great example. They were all thematically linked to the worlds history. The view points especially i found very moving as one mans personal story as the world crumbled.

Ive always dug Resident Evils files too, especially itch tasty.  And dead island was another game i felt did it well with postcards, audio files, diaries. Etc.

Whats your general attitude? Do you collect them? What are some of your favourites?  Is Killing Floor 2 getting further DLC?  I loved this game. But i notice its not had any dlc at all. Is it going to get any more?

It reminds me of left 4 dead. I would have loved a full campaign, it seems like they have a lot of lore for it but nowhere in the actual campaign.  Killing floor 2  [removed]  Your favourite xbox original games?  I loved Buffy The Vampire Slayer. I was a huge fan and actually brought my xbox for that game. The collective were a damn fine developer. Shame they never finished the Harker game they were working on. The sequel was fine too .

There were plenty of others. Call of cthulhu has one of the most tense sections in games ive ever played.

  Anyone remember ps2 game Ghosthunter?  [removed]  Forgotten games: Clive Barkers Jericho  [removed]  Am i the only one who HATES the souls style games?  Its a shame to me because i LOVE the asthetics. I love the monster designs.

I have tried all threee dark souls and bloodborne. I really wanted to like them especially as im a huge fan of horror.  But i found them so frustraiting. I just dont find it fun to die over and over and loss any progress i make.

I honestly dont see why they couldnt add an easy mode. People would still get the hard mode they love, but a mode with modified damage and hp for monsters for people who just want to enjoy the lore and world.

Its a shame to me because these are games i SHOULD love  The stamina system needs work  [removed]  There are genuinely great movie games  First post here!

I know movie games get a bad wrap and mostly rightfully so.

But there are some great ones.  Someone brought up the warriors and king kong, both really good games.

X men origins wolverine unleashed was brilliant too. Better than the movie its based on and a truly true to character game.

I actually thought the Van helsing game was pretty damn solid, and the constantine game.


Theres a lot of movie games i really enjoyed. Your thoughts?  You guys ever play the 2009 wolverine game?  It was awesome. R rated as hell. I cant help but think a sequel based on the comic old man logan would be great.  Ironically enough years before the DOFP movie, it had scenes set in days of future past universe.

Great boss battles too. Even a few references to Hulk with the WENDIGO gamma radiated enemies   Lets talk 10-8 rounds  [removed]  Bisping and Bravo get into heated argument    Dana to Woodley ""you aren't a money fight, shut up and fight""    Hero Bisping trash talks GSP    Are we allowed to buy sell trade in this forum?  Im a huge collector but that old collector problem has come up. Space. I have to get rid of a lot of old stuff and have no real idea how to do it.   Are we allowed to in this forum?  What we become, a danish zombie movie  Hi guys! Long time lurker. Im a huge horror fan and wanted to contribute.

I love monsters and zombies in particular. This is a really good movie. Its a slow burn but the creeping dread in the background of the story of a situation spiralling out of control really adds to the horror. And the zombies are actually a threat.

I really reccomend giivng it a watch  I loved the Order 1886 and would love a sequel  I know i might get downvoted but i did. I know it was too short, and sadly there was a lack of content but i loved what was there. There just wasnt enough of it. It felt like it ended a third of the way into a deeper story.
Loved the world and concept. Much like penny dreadful a favourite show of mine.
I really would love a sequel  i loved the order 1886  [removed]  State of Decay is the most underrated exclusive ever IMO  I love that game.  Im both a horror and zombie fanatic and that game and the expansions for me were close to a perfect experience for a zombie apocalypse. A narrative with more depth is all i could ask for more.

I feel it gets unfairly forgotten or dismissed when talks of exclusives come up. To me its worth its weight in gold and despite the rough edges the experience of it is proof of gameplay and design overcoming technical shortcomings  A guy asking for a female opinion  [removed]  Anyone else dying for Castlevania Lords of Shadow trilogy on BC?  I never cared about the old CVS to be honest. I found them too dated and wasted a really cool concept . But the lords of shadow reboot blew me away and is in my book a classic. Id love  to be able to replay the trilogy on my xbone. Anyone else?  Any ideas about the virus? Potential [spoiler]  Is there anything known about the harran virus or its origins?

Closest we get is, as far as i remember, in the following. At the dam we see the mother and her group in a flashback ingesting the chemicals that slowly turn you into a sentient volatile. Is it possible the dam was the outbreak starting point?  Was it a viral weapon?

Thoughts?  Cant beat EMD or Main House 2 on jacks 55th  [removed]  GSP is a coward  [removed]  hello fellow MMA fans! New here, long time lurker  [removed]  This sub loves GSP too much. Conor was right about him being fake  [removed]      Shit opinions     Its an absoloute joke people think this movie is any good     Im glad to see some people can still tell a shit movie     Lol comparing shaw to newt and hicks     Thats what I mean, the whole thing is poorly fucking written. Alien,Aliens alien 3, even resurrection, all had plausible reasons for where they take place and why, not simply ignoring all logic for no real reason. He shouldnt be that stupid, as a captain.      Resurrection shits on this movie. And its not because resurrection is great.     Its a disconnect because ridley doesnt give a shit     Are you stupid?  He CLEARLY didnt trust david. He fucking wanted to kill him. How is that trust in any way shape or form? Would you suddenly let someone you wanted dead say ""hey lookit this its kewl i swear""? If so you would be a moron     Resurrection shit on it     How many alien movies did someone put their head near an egg because someone they tried to kill for being shady told them to? Remind me  of that. Its not the act, its why he did it and how. David could have koed him and forced him into the egg, that makes way more sense than trusting a guy your gut tells you is shady. And if youd look because a guy you dont trust tells you too, that makes you one of the dumbest human beings alive


And its a plot hole because its fucking stupid and doesnt make sense,      I really think season 4 got a bad rap. They worked it as best they could and i still appreciate how it all weaved together     IMO the only canon movies are alien four movies and avp movies.

Im totally ignoring these in my own in head canon     David is jar jar     I dont understand why people like these prometheus characters     But that still doesnt explain it. I mean fifield was nothing like it     Huh? Bishop says hi     They were both crap tbh     It should have been a different script     Yeah this should be fuckingg common sense to be honest

If someone you dont trust asks you to stick your head into something weird, who the fuck would be stupid enough to do that???

Its like people who accept this stuff have no common sense. Nobody would realistically do that. It would be different if david was his friend or earned his trust but the guy nearly killed david and thought he was shady     Is this gonna be on region one blu ray?     Its kind of a joke you can get arrested for comments.     Blood     Lol dude im super glad we are leaving the eu. I voted out and am so happy and glad the country might finally go back in the right direction.     Good job!     Ah thank you     Thank god someone else wants those. I actually brought the original xbox for the first buffy     Whens it out?     It is indeed     Its common sense dude. A person you know or strongly suspect to be shady asks you to put your face in a thing you dont know what the hell it is. Would you do it?

Like really, now. If you knew someone who was dodgy and they asked you ""hey  put your head in this weird thing i made""  would you really?     i think its hilarious how triggered you are lol :) im happy we are out of the eu shitshow     Wanna explain how the EU has that shitty human rights list that makes criminals more important than victims?     If it fucks the eu then its good for me     I dont need to get upset. Lions dont worry about sheep     Farage should pocket money from the frauds.

subject2101,"    Of course the only correct answer to this is the Civilization Series, silly :-)     I didn't like any of season 1 of Parks and Rec, but it went on to be one of my favourite shows  I made a bigger version (2560x1440)       TBH, I don't think I struggled with a particular concept.

That was until i plugged it into my Focusrite sound card (plugged both left and right sound channels into the card.

WTF only left works so i take out the left and plug it into the (soundcard right channel) ...Nothing, Ok get headphones to check right channel still nothing.

Here is what i think i may have done wrong.
1 i unplugged the right channel XLR and plugged it back in  (loose connection)
2 I hit the 48v button on the sound card.

I returned the miniKORG got a new one ...now i am afraid to plug it into my sound card.

Did i do something wrong?   My microKORG and Poly 61 (Question)  OK i just picked up the micoKORG yesterday here is my question.

      Until the republicans lose the house impeachment is a fantasy

Indeed true,sadly true..To think the republicans can sit idly by and watch this clown ruin our country is more than deplorable. It's criminal.

This has all the earmarks of a dictatorship...ALL OF THEM..and disparagingly so few republicans have the nutsack to do anything about it.



     Yea not bad,dude has substance.     He accomplished his dream, time now to turn the page.

If he enjoys singing on the streets so be it,however, if he doesn't then it's on him too find something else.

I enjoy making music...but i'm not going to quite my day job....this guy can get a job and make music at home just like millions of other talented musicians.

If he thinks he is going to reemerge as a 50 something pop star this dude is grasping at straws.

Best of luck to him.        Korgoth

From what I heard Korgoth of Barbaria was just too expensive to produce, Because It was so brilliantly animated, the cost of each episode was too high so the network dropped the show. 

Sad because i think it could have taken off.

I'm in CT 

Thanks in advance :  )      I will write something up soon for the sub to get you started.     He is in CT, he wants to go dig the Yonkers dump if your up for it perhaps i can bring you....i have many dumps in New York.      Aquachigger seems like a nice guy and he is a dog lover, i'd definitely like to dig with him.  Recently went digging with this guy,he has an excellent website and is a great resource for information.       Honestly I haven't met a digger yet that uses them.

Probes are useful,however, i usually dig the entire site anyway so i have no use for them.

So true the guy is basically a big kid, he has a good spirit and in no way does he promote violence.

Dude embodies happiness and a genuine love for his hobby, how anyone can make him out to be (even remotely) someone who supports violence needs there head checked.

I can't think of a more jolly guy on YouTube.    Repealing Obamacare was why she voted for Trump. Now shes bitterly disappointed.        many Republicans are seeing the ugly side of the GOP shining under the spotlight.

I think you did a great job, I did something similar when i was your age, my mom bought me this broken organ at a tag sale and i took the output wires from the speakers and spliced them onto a ""learn to connect circuit  board"" as seen here ---http://s395.photobucket.com/user/SeeMikesPics/media/200_1_Electronic04.jpg.html


You might adopt a similar method as it worked well for me.

Anyway just trying to give you ideas.  What the presidents spending plans reveal       I feel like this could have been so much better, the black guy had very few if any good arguments.

My dogs give me strength when i find it hard to have any, They always love me and I refuse to let them down.

Basically they get me out of the house (exercise) and give me strength when it's hard to find.

Adopt a lost soul at your local shelter     Personally I don't like the sounds from VST's for my main synth lines, to me they lack depth and a special something.

My suggestion to OP is to get an analog keyboard and learn how to make sounds, If you love those detuned BoC synth sounds then learn about LFO wave changes.

I'm sad because the point of my sub was to be an avenue so people could find new artists they haven't heard before, finding this out really pisses me off.....

Not only is he not paying them but taking credit? that's fucked!

 Eyesix records suddenly started following me a few days ago then stopped a day later ....now i wonder if this guy stole from me?..if he did dude is surely scraping the bottom of the barrel lol. 




     Nice cut, I have never seen anybody actually execute such a cut, very cool.   This time the ladder was on the ground       Great track guys, I love that slow LFO.
     It's good for bass lines.  Redpoint - Hoechst Skyline       Kinda a weird response       Now that I have gone back and listened to Tycho's dive album that came out the previous year in 2012 and Volscp in 2013 there is a striking similarly in the sound of the bass from Volscp and Dive.

They share the same basic structure and tone, I'd put my money on this being tycho's creation.

Dive - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6ih1aKeETk t

Fun fact: The youtube handle (three15two) that uploaded Volscp when matched with the corresponding letter to the alphabet spells out Cob obviously Boc backwards.

I wonder if there is some sort of riddle here?

     From what I have read this tracks creation points to Tycho.

Rumor has it that it's purpose was a promotion for Tycho's Awake album that followed shortly after the release of this track.

Nobody has officially claimed this track, It could be just somebody having fun with the BoC vibe, Me personally, i'd say Tycho, the use of a real bass sample. that may provide a clue as Tycho is an accomplished bass player.

More about the man:

Land records and city directories paint an incomplete picture of W.E. Henebreys life in Danbury. But we know this much: at his height W. E. had land and money but by the early 1920s William and his wife, Annie, couldnt pay a 93 dollar debit and a lien was brought against their house. Though incomplete, we know this much about W. E.s life: W. E. kept saloons at 13 White St in 1885 and 21 White St in 1888. In 1890 he ran saloons at 290 and 292 Main St. In addition to moving businesses often in those early days, W. E.s home addresses varied. From 1885 to 1901 William Henebry moved at least five times. However, by 1902 William had set down roots. He leased a saloon at 194 Main St (the business was open at that address for years) and bought a house on McDermott St in Danbury. Business was good at the turn of the century for W. E. He owned several properties in Danbury at least two on White St. One property, number 19 White St, he leased to the Foley Bros, William and John, two well know Danbury bottlers. In 1912 a fire broke out in the Foley Bros saloon and W. E.s property was severely damaged luckily he was insured. However by 1917 the tide had turned against William Henebry and one of his White St properties was foreclosed on. Then in 1918 came the onset of prohibition. By 1920 the country was dry. It appears Henebry and others tried to make a go of business turning their saloons into juice bars but by 1920 they had all gone out of business. Times must have been tough for Henebry. As was stated earlier an injunction was brought against W. E. Henebry. James S. Higgins of Columbia Market Inc an insurance and real estate firm won a court case against William for 93 dollars William couldnt pay and a lien was put on his McDermott St property. In 1924 the paper trail ends. It appears William and Annie simple disappeared. All thats left of W. E. Henebrys existence in Danbury are the bottles we find 100 plus years later. Pictured: three William E. Henebry whiskey flasks ca 1900.

I think i'm the only one with a Henebry that is embossed in script and that looks more like a medicine than a whiskey flask.
Perhaps Mr. Henebry was doing more than whiskey?     The bottles embossing reads W.E Henebry Danbury, Conn

That slot is for a pin board that acts like a musical generator and it's fully customizable just by changing the resistor placement or just run your fingers on the back of the circuit board to make new connections ......it's a crazy far out idea and i love it.

During cutscenes, my player waddles like a duck with her feet spread wide apart, has awkward posture while standing, and never seems to do any natural movements while in conversation. This is contrary to the NPCs that look fine and move fine during cutscenes, as well as gameplay where the player's walking and standing animations look great. Anyone else notice this?

Oh, this is on a female mage, if it matters. I haven't tested on a male character yet.

EDIT - I mean, just look at [this](http://i.imgur.com/QvpLM7Z.png) standing pose. It's just wtf.  Everybody get up, it's time to slam now.    This game was MADNESS. Fucking knife guy! I love this game    4th Prestige in, I have decided this is the best submachine gun class there is. Holy crap.  Disclaimer: this requires a professional gun variant of the ASM-1.

Alright guys, this shit is redonk. It's seriously good (at least for my playstyle). I've almost exclusively used SMGs for my time in AW and I have a few hundred kills with most of them. A couple thousand with the MP11.

http://imgur.com/a/tI7db#0

The mother fuckin ASM-1 Rigor. +2 Accuracy, for -2 Handling. Accuracy reduces recoil of aimed fire and handling only affects your hip fire. That's fine, I rarely shoot from the hip with this thing.

[See here for more attribute information.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCUdAjFpk1g list=UUk8cNb10L5rmV9xB13ADCWA)

Attachments: Foregrip + Rapid Fire + Stock.

This thing has minimal recoil. Normally, you throw rapid fire on an SMG to make it a hip fire monster as the ADS recoil is significant. NOT THIS THING. Even without the foregrip it's still a manageable amount of recoil. With it though, this gun is a laser beam of rapid fire from the highest damage SMG in it's class.The +2 accuracy from the Rigor variant really shows off here. I thought about throwing a laser sight on here, but nah. The stock provides the gun the mobility that a laser sight would offer, but also building off the gun's natural strengths. The hip fire is still decent, it does have rapid fire so you'll at least be able to spam bullets if you need to before you can get a good ADS. Oh and, in case you didn't realize, do you know what happens when you have fast fire rate and minimal recoil? You now also have a long range weapon.

As far as perks go, these seem pretty standard/self explanatory. You could probably swap Low Profile for Overcharge if you wanted. I may do that. For the Exo Ability, I use Overclock for Kill Confirmed and I use Ping for Hardpoint or other objective based game modes.

The playstyle of this gun is very much SMG with the added bonus of this thing being able to act like an assualt rifle at longer ranges. The first few bullets of a burst fire faster, so if you have multiple targets to shoot at, I start a burst for each of them if I can (assuming you killed the first guy).

I'm going to upload some footage tonight of me playing with this and I'll post it if there seems to be interest.   Kill Confirmed is now to 85 tags.  It now takes 85 collected tags to win. Just noticed this. Awesome change, imo.  Guys, the Bal-27 is more balanced than you may realize.  Just think, while your opponent is reloading his Bal, you'll be able out dps him!

Almost makes up for all the games I don't get wild growth. *Almost*.  My Wolf's Head Medallion came in today! (Shoddy phone pics incoming.)    What happened to the mage(s) that created witchers in Geralt's early life?  So, we know that the witchers of Kaer Morhen guard the mutagens and potions required to mutate people into witchers. We also know that the witchers of Kaer Morhen do not possess the knowledge or magical capabilities required to use these mutagens. Many years before Geralt's time, Kaer Morhen was attacked by an anti non-human mob and Vesemir was the one of the only survivors. So, we know there were mages around after this assault to create more witchers. Best guesses to Vesemir's age are 300+ years old. I've seen Geralt's age guessed to about 106 at the time of The Witcher 2. I can't know for sure, but I'm going to assume that the other witchers of Kaer Morhen are about the same age as Geralt (give or take a few decades). So, it seems that 100 years before the end of the series, the mage(s) that created Geralt and Eskel and Coen and all the current witchers must have fled or been killed. They couldn't have been killed in the assault on Kaer Morhen because witchers have been created after that. I've read through the books series twice now (fan translations) and I cannot recall Sapkowski ever saying anything about what happened to the mages that would have been around for Geralt's transformation. Does anyone know?  Who is that guy standing in the back?    Titanfall is so fun.    With the shotgun, you can really use all the mobility you have in Titanfall to your advantage both offensively and defensively. I present to you an EVA-8 Montage: ""This is My Weapon"".

Facebook probably will let Oculus ""operate independently on our own vision""...  Facebook will probably step to the side, providing resources and funds into letting Oculus build the best VR headset their little hearts can make. Maybe a ""suggestion"" for a feature here, a ""suggestion"" there, but ultimately the R D will be all about Facebook providing the means of Oculus building the best CV1 that they (and we) could possibly imagine!



But then, when it's done, Zuckerberger will snatch it out of their hands, slap FB's logo on the front and do whatever he god damn well pleases with it. I think Luckey has been bullshitted by a multi-billion dollar company with speeches of independence and the promise of him being the top of VR that maybe it made him forget who he was dealing with. Maybe FB took advantage of the man's vision and determination to put out an excellent product. Maybe Luckey just doesn't give a fuck beyond having the ability to build a VR headset. Who knows?

I think Palmer Luckey has been bullshitted in a big way. Maybe he had the best intentions with this deal, but it's probably hard to see clearly with $2b waved in front of your eyes. The thought that being acquired by such a scummy company would (by itself) cause a lot of indie devs to back out of Oculus development probably never even crossed his mind.

Oh well. Like Notch said, this will likely make more competition in VR. More competition is always a good thing for accelerating innovation and bringing consumers the best products at the best prices. Will the next big gaming VR headset be the Oculus? I doubt it. But I'm sure someone will come to our rescue.

Gaben save us.  I don't see enough people wallhanging. It's a great way to have a vantage point over a room or objective! People don't look up I'm the walls for pilots.... yet.    I can't hear enemy footsteps at all.  Which is odd to me as there is a perk to silence your footsteps (among other things). There have been numerous times I've watched the kill cam and seen an enemy chasing right behind, miss a kick, keep running to me and then land a kick or finally shoot me. And yet, as a headphone user, I heard absolutely nothing. Anyone else have this ""issue""?  Nvidia Shadowplay, anyone have it working?  It worked during the BETA, now it won't show up.

No patch notes yet but MAA dodge now takes 25 stam, so 4 dodges instead of 6 before you run out. Bubble is still the same, as far as I can tell. Didn't test anything else. I'll edit this post when they put out patch notes.

EDIT - [Here you go, mah good friends.](http://forums.tornbanner.com/showthread.php/18709-BETA-Chivalry-Medieval-Warfare-Patch-21)

EDIT 2 - Apparently there will be a part 2 to this beta patch coming out soon. Check the OP in the link.  My only goal in life is to make dead as many archers as I can.    I want a MOBA style base capture game mode for Titanfall.  Given that Titans can get some decent diversity in fighting styles/weapons, I think Titanfall could have a ~~good~~ fucking brilliant competitive scene. I mean, am I crazy or are they setting up a MOBA style shooter anyway? We have minions already in the game, monsters we know will be in the game, turrets we know will be in the game. And, afaik, one of the devs in Respawn worked for RIOT. I think they would be insane to not at least try and pull off a MOBA style base capture type gamemode. If it were even remotely balanced, this game could spawn a competitive community like no other and, if it did, I would probably never stop playing this game. It'd be everything you could want in a competitive shooter and it'd REALLY set it apart from games like CoD and BF.

In case you're unclear with what MOBA style would mean, there are minions that would fight and push forward in lanes where enemy turrets will lie and, very likely, enemy teammates guarding their turrets or advancing the lane on their own. Turrets will do lots of damage to players. There would be monsters around the map to supply your team with buffs, this could also be a place to commonly meet enemy players in battle for these kills. After a lot of fighting, you would have pushed up on a lane so much, there aren't turrets anymore and you can enter the enemy base to take shit down.

Obviously, I don't think this exact model of MOBA would work for Titanfall, as this game is a whole different genre with different pacing and the need of level design. My point is is that I see a really good oportunity for Respawn to make a highly competitive (as well as casual) shooting game that could really set it apart from everything else out on the market.

(Major spoilers about everything)  Another way to word this question: how would you ideally leave off the TW2 in preparation for the Nilgaard invasion and TW3? What significant choices and events stand out to you that should be considered?

We can't even be sure what will matter or what will not matter for the plot of TW3, but there were some choices made during TW2 that seemed they could be pretty substantial for the defense or aid of Nilfgaard's invasion. For instance, who you left in charge of Temeria? Likewise, which monarchs died and which lived? What mages are still alive (like Sile or Cynthia)? Did you let Nilfgaard have Dearhenna's spying device and notes on the virus that took down the Vrans? What other significant events can you think of?

I just beat the game for the upwards of 7th time and I cannot be sure. Mainly this is just for discussion. :)

PS: I played it for the first time fully with the FCR mod. It was better with the mod, FOR SURE. It gave the game some more replay-ability and I would even suggest it to people who are on their first run through of the game. I feel like I should make a separate post about my experience with the mod and how it improved pretty much all the aspects of the game with only minor inconveniences.

But with a twist!  Hey all, I play a lot of FFA and decided to make my own FFA server that was less of a clusterfuck and more of a interesting combat challenge. 

The server name is Rathion's Melee FFA Challenge (No Archers), should be easy to find in the server list. It's based in Chicago and hosted by NFO.

The difference here is, it's a 12 man FFA, so more easily manageable encounters. There are no archers, it's only melee combat. Also, there is a limit per class. There can only be a maximum of 4 vanguards, 4 knights, and 4 maa. There's also a 120 ping limit to the server (thank god).

It also has every FFA map in the rotation that is currently offered, but I may remove some and/or add some custom maps later on.

I have a bad feeling about supporting Early Access games...  Maybe I've just dealt with one-too-many shady publishers/developers, but early access games just sounds like a bad idea more often than a good one. Sure, the idea is to get money flowing to indie teams while they make some cool games that people are willing to fund the development of, instead of AAA publishers giving the teams a check and advertisement space. And, during this steam sale, holy shit were a lot of early access games funded. DayZ (which I bought) is leading all of the sales charts against AAA that are even 75%+ off. Hopefully they won't, but after such a huge payout (which is probably close to what they would have hoped for on a FULL release) who is to say they don't just take their fucking time in development and leave it in Alpha forever while mooching their Early Access sales cash? I dunno, man. I supported a good handful of early access games this sale, as did a lot of people I know. I hope it doesn't bite us in the ass. This early access funding system seems exactly what the gaming industry needs to boost indie sales and encourage innovated games to be developed. Maybe if there was a refund option for early access games (at least while they remained early access).

What are some of your guy's thoughts on supporting Early Access games? Especially big titles like DayZ (which is OMFG so much fun).  Been handcuffed here for like 20 something minutes now. Man look at those graphics!    My first time playing this game has given me one intense story to tell. What an amazing and surreal game DayZ is.  This was my first experience in the game DayZ. I knew what the game was about and I had a basic idea of what I was getting into, but oh man... I had no idea I was going to experience something like this. 

Luckily I had help. If not for the people in my Teamspeak channel, I would have been lost in the woods for days, starving of hunger, with no sense of direction. There were five of us in Teamspeak. Of those five there were 3 rookies (myself included, Billy, and Tom), 1 novice (let's call him Soldier) and one pro (let's call him Captain). Our first objective? Meet up in a town north of Kamenka, a town called Pavlovo. As I explored the local buildings and fields around my spawn (and being greeted by my first hostile bullets to the face), I started grasping the basic concepts: don't starve, don't get shot, get storage space, fill the storage with supplies, and don't trust anyone. After a couple of lives, I made it to Pavlovo with some food, soda, and a backpack.

I was the first to arrive. Soldier and Captain were on their way and close by, ""fully geared"" they said. They'll meet me in front of the church. Why waste time? I went to check out a barn that was in sight. Nothing to loot, better head back, I thought. ""Rathion, if that's you, go prone!"" I froze. My heart jumped. ""Rath!? Go prone!"" I found the correct button on the keyboard and laid on the ground, nervously. ""Good, let's get you a gun while we wait for the others."" As I stood up, I got my first up close look at them. These are some rugged motherfuckers, I thought. The type of people you don't want to fuck with. Assualt rifles in hand, axes on their backs, with gas masks and helmets and ballistic vests and cargo pants covering them completely. I was glad to be on their side. One of them started eating from a box of cereal.

From a close-by military base, we picked up, for me, an M4. A little ammo was graciously supplied to me by Captain. We continued to search for supplies as the remaining two members of our soon-to-be squad were close-by. They had some food and water, but no weapons. Another M4 for one of them was found! We gave that to Billy. No more ammo to give out, though. ""This place is dry."", Captain exclaimed. ""There's a town north of us that could have some good stuff. Let's head there."" The five of us hit the road as a pack. Captain made a comment, ""This is a nice little army we have here. It'll do."" Humorous to me, I appreciated the site of our squad trotting along the road, 5 people with 4 assualt rifles in hand, I thought no one would dare fuck with us.

We arrived at our destination, a larger town named Zelenogorsk. Captain took lead. ""Keep your guns drawn and ready. Let's look for supplies and stick together."" First building: a new-old ballistic vest, second building: a little food, third building: a whole lot of nothing. We moved forward. The city opened up a bit to what looked like an abanded parking lot in front of a large white building. Captain and I went inside to have a look. ""I don't see anything on the first floor"", I exclaimed and started up the stairs. Noticing my hunger message popping up, I pulled out a can of sardines and started munching. Captain also grabbed a bite to eat. ""Put your guns down!"" My heart sank. I didn't recognize that voice. Was it from Teamspeak!? No, I don't think so. ""Put the goddamn guns down!"" I looked around and I looked at Captain, we were alone in this building. He started moving to the back door, I went to the front, the way we came in.  ""PUT THE GUNS DOWN NOW!"" Through the door I could see Soldier and the ammo-less Billly with their guns pointed to my left across the parking lot. Soldier yelled into the mic, ""Be cool, man! Be cool! Put the guns down! You're gonna get shot! You're gonna get shot!"" As I leaned around the corner, I realized the situation. Solider and Billy were facing off against a squad of 3 visible surivors, all very armed. But these hostiles didn't know about me and they didn't know about Captain who was working a flank and no one was going to put their guns down. My heart felt like it was going to burst through my chest.

Crack! Crack! Crack! I see muzzle flashes from their vocal member. I fire into his chest, he drops. Billy drops. I see Soldier is burst firing from the corner of my eye, another hostile drops. The third hostile I saw turns and runs back, full sprint, into a field behind the large white building. There's a vantage point on the second floor, I remember! I turn and run upstairs as fast as I can. Captain shouts into Teamspeak, ""There's another one!"" I hear shots fired as I look out of the window. A ragdoll hits the ground and relaxes into the grass behind the building. A hostile survivor is fleeing into the distance, so I pull up my gun. I didn't get a shot off in time before he dissappeared. ""Loot the bodies. Fast! Take everything you can!"", shouts Captain. From my vantage point I tell them I see three dead hostiles. The one I shot, he looked geared. Was I supposed to feel excited about this? ""Why can't I press F on his corpse?"", I ask. ""He's probably unconscious."" Captain walks over with his pistol and puts a bullet in his head. ""He's all yours."" I took everything. 

Tom managed to remain hidden from the battle. Probably a wise tactical decision for someone without a weapon. Soldier, Captain, and I were unharmed. We lost Billy. Solider and I exchange celebratory raves as the adrenaline wears off and Captain lets us know that we should move on. So, we got our shit together and left.

This game has given me an experience like no other game has done so before. One that I will not forget and one that I hope whoever reads this enjoys hearing about. No other game has been able to deliver such an intense and surreal situation to me that I was able to be a part of and help determine the outcome. I imagine this won't be the last time DayZ gets my heart racing and I look forward to having more stories to tell. 

Cheers.
  Cracking an egg underwater!    Cracking an egg underwater    Ello, poppets.  We'll see what happens.  Alright ChivalryGame, let's have a talk about this subreddit...  So, let's say I'm a new Chivalry player and I'm really starting to like it so I come around to this sub to check out some discussions. Here is my first impression of the community based off the past month's worth of posts: ""lol noobs are bad"" and ""DAE HATE TORN BANNER"".

I've been meaning to type up a thread like this for a while. Man, reading posts in this subreddit has become exhausting with all the negativity spouted at every aspect of the game (most of which is unfounded, circlejerk style criticism). Are there things to complain about? Sure. Should these be the focus of everyone's attention all the time? Perhaps not. 

If I didn't know any better (like a new subscriber), I would assume that everyone who plays this game fucking hates it. The only things that get upvoted (besides the: look at all the noobs I can kill screenshots) are posts like ""Deadliest Warrior sux becuz lmb spam"" and ""QQ I want more mods, torn banner QQ"". You know what? There's so much lmb spam in deadliest warrior because everyone sucks ass at it just like noobs lmb spam in MW. And jesus christ, mods are just starting to roll out and be fun, have some patience, this isn't Skyrim.

Ugh. This is an innovative, cheap-ass ***indie*** multiplayer action game from a team of rookie developers built on an old engine that's used mainly for shooter style games. Deadliest Warrior is a fun $15 mini game that gets TBS an extra flow of money to keep motivation (and looks good to future investors/publishers). Panic parry isn't the devil, like many high ranking people may spout, and (in my opinion) helped the game much more than people think. But the weapon unlock bug sucks, so that's okay to bitch about at times.

This game is a blast and we need to focus on the fun and joy that it brings. That's the point of gaming, no? Our community needs to be about getting people better at playing, finding people to play with, and sharing the good times. I'm tempted to make my own subreddit called chivalryfun for this reason. Reddit is a powerful tool that can really help or hurt this game progress and get better with both content and playerbase. And right now, I don't think this sub is helping at all. For anything.

tl;dr - Too many grumpy people bringing down the man.

EDIT - Examples would probably help my cause.

Where MW is like a game of delicate swordplay, DW is a riot of badassery built off the same combat system that I love very much. So, I see people trying to relate the performance of the classes in DW in the same way you would scrutinize a class in MW, which isn't exactly fair to the new classes' purposes. Deadliest Warrior has the finesse of the combat system from MW but, with the game sped up so, and with the larger maps, the roles of the classes has more variety than simply their ability to cross blades.

First, I want to talk about pirates. If an excess of people play pirates, it's not because they are OP, it's because they are awesome! In groups, a firing line of pirates is a tough situation to take down. A few things I might change about pirates are their fuses. I would make the fuse of the gun (the delay when you fire it) to be a random time. Maybe the gun will go off right after pulling the trigger, maybe there will be more of a delay. This variation in timing will add an edge to aiming and make it less point and click for them. Also, maybe a chance for the gun to miss-fire (the fuse not to light). What would be more fun than charging up to a pirate, hoping he doesn't shoot you, the gun barrel right in your face and click! A 5% chance of miss-fire happens and you laugh heartily as you chop off the pirate's head. Yar har and a bottle of rum.

Ninjas are another class that does well in groups of themselves. A traveling pack of ninjas is a hilarious sight of  shhhh, and no sound. A lot of people have been calling ninja the new man at arms. While there are similarities, the role of the class is different in the two games. With such a fast paced game as DW, the squishiness of ninjas plays a bigger part of their lives than it does for MAA. In 1v1, ninja's rolls can go either way for them when it comes to avoiding damage or taking it. And spears are very deadly against them. All I would change for them would be a way to hold the ninja star in the ready-to-throw position to aim better and the tear gas stuff, if TB wants that to be a free hit, only one tear gas per ninja. Having two and using them both correctly can be a free kill. No no.

Vikings are pretty cool. Not really my cup-o-tea but I have given them a thorough play. I think, to be more effective, their special ability (which increases their attack speed of the combo each time they land a hit) needs to be more noticeable in the first couple hits in the combo. Otherwise it's pretty worthless in a game as faced paced as this. Perhaps a health boost, too? I feel the role of a viking is more knight-ish and support damage. So maybe trade the Samurai's huge armor with the Vikings.

So, Spartans and Samurai. These classes have both a similar role in DW. I think that once Samurai vs Spartan (the game mode) is balanced, these classes are balanced within the game. A good Samurai/Spartan should be more powerful than the other classes in raw combat. These classes are the damage dealers, the badass warriors, the front line of combat. I do think Samurai need a health nerf. They shouldn't have that much armor as a knight. I thought Spartans were under-powered at first, then I played them more, now I think it's going to get really bloody once people start getting better at the class.

For Knights, I don't have much to say. I think they fit into the classes of DW very well and their roles are about the same as from Medieval Warfare. Knights do have crossbows which is a good point to bring up because the idea of archer hate shouldn't really exist in Deadliest Warrior. All classes have archer qualities and that's because classes need to be able to handle more in this game. Another difference from MW.

The main problem I see with this game is simply team balance. People bitch about Samurais winning but that wouldn't happen (necessarily) if they didn't outnumber everybody. TB needs to work a class limiter into servers to keep the teams even. The game mode is Ninjas vs. Spartans vs. Pirates and there are 24 people in the server? 8 per team sounds like the way to go.

So, what does all this make Deadliest Warrior? This game is like a TF2/Counter Strike style of Chivlary. Even more so with an SDK in the picture. The gameplay is fast and dynamic. Groups of enemies trekking around the large maps makes a much larger variety of combat encounters that can be crazily satisfying to come across and participate in. I can play the same game modes over and over and each game will be very different and I have a blast all the time. Lighten up, guys! I know there's a lot of mixed feelings about Chivalry and Torn Banner but just go with the flow and have fun! We may have a great time-piece of a game on our hands. Now, off to play some DW.

Cheers, Rath.

P.S. - I HAVE SO MUCH GAME FOOTAGE. I don't even know what to do with it all. It's all so awesome but I don't have time to edit anything together. :(  Seriously, why does this game keep deleting my cars?  The impound lot has not worked for me as (I assume) it is supposed to. I'll have a nice modified car in my garage, I'll take it out for a spin, die from something, it's gone forever. Or, I'll take my car out to a mission, the mission makes me drive another car, my car is gone forever. Hell, sometimes I'll turn on the game and my garage will be empty when there definitely should be cars in it (which is what made me make this post). I have about 20 hours of game play now and I've lost 7 or 8 cars that I've spent money on, put in my garage, saved the game and yet they never show up in the impound when I leave them somewhere. It really makes me not want to play anymore, but it's so fun. :( Am I doing something wrong? I'm tired of wasting money.  When the six-eyed bull plays FFA. Good footage of the day.    Ch",0

subject2240,"    Makes perfect sense. I just emailed you.     Haha, I love it! Very clever, very funny stuff. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I would love to post there if you would like to have it.     Right now, just here. Hopefully one day I can find another good place to post - do you know of any? 
I am on YouTube also: you can follow this link for my video attempts at comedy!
https://www.youtube.com/user/subject2240     You have no idea how much that means to me, thank you so much! It's feedback like that that keeps me going. I hope you continue enjoying! :)  Teenager Regrets Accepting Crazy Aunt's Friend Request  BETHESDA, MD  Jake Mayer, 15, received a Facebook friend request from Sheila Abernathy, his crazy aunt, last week. Facing external pressure, Jake was forced into accepting the request, at which point chaos ensued.
	I hate my crazy aunt! began a frustrated Mayer. She shares all those viral posts, like Share this if you hate cancer, or I love my mother. Like this in 5 minutes or else you hate your mother. I mean, how can she fall for that? Its unbearable Ms. Abernathy also uses Facebook to express political views, explained Jake. I always see those posts that have President Obamas face with a red X over it and says, Not my President!  its 2015 for crying out loud, get over it! Mayer continued by saying he receives about seven requests a day for Facebook games such as FarmVille, Candy Crush Saga, and Pet Shop Story.
	Its not the incessant posting that annoys Mayer so much. Jake stated that its his aunts nonstop perusing of his profile that bothers him most. He explains how no aspect of his profile remained safe. His aunt, who lives in Colorado Springs, Colorado, constantly likes his photos and checks in on his life. Every day is a new crappy question! Hows school? How are your parents? Whos this person? It never ends! exclaimed a frustrated Mayer. Jake also expressed his disgruntlement over his aunts tendency to end every post with, XOXO LOVE AUNT SHEILA. I know who you are, and I know you love me, so just stop doing that! yelled Mayer. However, the biggest blow was yet to come.
     In April, Mayer was tagged in a picture with Jackie Richter, his classmate and love interest. The photo showed the two smiling together at a table in their schools lunchroom. When the picture made its way onto Jakes wall, his aunt posted a comment that opened up a sea of awkwardness at Chester A. Arthur High School, the school Jake currently attends. On the photo, Ms. Abernathy posted the following comment: Whos that girl in your picture? My future niece-in-law? LOL! XOXO LOVE AUNT SHEILA. Students at the high school dubbed it the comment heard round the lunchroom.
     I was mortified, a shell-shocked Mayer barely got out. His peers shared the same sentiments. I felt so bad for him; I was embarrassed vicariously through him! Mayers best friend, Peter Sarlo, explained. Sarlo continued, stating how Jake was bullied in the lunchroom for the two weeks following the event. Fortunately for Jake, his crush did not view the situation the same way. I dont know, began Ms. Richter, I thought it was cute in a weird kind of way. Despite a bout of bad luck, Jake seems to have dodged a bullet in that regard, though hes had no romantic luck with his crush.
     Jake ended by saying his extreme fears for the future. My parents wont let me block my aunt, or unfriend her, so I guess Ill just have to love with it, and pray she wont embarrass me again. Ms. Abernathy only released one statement on the matter: I just love my not-so-much-of-a-baby-anymore-nephew Jake! With three years still left in his high school career for Mr. Mayer, the only certain is that his future at Arthur High School may turn out to be quite bleak.
  Conservatives Pleased With Ruining Of Exam  NEW YORK, NY  Conservatives can once again sleep well at night knowing that the AP U.S. History exam has been ruined to their liking. The test wasnt patriotic enough, and now we can rest assured that Americas students are learning about the real America, and not all the ugly parts of our countrys past, stated Walter Banks, the main propagator for the movement.
	The movement started in Texas because of the 2014 changes to the exams standards. The test dangerously focused on controversial issues of American history, such as slavery. Yeah, we dont really love those parts, said Mr. Banks, so we decided its best to tweak them. According to the movements followers, the 2014 revision gave the test an agenda, increasing an emphasis on slavery and negative aspects of American history. Mr. Banks continued, This country is supposed to be the guiding light for the rest of the world! Its our God-given right to be superior, and to be a leader for all nations, and we lose that right when our negativity is displayed to the world. Theres a reason its American exceptionalism, and not Canadian exceptionalism or British exceptionalism.
	This statement thoroughly angered American exceptionalism. Thats ridiculous! Dont blame me for your desire to try and feel superior, you wackjob! said an angered American exceptionalism. American exceptionalism went on to say that it fears the new exam could pollute the minds of the youth and give a false impression of American history to todays students. The most alarming opinions, however, stem directly from the source: the exam.
	The exam has had a difficult time since the change. I know that I might be ruining the future of this country, and thus the world! a distraught AP U.S. History exam disclosed. Following the change, the exam is on the road to alcoholism, and has become a shut-in. I cant show my face to people! Im a giant lie! I dont know how Im supposed to live with myself finished the exam. Authorities have been encouraged by the exams family to keep an eye on it, in order to prevent any life-threatening (or fatal) incidents.
	When asked if he is pleased with his work, Mr. Banks gave just one word: very. He continued, We are extremely happy with the result. With this success, we are not going to stop at History. We are going to decrease the emphasis on evolution in the Biology exam, and remove altogether the Calculus exam, solely for the fact that its hard. Together, we will take back the American education system! 
      China and Finland could not be reached for comment, because they were in too much shock.  African Lion To Zambia: Peace Out, Cub Scout  LUSAKA, ZAMBIA  Baxter, a lion living in the Zambian savanna, has decided to take his future into his own paws and move to New York. In light of the senseless killing of Cecil the Lion in nearby Zimbabwe, in addition to general poaching, Baxter realized that savanna life isnt for him.
     Baxters discovery of the fragility of life made him feel the need to pursue his dreams of the theatre. I dabbled in community theatre shows around the savanna, but there were no performers who could inspire me to grow. I need that challenge and a change of scenery, explained Baxter. Baxter was a frequent performer at the Lusaka Savanna Theatre, and some of his favorite parts include The Phantom in The Phantom of the Opera, Tony in West Side Story, and Munkustrap in Cats. However, Baxter claims hes ready to put that all behind him and move on to the worlds biggest stage: Broadway.
     I have a cousin in Brooklyn, so I figured I could crash with him until I get on my four paws and support myself, said Baxter. I know it can be rough to be an animal getting on Broadway, but I plan on making some cash to take classes and make connections. I know its not easy, but I really want it, and thats what matters, finished Baxter.
     The difficulty for animals getting onto Broadway is a recognized fact. Oliver, the canine known for originating the part of Annies dog in Annie, toiled for seven years before landing the role. When his tenure in the show expired, Olivers life went on a downward spiral, as detailed in his autobiography, The Sun Wont Come Out Tomorrow: No Easy Street (Penguin Random House).
Despite all of this, Baxter remains positive. Yeah, I know about Olivers story, but I still have to know what could happen  I cant live with what ifs! Baxter expounded. To support animals like Baxter and special animals unlike Baxter, be sure to visit www.wildcru.org.
  Stacy's Mom Still Upset With Neighborhood Boys  WAYNE, NJ  Dolores Peters, the notoriously hot mother of Stacy Peters, still holds a grudge with the Wayne boys who broke the news of her good-looks to the world. In 2003, the band Fountains of Wayne released their hit record, Welcome Interstate Managers. The third track on the album, a song entitled Stacys Mom, skyrocketed the band to the top of the charts and put Waynes hottest mom in the spotlight.
     I watched those boys grow up! I cannot believe what they did to me, to my life. Not just the message, but referencing my divorce when it was still so fresh a wound for our familythat hurt the most, an outraged Mrs. Peters said. After the release of the song, crowds flocked to 3645 Kent Avenue, home of the Peters family, to catch a glimpse of the Helen of Troy of New Jersey. Ew, what creeps! complained Stacy Peters. I invited them over for like, one chemistry study sesh and this is what they do?! Shes like so much older than them, and theyre gross. Pervs! she continued. While the women of the Peters family are irate, others dont see the situation in the same way.
     My songwriting mentor always told me to write from my heart, so I did, explained songwriter Chris Collingwood. He continued, I went to Stacys house for a chemistry review session. I got bored with the material, so I started daydreaming and realized how weird it was that Stacy is so plain, but her mom is so hot. That thought, mixed with the notion of writing from the heart, made the choice obvious. I feel kinda bad that theyre pissed, but I wouldnt change anything. Eli Baker, a friend of the band and Wayne resident, agreed with the bands message and added that shes totally bangin!
     New Jersey plans to move on from the incident. Governor Chris Christie stated that he hopes the olive branch will be extended and that both parties can live comfortably together, or as comfortably as one can live in the hellhole that is Wayne, New Jersey. The governor acknowledges that music feuds can get quite ugly, and he remains optimistic that the state can avoid a situation like Michael Jackson and Billie Jean Hannon, the inspiration for the smash hit Billie Jean. Only time will tell what happens, and though it might be wrong, 12 years later were all still in love with Stacys mom.
     The hair would probably make a better President, for sure.  TLC Runs Out Of Weird Crap To Air  SILVER SPRING, MD  The television network TLC announced that they have officially run out of new, unnecessarily strange ideas to air. Network executives explained today that, following the premiere of a show about unnaturally tall women, the well has run dry. It all started with Jon and Kate Plus Eight  once we lost Jon and were stuck with just that horrible mother, things went downhill, explained TLC spokeswoman Jodi Avalon. Then came the whole ordeal with Honey Boo Boos mother. Top it all off with the Duggars? Our credibility plummeted. Ms. Avalon stated that a decreasing credibility leads to an immediate need for more ideas, which in turn hinders production in the long-run.
	The network has hit almost every genre unknown to man. We got Amish kids who dont want to be Amish anymore; Eskimos who want to leave the Eskimo lifestyle; babies; breakups; sex stories; funny AND serious 911 calls; little people; giant people; transgender people; bad tattoos; weird addictions; random ER visitswe figured we couldnt lose! explained network president Larry Garner. Its hitting us hard now, we have no new ideas to show, and a lot of our old ideas cant be put on re-runs becauseyou knowlawsuits, the president expounded.
	Network executives are not the only ones affected by the terminated output. Long-time TLC viewers are fed-up with the network as well. Everyone needs a little TLC? Ha! Not anymore! said Jamie Summers of Cleveland, Ohio. I used to watch the network every morning, afternoon, and night. But now Im a truTV girl  Id watch those improbable jokesters or whatever the show is called over TLCs dreck any day! Ms. Summers stated. Brian Hannon of San Diego, California, also expressed unhappiness with the network. Yeah, it sucks, Mr. Hannon described. I mean, I like seeing their stuffI dont know, I just get tired of the same old shows. I want something new and fresh. Like, cant they air meaningful shows? Eh, who am I kidding? Im still gonna watch the show about the giant women, he finished.
	So whats next for the network in danger? TLC representatives claim that old ideas might be revamped. Weve got a dozen shows about people with mental health issues, so why not take it to a new level  dogs with OCD! Whats their day-to-day like? Can they get treatment? Will they accept treatment? Its brilliant! an excited President Garner explained. If thats not your things, Ive got one better  obese koalas! Theyre so cute and cuddly, a show about koalas that have more to love in my mind screams winner! While President Larry Garner is excited for the changes, reactions from the viewers remain to be seen. The season premiere for Paw-sitive Change: A Dogs Journey to OCD Recovery is set for some time next year.
     Either way, it'd be quite the ticket!  Donald Trump Names Hair His Running Mate  NEW YORK, NY  Just days after announcing his candidacy for President, billionaire Donald Trump has officially named his hair his running mate. Weve been together through thick and thin, and we need to stick together now more than ever, Trump explained. 
     Trump raises a good point: together, the two have built luxury hotels across the globe, amassing unspeakable wealth and becoming moguls in the industry. Donald took me in, gave me a home, taught me everything I know, explained Donalds hair. The hair continued, When I heard he was running for President, I pitched some of my ideas to him and he loved them. He even included them in his speech! Said Donald, All that stuff about Mexico and the wall? That was all the hairs idea. Its truly a brilliant entity. 
     Pollsters said the inclusion of the hair as his running mate shoots Trump straight to the forefront of the race. No one has ever attempted anything like this, explains Gabe Winter of the Pew Research Center. Martin Van Buren toyed with the idea, but never followed through. If Trump makes this ticket officialwe could be looking at our first hair Vice President, finished Winter.
     This news really brought a smile to Trumps running mate. JFK was the first Catholic President, Obama was the first Black President, imagine me as the first hair Vice President! Trump, too, was all smiles about the big news. If theres one thing I love, said Trump, its making history. Also, money. Im really rich. Only time will tell what happens for this potentially historic duo with 2016 quickly approaching, but this is undoubtedly the pair to observe in the upcoming caucuses and debates.
  Doctor Cured Of Ebola Misses The Attention  ESSEX, ENGLAND  Dr. Steven Samsonite, of England, spent two months tending to Ebola victims in Uganda before being transported to the United States for treatment after contracting the virus. Now healthy, Dr. Samsonite has developed a strong case of depression. When youre sick, everyone is like, Hey! Theres the sick hero doctor! Lets love him and give him a lot of attention! Now, Im just like everyone else again, lamented Dr. Samsonite. 
     The situation isnt just affecting the British doctor: his girlfriend of two years, Julia Irving, is feeling the struggle emotionally. I used to be special, too! Ms. Irving explained. People used to give me sympathy and food. Now Im just the average girlfriend. Do you know how hard that is? Dr. Samsonite gave us further insight into his depression. To see Julia so upset crushes me. But, justjust being normal is what hurts the most. Being a normy, an Average Joe if you will, is what disappoints us daily. To be in a market and hear, Cash or credit? instead of, This ones on us, Dr. Miracle-Performer! affects the psyche quite deeply. 
     So what does this disheartened couple have in store for the future? I think Im gonna go back to Uganda and somehow get infected again. I think its best for both of us. Ms. Irving agreed, adding, I dont want him to go away again, but this is what couples do. You make sacrifices for each other. Its why I love this man so much! What a truly inspiring story of enduring love.
  Woman Admits Tinder Match Not As Great As Expected  CHICAGO, IL  23-year-old Bridget Fowler of Chicago faced disappointment at the discovery that Todd Baxter, her Tinder match, was not as exciting in person. The discovery took place at Menschs Kosher Deli, on Chicagos South Side. His pictures looked so exciting! exclaimed Fowler. A college graduate, with a puppy, who went to Africa? Um, have you heard of being the total package? Swipe right! Fowlers dreams were soon to be dashed. She describes, When we first met in person, he was wearing a Cubs shirt and jeans. He was soaverage. Like, where was the Africa? And the puppy? And college? We each got sandwiches and he paid. It was painfully normal. 
     Todd did not agree with this. I had a great time, he said. She was fun, but a little ditzy. The whole time she kept asking me about Africa, even though I told her countless times I work at a nearby zooI guess shes not a very good listener. Despite that, I had a really good time, and I hope to see her again soon. Fowler did not have the same sentiments. Again? Hah, no thank you. I think once was enough with Tad, or whatever his name is. He was such a liar! I was all like, Oh my gawd tell me about the Taj Mahal! and he was just like, Bridget, Ive told you like, ten times that I work at a zoo. That wasnt from Africa, that was just me with an elephant in our zoo. Ugh, I hate liars! I met a new guy on Tinder, anyway. His name is Bobby, and he has a picture of him surfing, so he must be a lifeguard!  Fingers crossed with him  maybe the thirty-fifth time is the charm! 
     Todd met a woman named Stephanie through his best friend, and the two have been dating for about three weeks. Meeting someone through a friend is way better than trying an app! Getting to talk to them and get to know them in person instead of through a screen is super greatwho wouldve guessed?! Stephanie is a nurse who does Zumba and is a really great listener. I think thats what she said, I wasnt paying attention. We really complement each other, Baxter pointed out. Despite improbable odds, love lives on in The Windy City.
  Local Man Cuddled To Death  PARAMUS, NJ  Tragedy struck a New Jersey town today when Steve Wilmore, a 47-year old man from Paramus, was cuddled to death. The suspected culprit is Sophia, Wilmores 4-year old daughter. Shes a very affectionate childshe doesnt yet understand the havoc that she can cause, explained Tania Miller, who has lived next door to the Wilmore family for ten years now. Wilmores wife, Tammy, explained the whole situation while fighting back tears. This is almost expected, sort of a long time coming, she started, Sophia has been aggressive with him for a while now: the tight hugs, the tackling, giving him plastic foodI just cant believe its come to this. 
     Paramus police chief Sal Abattiello also weighed in on the issue. Toddler-related deaths have been on the rise in the last decade, Abattiello explained. Abattiello continued, Our calls used to be the interesting ones: domestic abuse, drugs, petty larceny, but now its all toddlers. Whether the kid strangled the parents, caused them to choke during a toy-shoving incident, or tripped them with some toy, these toddlers need to be stopped. 
     And stopping toddlers is precisely whats happening. The Paramus town board is cracking down on toddler abuse of elders. Susan Stanton, president of the town board, is proposing big measures to mend the situation. For too long this has been going on! exclaimed Ms. Stanton, Out with the old, in with the new  that deals with clothes, or food cans, but not members of society, and toddlers need to learn that. Its time we come together as a community and end this madness now. So what comes next for the community in mourning? Ive lived here my whole life, said Chief Abattiello, and I know that this community comes together in good times and in bad. Were closer now than weve ever been, and were finally ready to end toddler tyranny. Sophia could not be reached for comment.
  Blind Man Unimpressed By Aurora Borealis  REYKJAVIK, ICELAND  53-year-old Gil Collins, a blind man from Evansville, Indiana, had scathing reviews of his vacation in Iceland. I didnt even want to go; my wife wanted to go. If it was up to me, we wouldve been sitting on the beaches of Cancun. But we all know its always up to the wife. I just didnt think it would be THIS bad, Collins ranted. I dont know what his big fuss was all about, it was a lovely time! exclaimed Gils wife, Nancy. Yeah, I bet she said she had a great time, said Gil. She always has a good time. Shes a walking ray of sunshine who finds the good even in the worst trip. I kid you not, she had a good time in Brazil  and it wasnt even Carnival. According to Gils wife, Mr. Collins has difficulty in seeing the good in every vacation. We went to the Grand Canyon  he called it a useless hole in the ground. The Statue of Liberty  he called her some green whore! I just dont know what his problem is.
	Reykjavik Mayor Dagur B. Eggertsson was flabbergasted by this whole story. We make a lot of money each year in tourism. I dont know what this man isnt seeing that our millions of other visitors do. Mr. Collins wanted to clarify his case for Mayor Eggertsson. Ive seen better lights on a drug trip.  Keep your godless, freak nature lights, you socialist bastard. When asked if they would ever go on vacation again, the happy coupled agreed they would, but this time theyll let Mr. Collins choose the best place to go. Im thinking maybe Disney? said Mr. Collins. I dont know why, but I have a thing for animals pretending to be people. Funny stuff! Its why that Entourage show gets me every time. By asserting himself and his desires, Mr. Collins is proving to be a hero for both blind persons, and husbands, across the globe.
  Area Boy Admits He Took Grocery Bagger Job To Pay For College  AKRON, OH  17-year-old Jacob Lewis has been a grocery bagger at the local A P since he was 13 years old. The community always believed he was there for so long because he loved helping his fellow citizens. Lewis admitted today that he had an ulterior motive for taking the job. I just wanted to get some money for a car and collegeI didnt see what was so wrong about it. But now everyone hates meI shouldnt have lied. I cant believe what Ive done.  Ive been shopping there nearly my whole life, said 82-year-old Betty Jones, and Ive never seen a bagger like him. Hes never broken an egg or squashed bread. But now Ill never use him again!  The news rocked the supermarket. We were so shocked by this revelation, said A P manager Tom Johnson, we had to close the store down for the rest of the day. That hasnt been done at this store since the Cuban Missile Crisis. But Lewis employer isnt the only one surprised by this whole story. I always thought he was a good dude, said one of Lewis friends, who asked we not reveal his identity to his shame of being associated with the miscreant, but I guess I was wrong.  To lie to a whole community like this? Not cool, bro, not cool. The local school district is being investigated following the news of what Lewis has been up to. Cecilia Brown, the superintendent for Lewis school district, released a comment. Ive known him for a while.  He is a good student and a top-notch athlete.  This kind of lying and deceit is not something Id expect from him.  Some of his neer-do-well friends, maybe, but not him. This is going to have to go on his record. I dont know how colleges will accept him now. Yet the community heartbreak hit closer than his store or school: it hit his home. How can I trust him again? asked his sobbing mother, Eleanor. All these years I thought he did this menial job out of love, just to find out hes doing it to better himself? How do I explain this to his younger siblings?  Things are very tense right now. What does the future hold for this young man?  Yeah, hell still be employed here, said Johnson. Hes the best bagger Ive ever seen: he can bag even the toughest of customers in two minutes flat without breaking an egg or popping open a yogurt. Well probably just give him a mean nickname, like Sir Lies-A-Lot or something. Were terrible at giving nicknames, but huge fans of Babys Got Back, so were pretty proud of that one continued Johnson. An elated Jacob reflected on that news. Im so honored I can keep my job there. Id say Im glad because I love it, but since Im not lying anymore, Ill say its because Im only $52.76 away from a 2009 Honda Civic! Hopefully this community can mend its broken pieces, and that there will no longer be a figurative clean-up on aisle four.      ""There was just another piata inside it?!""     ""I've always dreamed of abolishing the Make-A-Wish Foundation...""  My Picks For The 2017 Stanley Cup Playoffs: Third Round By Abraham Lincoln  WASHINGTON, D.C.  We meet again, earnest reader! After yet another round of unsuccessful predictions, and Im not sure why, I am here to give you my predictions for the third round of these hockey postseason games. Apparently the winner of these games gets to vie for the whole thing! What an exciting time. Lets take a look:

Ottawa Senators vs. Pittsburgh Penguins: Well, I predicted both of these teams to lose. Twice! That is, frankly, impressively bad. Well one must win, so lets see if I get it right this time. I choose the Penguins of Pittsburgh. They defeated the good Union boys and the representatives of this nations capital, so these flightless birds are clearly vicious and unstoppable. Im afraid these Canadian boys dont stand a chance in this round.

Anaheim Ducks vs. Nashville Predators: No questions here! The Ducks will be victorious! Yet again Gordon Bombay will lead them to the championship! Stellar play by Ryan Getzlaf, Fulton Reed, Charlie Conway, Corey Perry, Dave Karp, and Ryan Kesler will surely lead this team to victory! Go Flying V and go Anaheim!

God bless,

""God, this is already a travesty!""  Jobs that definitely shouldn't make house calls.    My Picks For The 2017 Stanley Cup Playoffs: Second Round By Abraham Lincoln  WASHINGTON, D.C.  Hello again, kind reader! After my first round predictions were met with mediocrity, I was asked to give my predictions for the second round as well! Again, I have a very limited knowledge of hockey, but Ill do my best. Here goes nothing:

New York Rangers vs. Ottawa Senators: One of my few correct first round picks, I think Texs Rangers will do it again! These Union-allied boys will certainly clean the rink with those northern Canucks! Theyve shown what it takes to win on the battlefield: strength, determination, good leadership, and a lack of dysentery. The Rangers will win!

Washington Capitals vs. Pittsburgh Penguins: Washington must win! They represent our nations capital, and we need to show the countrys strength! Also, those Penguins defeated the Blue Jackets, so I have reason to believe theyre aligned with the Confederates. Its precisely for reasons like this that I suspended habeas corpus! The Union must be preserved, so I call this series for the Capitals!

St. Louis Blues vs. Nashville Predators: Well, I predicted that St. Louis would come out victorious, but I did not predict victory for Nashville. They defeated my boys from the land ofwell, me, Lincoln! Maybe theres more grit there than I expected. A young, feisty bunch of rebellious boysI dont normally support the rebels, or rebs, but I am going to choose them this time. You cant fool me twice, so Nashville will win this series!

Anaheim Ducks vs. Edmonton Oilers: Ducks again! Ducks again! I told you Gordon Bombay would win them the first round, and hell do it again. Break out the Flying V, boys! Ducks will win!

God bless,
President Abraham Lincoln  Questions that will always be answered with a 'No.'       I'd watch this for hours.     ""I planned the whole thing!""  My Picks For The 2017 Stanley Cup Playoffs: First Round By Abraham Lincoln  WASHINGTON, D.C.  Hello, America and beyond! It is I, the 16th President of the United States of America, Abraham Lincoln. Today, I am here to give you my break down for the first round of this years Stanley Cup playoffs, whatever that means.

When I was asked to do this, I was quite confused. I was never much of a hockey person, and I know so very little of it in todays times. Regardless, Im not one to disappoint, so heres my breakdown for this years first round matchups:

Montreal Canadiens vs. New York Rangers: Now, I have to choose Texs Rangers! Im so confident that our American boys can beat this team to our north that I dont even care their star player is from Sweden! Habitants or not, Im calling this one in favor of the Rangers.

Ottawa Senators vs. Boston Bruins: An American team named for a bear? Why, Ill definitely have to choose the Bruins! Besides, when was the last time anyone saw a senator get work done? In my days, that was known as a political zinger! I call this series for the Bruins.

Washington Capitals vs. Toronto Maple Leafs: A third go-around for an American team taking on a Canadian team? What a world we live in! And this American team plays in and represents our capital? These boys really seem represent our Union and what it means to be American! What? Their star player is Russian? Ah, well, Ill still call this one for the Capitals.

Pittsburgh Penguins vs. Columbus Blue Jackets: Blue Jackets?! Blue Jackets?! Why even bother holding other contests? These Union boys will go all the way! No Penguins or Confederates can keep these men down! I call on them to win the whole shebang!

Chicago Blackhawks vs. Nashville Predators: Blackhawks and Predators. Both are fierce warriors! A fine, tough people versus a very general representation of beings that hunt and feast on other beings. This will be a tough series, but Im going to have to pick the team that comes straight from the Land of me, Lincoln: the Blackhawks!

Minnesota Wild vs. St. Louis Blues: Two American-bred teams in one series makes it difficult to predict. Sure, Minnesota is the State of Hockey, with passionate fans, a hard wilderness, and strong players like Zach Parise and Devan Dubnyk. But St. Louis represents exploration and creativity. With strong goaltending from Jake Allen and equally strong players in front of him, such as Vladimir Tarasenko and Alex Pietrangelo, I think St. Louis is going to best Minnesota in this series.

Anaheim Ducks vs. Calgary Flames: You wont find a bigger fan of the 1996 movie The Mighty Ducks than yours truly, which is why there is no doubt this series will end with an Anaheim victory! I mean, with powerhouses like Ryan Getzlaf and Corey Perry, not to mention the brilliant coaching of Gordon Bombay, I dont see how they could lose! Go Flying V! Go Ducks!

Edmonton Oilers vs. San Jose Sharks: Well, truthfully, I dont even know what an oiler is! Steam is the way for me, so I cant imagine theres a team named for a person who is involved with oil? Sharks are intimidating enough, so Ill choose them. Frankly, neither team sounds like winners. Can they both lose? No? Okay, San Jose then!

God bless,

I'm probably the first one you've heard of, because in our society we do not often find those three words paired consecutively. To add to it, I am an Orthodox Jew, complete with the full suit and the Kippah, also known as a Yamaka to the majority of the population. I even have a special tailored pocket in each one of my suit jackets for my specially engraved M1911. Like I said, I'm a gun-toting Jew.
 
On top of being a part of this extremely specific sect of society, I am a history major, specializing in the historical injustices committed against the Jewish people. Despite the unfortunate thins that have happened to my ancestors, I find the area extremely interesting.  So much so that even after I finish my daily research at the local university, I go home and watch documentaries into the ungodly hours of the night.
 
It was just another night, one of the many that follow a laborious day of investigating the genocides of my long lost cousins, and per the usual I went home and watched the first documentary I saw. This unfortunately, happened to be a holocaust documentary.
 
My job was to study instances such as the holocaust, yet every time I saw Adolf Hitler on a television set I would be filled with this insatiable rage, feeling the pent up anger for the 6 million Jews lost corse through my veins. So as he stood up, angrily spewing racial denunciations to the people of Nuremberg, I felt myself once again shake with that uncontrollable ferociousness. This time however, it was like nothing I had ever felt. 
 
 Sure, a rage like this had caused me to break a coffee table once, but this anger was so deep, so controlling, that I unconsciously pulled my gun out of my suit pocket and aimed the gun, one loaded with artificial vengeance, at the head of Adolf Hitler. 
 
I closed my eyes, I couldn't concentrate anymore. The gun was still held there, just waiting for me to make a decision.
 
The recoil of the pistol and the explosion of sound combined to augment the shock I had just experienced, but as I finally opened my eyes to see the electronic disaster I surely had caused, I instead saw 3 neat holes, and then motionless Adolf Hitler in a Nazi uniform that had much more red than usual. It appeared that I had just killed Adolf Hitler.
 
Theres no way.  Its just a television. This cannot be happening.
 
The thoughts raced through my head, but they finally came to a conclusion that if my anger was powerful en ought to get me to shoot at a television containing a man who had been dead for 70 years, then it must be powerful enough to cause me to hallucinate.
 
So I went to bed, yet as I turned my light off, I couldnt help but notice the fading of most cherished book The Diary of Anne Frank, as it always had sat on my nightstand.
 
I really need to move that book from out of the sunshine, I thought.  Nonetheless, it was a task for tomorrow, so I fell asleep. 
 

                                                               

 

When my world really began to change was when I woke up and noticed the cover of my most cherished book had gone blank, just as every other page in the book.  Wordless, it was simply bound paper, unable to tell the story of a young persecuted Jewish girl.  I tried not to think about it for fear of the consequences, so I ate breakfast and was off to work.



Once I had gotten to work, there were 3 messages on my desk phone; two from my mother, and one from a so-called Great Uncle Blumberg.  The two calls from my mother were simply chastisements for not answering this Blumberg fellows calls, and then his call turned out to be an invitation to dinner.  Considering I had not the slightest idea who he was, I did quick research, and found that he was born in Germany in the early 1930s and then emigrated to the States in the 1950s.  Why I had never heard of him, only God knows.



Acknowledging that this may have been my lifes most peculiar start to a day, but nonetheless I kept trying to carry about my own business.  However, as I opened my latest research paper, just like The Diary, it too was blank.  I turned to my primary source, a manuscript from Nazi Germany.  It too was blank. My world was changed in front of my eyes, and I was beginning to legitimately panic, so I looked up Adolf Hitler just to reassure myself that I hadnt magically caused this all. Sure enough the entry read:

            Adolf Hitler: A promising young radical politician who was assassinated shortly into his political career.  Just sixth months after taking office, he was assassinated at a rally despite his immense popularity, and it served as a further blow to German nationalism. Shortly after his death, the entirety of Germany succumbed to Soviet rule, simply because inflation was so rampant that the Germans could no longer support themselves.



I must have fainted, because when I woke up, I read it all again, and it was still all true.  The holocaust never happened, my Great Uncle had never died, and neither had Anne Frank.  I had effectively wiped out the worlds most tragic genocide with one rage fit that involved shooting a TV.  I was a changed man because of the experience, but it was apparent that the world was greatly changed as well.     Hello Governor Johnson and Governor Weld, I greatly appreciate you taking the time to answer Reddit's question, and I will be voting for you in November in Kansas! My question is, what is your stance on the killing of Harambe? Was he murdered in cold blood, or killed for a phony cause?

     I was probably 5 and was having a nightmare, and I thought I woke up, but when I opened my eyes I saw a 4 foot tall version of FDR's head staring at me and I just lost my shit.

Anyways, there was one Chiefs player that said hi to me and was pretty nice, but I was pretty nervous because I was about to go out there. I get out to midfield, and as all the players are shaking hands I stand there awestruck at the size of these guys. Sure enough, as I'm standing there, rather reserved, and of the five Chargers that were out there, Phillip Rivers goes out of his way to shake my hand. He was the only player in the entire huddle to do so, and to this day, it pains me to see all of the complaints that he's a whiner, and he's unappreciative. He made one kind act he didn't need to, and a lot of people don't realize what kind of impression that has on a kid.     s.

He started from the bottom of the totem pole, so he had people be beaten down in his parking lots, and experienced quite a few scary moments. He was never robbed, but he had his stores robbed twice. Once with a stick, once with an uzi. However, despite working in this rough setting, he was able to start programming while working there back in the 80's, and learned to be thrifty with computers as the industry popped up. He came on as tech support in a few jobs, and after gaining experience, he moved to a lower level manager, and then a mid-level manager, and now he is CIO at a 200 person company, which is basically head of IT and a few other departments. It was truly 10 years of 70 hour work-weeks, complimented by the luck of an industry popping up around him.

""You're beautiful""     Some people called him a monster, some called him a beautiful beast, and some called him a distant relative. What I called him? Food. 

The obsession began in the 1980's. I had always been poor, raised in a single parent household after my father died, but after taking advantage of a market inefficiency during the energy crisis of the late 1970's, I became very wealthy.  With the ridiculous sum of wealth, I retired immediately, and began to find ways to entertain myself. After experimenting for a time, I joined a posh country club, met a few friends, and after a time we got very comfortable with each other. We were all rich, and we were all bored with the mundane life of the bourgeoisie, so at the suggestion of one of the friends, we decided to go big game hunting in Africa. He had already planned his dream hunt, so we followed his lead.

It was the spring of 1986 when we landed in Brazzaville, the capital of Congo, and we were eager to assert our dominance over the most powerful mammals in the world. I did not know much about hunting at that point in time, but when I learned we were going to the Congo, I was fairly surprised, for the lack of true big game throughout African jungles. I voiced my concerns to the friend who had planned it all, Reginald, but he said there was a surprise he had up his sleeve.

It was the first day, and off we went into the Congo jungle, looking for the prey that was unbeknownst to me. I was initially shocked to find the lack of necessary documentation, such as tags and such, but the guide assured us that the Congo government used an honors system, one that trusted citizens to use their own judgment. 

After just a day, we came upon a Silver-backed Gorilla. I was in awe of the beautiful creature, sitting in the sunny opening, grazing on the dense foliage. It was truly a picturesque sight, until it was violently interrupted by the report of the .50 caliber hunting rifle, and then the thud of the formerly majestic gorilla.

""What the fuck was that?"" I frustratedly screamed, knowing the extreme consequences of killing such a protected animal.

""This is real hunting my friend,"" answered the guide, in broken English, as both he and Reginald maniacally grinned. Shocked, I went back to the tent, puked, and sat by myself, pondering me the events that had just unfolded.

Approximately two hours later however, the group came back, dragging the gorilla. Before the entire group had even let go of the fallen beast, the guide pulled a knife out of his pocket, and lunged for the gorilla's chest. After a minute of crude surgery, he pulled out the still warm heart of the beast.

""In our country, we take a bite of the warm heart of the first kill. Our ancestors have done it for thousands of years, and now it is your turn.""

I still had a little bit left in the tank, so I turned, puked again at the suggestion of this appalling savagery, but after hotline hostile badgering, I was forced to take a bit out of the half eaten heart. 

Flies buzzed, and as I sank my teeth into the heart, the blood smeared onto my face. However, instead of the expected gag, the taste was glorious. Truly, it was my heroin. I took another bite, and then another, until Reginald peeled the piece away from me. I realized the savagery I had just indulged in, wiped my face off apologized, and went back to my tent.

As I fell asleep, I knew how hollow the apology truly was. I was addicted to the taste, to the thrill, to the concept of it all. I was a man, but for this glorious moment, I was one happy savage.

The gluttonous happiness quickly faded, as that was the only glimpse of a gorilla we got for the rest of the trip. The taste of the blood lingered even as I boarded the flight back to the states, and I realized that I would be back, and very soon and often. 

Sure enough, I was back every year for the next 13 years. The taste, the hunt, it was all exhilarating, and no law made by the hand of man could keep me back from my addiction. 

Just as I was planning my 2000 trip, the 15th anniversary of the original tasting, I was caught in the .com bust. Every major asset I held was in some way tied to it, so I lost everything I had. I stayed with Reginald for a time, and some of the others from the original crew, but because I had lost my money, I was no longer interesting to them.

Thus, I was left poor, lonely, and struggling with an unsustainable addiction. I had burned through the last of my riches, and after nearly ending up in the street, I realized it was necessary to get a job. 

After seeing a flyer, and with my addiction in mind, I decided to apply to the Cincinnati zoo. I knew it would be dangerous considering my past experiences, but the crave of gorilla gave me the perturbed concept that I would get an opportunity to strike and succeed in my quest to eat once again.

15 years of miserable work in the primate section of the zoo left me cold, desperate, and hungry to strike. Thus came the fateful day of May 28, 2016.

After feeding the gorilla in the exhibit, I was walking around the viewing area of the closure, when I experienced a seemingly spoiled, bratty child nagging his mother. He couldn't have been but 5 years old, but was continually begging for attention while his mother took care of his siblings, but after a few unfruitful attempts, he finally ran off to view the gorilla.

He was dangerously hanging over the edge of the enclosure, with both of his feet even leaving the ground multiple times as he hung onto the single restraining bar. As he precariously balanced on the bar, I saw my opportunity to strike, so I gave him a helping shove.

The screams followed. There were many, but because I was he closest zoo staffer, I was quickly alerted of the accident and was forced into action. The gorilla, Harambe, was easily spooked, and after hearing the screams, took the child into her protective custody, dragging him around the enclosure. Knowing the procedure for this absolutely unthinkable scenario, I eagerly gathered the gun and returned to the exhibit. 

The time to act was that moment, and after a fearful consensus from all the primate experts, they agreed a tranquilizer would be dangerous for the child, so the killing of the gorilla to save the boy would be necessary. As soon I heard the confirmation of my hopes, I shouldered the rifle, and fired the shot I had fired so many time in my past, one that pierced through the gorilla's skull, killing it immediately.

Everyone was traumatized, but being the professional I was, I realized I needed to distance the body from the scene. There was a crematorium, but that would not be necessary, so in the excitement of the crises, I was able to take the body to my car and leave immediately, knowing I would never come back.

After taking the first bite, I immediately knew the 15 years of work was easily worth it. Harambe was delicious.     Or just do coke instead of drinking it     It was another death. I had never met them, nor did they sound like the kind of person I would hang around. Sure, I felt that twinge of guilt that I could've done something, like  stick up just once for the kid who was bullied throughout elementary, or even reach out to him to console him. But no one does that. That's why I didn't do it.

The speaker, through his tears, was beginning to get rather droll, as I had heard the speech before. If I had to guess, 600 kids in that auditorium were in tears, and the other 300 were on their phones. Needless to say, the hollow guilt got to be too much, so I joined the latter demographic.

The little blue bird greeted me. To be honest, that was what I liked most about Twitter. Every time I opened the app, someone greeted me. Never in my life had someone gone out of there way to talk to me, even just saying hi or such, so I kept going back to Twitter, searching for the implicit approval I had never received in real life.

The problem got worse and worse. After starting my first Twitter account, I saw the stagnation in it, and viewed social media icons with envy. They had what I wanted, they had thousands of people adoring everything they said. Just even the facade of acceptance would satisfy me, just for me to have the impression of being liked once.

Surely, a second Twitter account would solve my problems of unimportance. Besides, personal accounts never get popular. Everyone knows that. With this seeming fact in mind, I started a baseball Twitter account. It seemed real, and it was from the heart, but still no one seemed to like it. So I created another one.

It was a clich account, very similar to Dory as many would've said, but it seemed as if everyone liked that so that's what I wanted to be. It was hollow and practically stole other people's intellectual property, but at this point, I just wanted to achieve happiness, because my pursuit through a social life was not going much better.

After being desperate and going for a girl who was way out of my league, I was no longer the bystander to the vicious ridicule, but instead now I was the victim. Why would I ever do something so stupid? Everyone else seemed to have a point, why would she ever want me? What did I have to offer?  Why would anyone want me? Obviously my real personality did not interest anyone, and apparently my fake, manufactured one hadn't either.

I figured the ridicule would stop, but it didn't. I heard the voices at day, and then after a few weeks, I heard the voices at night too.

""Why would you do something like that? Who do you think you are, Steve Holt?""

""She goes to prom with star athletes not losers.""

""I gotta give you credit man, if I were you, I would've killed myself by now.""

Sleep became restless: it became impossible to sleep more that two hours at a time for me. My grades, something I had always been able to hold onto in times of vain, began to slip along with my sanity. Those I had always pleased and felt accepted by, my parents, began to turn on me. It was pretty apparent that because I was no longer the successful child I once was, they hated me now. Sure enough, I was searching for their approval now too.

After a restless nights sleep, and a torturous day at school, I was tired. Tired from the pain, tired from the lack of sleep, and tired from all of the expectation I had failed to meet. I simply wanted to sleep, even if it meant more pain, but as I crept quietly into the house, I found my report card taped to my door, with a menacing note from my parents demanding that they call as soon as I get home.

Following an expletive laced rant, followed by dry, emotionless responses from yours truly, I was told to take a hard look in the mirror and find out what I was made of. So I did.

As I slinked into the bathroom, I stared at myself for a good couple minutes, questioning life's meaning, and questioning where my place was in it. I looked down, shut my eyes, tried to block out the voices, but as always, I failed. When I opened my eyes however, the first thing I saw was the shining glint of the razor, beckoning me to find out what I was made of.

Turns out I was made of hollow pain, and a lot of blood.

  harambe put the rill in gorilla       I felt a twinge of pain on a sunny afternoon, and I had no idea what had come of me. As I was still young and nave, I simply dismissed it as a growing pain, one of many in my growth and progress to adulthood. However, looking back, it was the first time I had ever felt it, and to this date it has been the only time I have felt it.

It wasn't a sharp pain, it was simply a pain in the darkest depths of my body; one so deep I could not locate it, but one that reverberated hopelessness throughout my entire being. I even remember the exact time it happened it was such a harrowing pain, one that interrupted my late May afternoon, one that had been previously filled with with joy.

That joy, just as all of my hope in life, quickly faded away as I began to feel an inalienable loneliness put my psyche into a stranglehold. I had never had a partner, even a girlfriend for the slightest minute, yet it felt like my wife of 50 years had died. Even though I had always been alone, this mysterious presence had been with me. Of course, until that fateful May afternoon.

The loneliness turned into depression, and after a low point coming in the form of unbridled tears behind a locked door, I was convinced to seek help. I saw a therapist, and while I struggled to voice my loss of a divine partner, it became apparent to all those sitting around me that I was borderline clinically insane.

Sure enough, I was prescribed the modern fix to most all problems, yet as I took the mountain of pills each day, I did not feel a reduction in the loneliness, but instead just a hollow numbness. It did alleviate the mental pain some, yet the",0

Current Hardware: http://imgur.com/a/b1l6s

I'm looking to upgrade my receivers- mostly because I'm tired of watching MLBTV inside the chrome browser (instead of a native app) but also because I think it's time for a needed change. My problem is that the A/V cabinet where the receivers are and the television sit a long (100' or so of cable run distance under an older house) way away. With newer tech like chromecasts/apple/fire/android TV out there all using HDMI this really limits my surround sound ability. I currently have digital audio to the surround receiver (TX-SR601) via 2x 50' of optical cable with an amp in-between (that I haven't had problems with, besides my current limitation) and the Google TV acts as a passthrough for the DirecTV or anything I watch natively (Plex/Youtube/Netflix etc). As for the other (read: ancient) amp, it's an Onkyo TX-903 stereo that delivers sound throughout the house with the help of the Niles SPS-6. We use it in conjunction with the SR601 to play music via a different input (as digital audio can't be pushed through the zone2 output) 

Couple of other facts:

I use those old Radioshack IRRF extenders (the ol' pyramids) and they are inconsistent at best.
I have 6.1 channel surround speakers that are not moving (unless demolition is in order)
I have networking (cat5) in both locations, but independently they go back to the router (in an even better spot far away)
I will be upgrading the TV in the near future, but not right meow.
The Google TV box throws a kink in my solution, but with the blu ray player and the DTS passthrough (amongst other things) I would like to keep it if I could-


I guess that brings me to a few questions-

Am I about to be running a ton of cables in order to upgrade these suckers? Could I replace the TX-903 with the SR-601 and just run it in stereo? Is there some super simple solution I haven't thought of? 

Any input would be super helpful- even laughing at my current setup so I can help justify this upgrade...      Nice work. [Here's](http://i.imgur.com/A3TuOrp.png) a link to the #, Name, and type.

The teacher chuckles to herself and says, ""Well Johnny, I was looking for 3 minus 1 = 2, but I like the way you're thinking.""

Little Johnny says, ""Alright Teach, I've got one for you: Three blondes are sitting in an ice cream parlor eating ice cream cones. One of them licks from the side, one licks from the top, and the other sticks the whole thing in her mouth and swallows it in one gulp. Which one is married?""

The teacher thinks about it for a few seconds and responds:

""The one that swallows it all in one gulp?""

Little Johnny says, ""No Teach, the one with the ring on her finger- but I like the way you're thinking""

She completely ignored me. I said ""Kelly? Are you ok?"". Ignored me. I kept asking questions and she didn't even look up at me. I just walked away super confused and sad. I never did her wrong or gave any reason for her to just completely disregard me. She was always a bitch tho and I ended up  making great new friends.

At this stage you will have a complete background layer free of warping and the layer with the person adjusted. 
That's how I would do it :) I may do a tutorial on my YouTube channel for something like this.      Basically I would duplicate the layer and remove the faces and then I would replicate the background using content aware, you could add a solid adjustment layer and then put your face into a new layer and adjust the opacity of the solid colour which could in theory match the org faces...      I would copy the layer remove the person and using content aware fully replicate the background and then using the pen tool or
Quick selection I would copy the person out and paste them into the corrected layer.      Use the marquee tool and select her face, copy this and paste into a new layer and then you can mess with all the adjustment options in the pasted layer.

Was a brilliant Scottish trip :)      When you see a Talkboy and all you can think is room service and being alone at xmas...     Love pictures like this, gets me all castlely.... is castlely a word???      Cats control the world. Like a secretive society. They control everything....      I do see ur point, you would Like to think you were paying to see a factual relic from 1297 and not something they found a couple of hundred years ago and decided it was William Wallaces.. Part of me like to think it's authentic.      The actual sword itself is 1.67m. I visited the Wallace memorial in Scotland just there in March. Couldn't believe they had the actual sword.   The actual sword of William Wallace        The film was very good, but actually seeing the possible sword of William Wallace was brilliant.  Makes you think about history and the lives lost.  Photoshop tutorial - Statue of Liberty manipulation    Photoshop tutorial - Statue of Liberty manipulation       my legs went funny lol     I think I saw you waving when I was there.. the sky was quite clear lol :)      I have some brilliant photos from the top of the monument...      It is class, 4 floors of history :) and the view from the very top, it was amazing although it did make my legs a bit shaky on it!! Lol      Yea we did it right! Was brilliant!       Hi I shared a video here of a slideshow of all the pics on my YouTube channel. 
https://youtu.be/PyYhTMYWjfs     From the size of the sword I'd say 10feet! Lol google says he was 1.95m      How can anyone be cruel to animals! Look after her she's adorable:)      The view from the top was amazing     Hi Guys, 
I've created a photo slideshow for the trip to The Wallace Monument on my YouTube channel.
Hopefully it's ok to post this here

have a look

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyYhTMYWjfs     Will post them when I get to work     Ireland      The view from the top of the monument would be crazy scary if you had a fear of heights, I have a few pics from there, I'll post a link when I get to work      That's what I would do, eradicate hunger and poverty.  In this modern day and age there should be no such thing.      When the makeup overtakes the actual face and when you realise that her farts actually smell, and when you realise that she lies better than she tells the truth....      When your weekend no longer involves going out to party, but instead waking up on a Sunday morning with no hangover and all you think off is cleaning the house and paying bills.    if you could, what would you do to make the world a better place?       It's the Star Gate event horizon.      Flying without wings -  bet they didn't ""see"" that coming!     Where's his parrot???????  Photoshop tutorial - Statue of Liberty manipulation   ",0

Nailed it     Signed it because I drew it, I don't take credit for the original, every artist references work to become better . If there was nothing to reference then textbooks would be razor thing sir/ma'am. Every subreddit people reference work and don't site the origin, I'm not selling or anything like that, I'm  just posting my progress whether reference or not. And I didn't copy completely but why would you care, you're just ignorant and upset at life.      Fuckin bath salts      Cute, nice contrast with the line quality      Cute, love the critters      Nice gesture quality to the waves      How about relax      Faber castell.

I'm understanding the amount of effort you put in to ""suggest"" on something so harmless as a drawing....     Relevant in that your response to a post has been nothing but negative. No critique or approval or anything regarding it. You're just telling me what to do with my life..     Instead of commenting on what the post was you went through my history, screenshotted, posted it back at me, and implied to go elsewhere. Completely nothing to do with the post, feels negative and childish to me....     And I have no issues interacting with great people, just as long as it's not an attack      I was speaking in regards of popladd over here posting my history and saying to go elsewhere. Being ostracized for posting once on a subreddit, is kinda rude. I hear what you're saying though, I never post here more than once a day.

We talk for about half an hour before I need to get to class, and it seems like we're both enjoying each other's company.

I started Mturking this passed August, and I was pulling in about 90-100 each week. I kept hearing how it was supposed to improve once schools got back for the fall semester. Well, were balls deep into September, and it's actually gotten worse for me. Each week I earned less and less, and I was just wondering if it really is going to get better. 

  Did Apple remove the ability to drag and drop music to your device on iTunes?  I haven't been able to do this with all my up to date tech since around the time they launched Apple Music.

It's a real fucking inconvenience too.  [Cringe] Who thought this was a good idea?    Am I shadowbanned?    Is Amazon going to be a part of Force Friday?  [removed]      Structurally, it's decent movie. Characters have arcs, they generally behave realistically, everyone has clearly defined goals. 

I could go on, but you're not going to understand... you've got your fanboy goggles on, not your thinking cap.
     I thought Negan just plain sucked. Dude is way too stupid to be alive.

He's tried to turn Dwight, Daryl, Rick, Sasha, and Eugene to his side, and he outright failed 3 of those times, had a temporary success with Dwight, and the jury is still out on Eugene, but I think it's safe to say he's failure 5. 

Then he has the genius idea to monologue before he tries to kill someone, and they escape.     then i'd have to say they know nothing about movies either     All perfume commercials are terrible, because you can't smell the perfume, so they try to sell you an experience.     lol, you know nothing about movies if you think that     Agreed, MOS and BvS are truly bad movies. Marvel hasn't made anything that bad yet.     Thanks for the heads up!  SHF Anakin Skywalker Released!    SHF Anakin Skywalker Released!       Looks like he's gonna need a hot shower when I get mine. 

It's pretty stupid of the designer to not have made sure that the butterfly joint pegged into the top and bottom of the inner torso.     If DC really wanted to be different from Marvel this is what they should have done. I would have loved it if the DC cinematic universe was modeled after Darwyn Cooke's New Frontier.     and it could still be a total stinker     Not if r/crackiswack can help it!     We can voice that, but we also have to accept people will voice their dislike of our lack of satisfaction with the stuff Gimple's been pumping out.     literally right now     Gimple also wrote Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance, a film where he thought we needed to see Ghost Rider piss fire.     They didn't just drop, they sank like a rock in one season. Ignoring the inflated season premiere, they lost about half of their audience. That is not ""minor erosion,"" that's ""we fucking broke something, and we need to fix it fast.""     We're supposed to decorate those?     They were sunglasses one time!     I wanna see Ass Dan host.     I hope it pops up at tru.com soon.     That explains it. That box seriously looks as deep as a regular 1/6 figure box is tall.     I don't see it lasting more than the initial 13 episodes they typically order. I have a feeling this is gonna lead to another Mulaney situation.     He says the show's ratings suffered ""minor erosion."" 

I didn't know losing about half your audience was considered minor, by any standards.  AMC Networks CEO Dismisses Ratings Concerns About 'Walking Dead'       I was watching Parks and Rec the other day, and the stuff in it seemed so tame compared to Trump's Perpetual Cycle of Scandals.     Holy shit, that box is deep.     Feels like it kinda would fit in between The Resistance and The 2nd Law, because it lyrically has similar themes The Resistance, and the wub wubs of The 2nd Law.     Nice.

#NOICE.     ""business man""     Strangely enough, I can't seem to find that sitcom in his wikipedia page. Maybe I imagined it, or confused it.

EDIT: Found it, it was Guys with Kids. And it starred Anthony Anderson, not Kenan. I'm a racist now. :(     He was on a sitcom a few years ago that got cancelled. He stayed with SNL the whole time too. Keenan is a machine.     clunky segue     It'll be easy to find because it'll be the gilded tombstone.     its gonna get cancelled     RIP Ass Dan     I've been hanging for 5 months and counting! You're probably right!     It's worth something today.     The Trump Administration is about to get fucked by the long arm of the law!     HOLY FUCK.

And here I was thinking today was a little bit tamer than yesterday.     They have Kevin Reilly in charge of TBS and TNT. He's the guy that picked up a slew of great shows across broadcast and cable. He was behind The Shield, The Office, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Fringe, 30 Rock, The Sopranos, Last Man on Earth, and more.     This is what terrifies me now that I've graduated from college. There *has* to be more to life than this.     They can sell the covers songs the contestants sing, and CBS would see none of that money.     fuck i clicked reply instead of edit


basically they'd only be making money off of the ad space they'd be selling. No money from merchandise, syndication, or any other little thing.     reruns and shit     Oh my god, is it finally happening?      Tiya Sircar seems awfully young for him.

EDIT: And then you Google her, and it turns out she's 35.     One day, my children will be getting lectured about this in class, and I'll tell them, I lived under the Trump catastrophe. Then they'll tell me to get into the hover car cuz I'm embarrassing them or something.     I was always going to graduate with a D, cuz I'm a man.     Your post is all fine and dandy, but the problem is the soft minded people you describe *are* watching this show. Just take a look over at the garbage spouted by the_donald. They memed themselves into voting for an idiot.     Junior high? Kids in middle school are getting pregnant on this show? Damn, the life lessons sound crazy hardcore, especially compared to the shit kidcoms have been pumping out lately.     They can fuck off with their ""Both sides are equally bad"" garbage they've been peddling. I'm sure that kind of apathy influenced a lot of people, and led to the shitshow of a Presidency we've got now.

They've lost this viewer for good.     I know this isn't gonna go over well, but I've gotta say it anyway, but I'm a sick of seeing images of swaps on here, because it's always replaced by a shittier figure. 

If someone one day swaps in a rare figure, like a Rhino Ghost Rider, or Hobgoblin Daredevil, then maybe I'll be more interested.     I hope that if it does return, and this isn't some sort of stealth cancellation, they write more action into the series. This season was drastically lacking in that area.     If they're not gonna give the show a good budget, they might as well just cancel it.

I liked Carter just fine, but this season was hampered by the drastically under budgeted feel it had. There were barely any major action set pieces this season. When there were any action scenes, they usually happened right at the end of the hour. The only good action scenes was Carter's brother versus the terrorists, and Carter versus Tony.     Do they talk about how they helped normalize Trump by having him on the show, and then according to Baldwin, attempt to get him to do a cameo this past February?     It could, but I'd take these renderings with a grain of salt. The only thing they've physically got a sample of is the John Lennon head, and the way that's been made, doesn't line up with this skeleton, unless they plan on popping off the head and neck.     This is just a rendering so far, not an actual figure.     I don't think DC movies have been very kid friendly lately, besides Lego Batman, to take the risk on Lego DC Super Heroes. I honestly wonder how well kids are reacting to stuff like BvS and Suicide Squad. I have no doubt that dark and brooding teenagers love them though.     I wouldn't be surprised if Netflix raised it's subscription fee, in fact, I expect it.     Anyone else having trouble logging into thefwoosh forums?     You gotta be jacked if you wanna live long and prosper.     Obviously, they wouldn't happen all the time. They've got all sorts of logistical issues they'd need to work out, and I don't believe that they'd happen frequently either.     I haven't watched the show, because I don't want to spend 30 more  minutes on Trump than I already have to, but based on the commercials that play during the morning blocks of 70s and Sunny, I think that they are giving Trump to much credit by making it seem like he is in on the joke. 

Personally, I think that Baldwins impression is better, because Baldwin plays him as the stupid dumb fuck that Trump really is.     That's some weird looking art.  My denim jeans keep tearing at the crotch.  I've been trying to lose weight since March I think. I've started at 238 lbs at 6 ft tall, and I've been jogging/walking about  3 miles every other day. I weigh myself about once or twice a week, and one time I weighed 231 lbs, then I stepped on again, and I was at 236 lbs, and again at 235 lbs. I keep doing this and now I don't know if I've even lost any weight at all since March. Now I've discovered a tear at the crotch of my pants, and I'm just so fucking bummed, man. I've been wearing a pair of pants for a week because all my other pants don't fit. The 3 that do fit, one had a tear in the crotch, which inspired this weight loss crusade, and now another does too. I'm down to one pair of pants that I can comfortably wear that doesn't have a tear in it. This fucking sucks.     oh yeah, that's a real hilarious joke/s     *of Tony Montana*     He came with PIZZA!     The better hip mobility goes a long way.     It's from 2009 according the SNL Vintage rerun last night.     This is potentially going to be Melissa Villaseor's swan song on the show that never gave her any lines, because she wasn't a part of the interchangeable Alex Moffat/Mikey Day duo.     /#canceljost     Based on the immense lack of screen time, I don't think that Resident SNL Cutie Melissa Villasenor will be return to SNL.      All season!     Holy shit, they're giving Melissa a starring roll in a sketch! It's like her second one!     we need to get rid of Ike Perlmutter     I'm just hoping for some good bass face screen time.  [SPOILERS] 'You're the Worst' Boss and Star Assess Jimmy and Gretchen's Fate       The two feuding brothers from Oasis, and Keith Richards.  How much singing will we get tonight?  Both coast to coast live episodes so far featured a lot of singing sketches, ranging from 70% of the episode to 95%. How much singing will the cast, McCarthy, and Haim have to do tonight?     Considering she was 14 to Rex's 10 actual years, I think she was definitely right.     Just waiting to see what the deal is with New Girl and 24 Legacy at this point. Pretty much everything I watch has been renewed.     Just keep watching; you'll see.     I've only ever heard of one breakage problem with Figuarts.     I doubt he'd ever give an AMA to the website that helped give rise to Trump.     I hope SHF gives this Luke another try, because I just don't see Mark Hamill in there.     Awesome! The Blackish spin-off killed this thing, man!     From what I've seen, which is not much, it looks like they made donny boy way too self aware.

Also, I just don't care too watch a show about him, when there's already so much of him.     Definitely Community season 6. Being on Yahoo made it *way* too self indulgent.      I can't believe they had a song in this too.     Make their mother cry.     Yup, I figured, I just couldn't resist making the Harry Potter reference.      It's Nearly Domeless Artoo!  How long does it take BBTS to get Sh figuarts orders filled?  I PO'd the exclusive Anakin with them, and I hear that it's being released this upcoming week. I was wondering if anybody has had any experience with them.

I'm graduating at the end of the month, and I'm hoping that the figure isn't scheduled to arrive the same day as my ceremony.     If it was cancelled we'd all be going 

Nein Nein! frowny face emoji     That's when he realizes that there's nothing to swing from out here.     The?     Does CNN know WTF doesn't stand for Why The Face?     Was that supposed to be funny?  Is there a dress code for the graduation ceremony, besides the cap and gown?  Wondering if I need to wear something like dress clothes or god forbid, a fucking suit underneath the gown.

EDIT: Thanks for the input, folks!     I notice you have Casual Vacancy, but none of the Cormoran Strike novels JKR wrote as Robert Galbraith.     Kinda on the same page. The Killers have been taking their sweet, sweet time teasing out this album, while Muse just dropped a date for their next single (Dig Down, 5/18)     Did they sing?     Why are all the cool jacked dudes Republicans?     From what I've seen of his Trump impression, he plays it like he's in on the joke, and I think that's giving the real Trump too much credit.     Man of the people, everyone.     Couldn't be happening to a nicer guy.     I know he's guilty of going on more twitter tirades right now...     The news today must be getting to the_donald. I've noticed a higher than usual amount of anti-left articles in the new queue today.     LOL, their ON HOLD function was so good, they applied it to the entire franchise!     ""But I thought build a figure was supposed to prevent this?!""

-Hasbro     I fucking love the prequels.     ""It's probably gonna rain.""


BUT WHEN?!     They're banking on Steve Sansweet buying that.     I'd really appreciate it if you didn't tell me how to live my life.     You can go anywhere on reddit if you wanna circle jerk Rick and Morty. Just talk about Mulan sauce or something, and *burp* you'll find annoying *burp* Rick and *burp* Morty fans.     BOTCHED RELAUNCH! BOTCHED RELAUNCH! 

READ ALL ABOUT IT!     Is he about to jerk off?     It's still doing well for ABC. I was hoping that rising production costs would prevent something like this 2 season renewal, but that we'd still wind up with a final season to send off the Dunphy-Prichetts to the rest of their lives.     I don't think they were working toward anything, but seeing as how the show runners are in the middle of a Feud (Ryan Murphy should adapt this) they don't work on episodes together which is why we get so many scattershot storylines that never seem to amount to being more than a temporary thing.  That's what I mean by wasted potential. 

After this season wraps up, I'm sure this will be the last we ever hear of the parking lot Jay and Phil are working on.     2 more years until that happens...      fuck


2 more years until we get that unsatisfying ending the show will most likely get considering the show runners blew it's potential.     There were a lot of anachronistic things in that show. For instance, Eric sure seemed to know a lot about Star Wars despite there only being one film out at the time of the show, and a Holiday special I guess. A lot of the Star Wars stuff was modern at the time as well.     The D will be fine. ;)     LA is greater than Vegas. Glad we've got that cleared up.      You got a little bit of woman on your boobs there.     #**COCK**     WTF is Batman doing? He can't fly like Superman or sometimes Wonder Woman, and he's not running as fast as Flash. So is he just awkwardly in mid horizontal fall?     The rights to the character are constantly in flux.     These DC movies typically go through 3 directors before one sticks, so once Reeves drops out due to creative differences, we'll get the one that conforms to the studio's shitty vision.     If you get banned from /r/gaming you're doing something right.
     Why'd you tape up the stand?     Better pick these up while the heat is low, cuz the movie is  testing VERY well. http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/guardians-galaxy-vol-2-scores-extremely-rare-100-test-screening-974277  'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2' Scores Extremely Rare 100 in Test Screening (Exclusive)    'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2' Scores Extremely Rare 100 in Test Screening (Exclusive)       Shallow-throating Donny's micro-dick?     I'm amazed this is up on the front page. I posted a clip from last weeks show and I was instantly brigaded by some of the Trumptards on this sub. They really hate ""Nasty Woman"" Sam Bee around these parts.     It's probably just a nod by the Marvel Legends team, and also a marketing tactic, because Iron Man is ""different"" now, so parents won't be able to say their kid already has that Iron Man and Spider-Man from the Civil War Multipack.     It just looks like a repaint of the Mark 46. I don't believe Marvel would do a new armor for  a movie where they won't be able to take full advantage of the design in all merchandise, since they won't be able to sell it without a Spider-Man due to the deal they made.     Guys, this is photoshopped. It's based off a Hasbro Repaint. It won't be in the movie.     Amazon. Never gotten a dud from them. Paint apps have always been good. None have ever broken on me either.",0

https://youtu.be/40j97KX0V6s  A new shampoo brand :P, digital painting, 500MB       you're welcome, though it's rather ""who risks nothing gets nothing""... because it is an investment system that still risks to collapse at any time...lol...but I love my hobby so I decided to risk it and if it doesn't work, I'd just say ""I deserved the exposure"".  Engelsrufer, Digital Painting, 500MB       It was pretty hilarious, I think you summarised things well but you need to be more expressive, need to practice more on how to sound natural :) ...good luck with your channel.  I failed to draw Rihanna but I still drew someone :)    [Video] How to make digital painting with Clip Studio Paint Pro (Basics)       you're welcome :)  Lotus Elf, Digital Painting, 500MB       I don't think there is any specific rules that you should follow...but I think it's better to wait to have more subscribers before inviting people to follow on social medias. I used annotation to tell my views to follow me on my SMs but it was pretty useless. You can always link those media to your channel and the visitor will see the link in the corner of your channel art. It's better to grow social media following separately by being active on them, and then plugging your videos there will give you additional views :)     then you should focus first on how to get more subs then, post video frequently and regularly...share your stuff though social medias (Facebook, google+, ....)...it's difficult to know how you grow if you haven't even started to grow yet...lol  Valentine special Part 2    Special valentine comics part 1       I think the best measure is the number of active subscribers...that is the percentage of video views/likes/comments you get from your subscribers...if people are subscribing but are not watching then that's gonna slow you down instead.     Look at the ""Ad impressions"" and ""Ad clicks"" in your google adsense account, number of views are meaningless if those are small or zero...if you haven't linked and adsense account, this might be the time to do so as it is very informative and that's the only way for you to get money anyways.  Mermaid in the Moonlight, Digital Media, 500MB       You're welcome ^_^ ... you're the one to judge what works the best for you.     yes...and you can have multiple adgroup in one campaign...all of my ads are in-display so I make the cost per clicks really cheap (ex: max 0.05$). It means only people who are really interested click on it and we only pay when they watch at least 30s.      I really can't understand why you making this kind of video...I didn't get or understand any messages you try to convey with it, all I saw was 3D characters punching each other :-/     you mean 30s not 30 minutes ^_^ ... well, your message in the video is pretty clear, good luck with your giveaway.    Midnight Butterflies, Digital Painting, 200MB       well it was kind of funny but your title is a bit misleading...do not start with such a long sentence at the beginning it feels like the video is not narrated...you talk about 18 reasons but I couldn't count them...you should have some counting system such at 1st reason... ,2nd reason..., 3rd...   you are talking too fast and with no breaks couldn't follow anything and you only talk about yourself all the time. You ONLY put the motivation for other people in the end so I think this video is more about how YOU love yourself and not at all telling the other people about why they should love themselves...I understand you are focusing on you to give the example, but it's really misleading...at least state what the people should do first.     It really depends on what you think would be the best and on what is your audience expectation...though it is often advised to have a separate channel for different projects...However, I think if you have your diverse content from the very beginning and build your audience upon that expectation, i.e. expectation of many themes then it should be fine...but if you started out with only ""Topic A"" from the beginning and then switch to/add ""Topic B"" midway, you will make your subscribers re-evaluate the reason they sign up for your channel, it's fine if they like ""Topic B"" but you risk to loose them if they don't like it...so another theme or another topic that they didn't sign up from the beginning is always subjected to re-evaluation...hope this helps     This is Manga Studio 5 or Clip studio Paint pro by Smith Micro :)     OK :) lol     well, that's really pretty :)     My advices would be straight on this issue...DO NOT motivate them!!! ... If you are the only ones doing the work, just walk out of that group, it's not about friendship anymore, you decided to open the channel together, so why would you do all the work while all the others slack off? that's unfair and unhealthy...I would advice to just walk away from that group...opening an account is as simple as having a google mail, so right now that you are still small, I suggest you walk away and create your own, it's together from the beginning or nothing at all...I would be pissed off if I were in that kind of group, I would have left a long long long time ago :) ... hope this helps.     lol...I think your message is for excellentsamuraid, right! you replied to my comment :) but I understand you are on your mobile so it's just an accident. 
Those people who just spend their time spreading negativity must be banned from online, I always say if one can't say something constructive or nice, then one should just not say anything :-/     Wow, that's quite a long post you have there...even though I empathise with your feelings I cannot say I agree with your plans...I think youtube is one of the most stressful and hardest online business, so if your moral is not straight hard rock, you gonna get more depression...you cannot go and market your channel with the mind set that you want some compassion from others, keep working hard on the quality even if you do not have the means, I saw some of your vids and I have to say that you got to shorten them and behave more lively while speaking, if you sound so bored then the the viewers are not gonna give you their time of the day. We all know that we need a certain amount of active subscribers to boost our channel up, now can you imaging 1000 people subscribing just because you want their compassion? that is impossible, you may reach 20 or 50 people but those are not gonna help you if they didn't subscribe out of their own will...Now for the depression part, boosting self confidence and self esteem is what you need...try out some guided meditations, there are many on youtube that helps you to lift your self esteem and confidence. Do some sports, even running in the park can help...you should make and post your videos with the mindset that you ARE already SATISFIED and you do not care about views or subscriptions of whatever, because you enjoyed making the videos...then promote your videos one by one in social networks, there are plenty you can use, but remember there is something called karma...if you do not give feedback to anyone you cannot expect anyone to give you back...it doesn't have to be a one to one exchange, but just the more you give, the more you receive....Hope this helps     Looks delicious :)     I drew Adele in a new pose using 2 reference pictures ... would love some feedbacks :)
https://youtu.be/8lk93bvrgsE     Wonderful art, I love the spiky shape :D     Thanks for sharing :) ...though this kind of thing is really not my cup of tea, just to make sure I don't destroy anything...I always ask somebody else to take care of my hardware materials ... lol ... some closed caption would have been useful though, and maybe next time, you could include some steps into it...something like Step 1 ... , Step 2..., ... it would make your video lighter and more engaging...and then summarise the steps at the end of the video.     :) yes, these are my fanart practices  3rd Art Journey (currently at 6th), Digital Painting, 64.5mMB       nice painting ^_^ ... I enjoyed the process...it was informative, I didn't know there was so much blending techniques involved in oil paintings :)     I think you are doing pretty good so far considering you aren't using any ads but still got so many subscribers in a few month...I don't really have anything to suggest except that you should perhaps take one step back make some deep video assessment and try to understand the reason you got so many subscribers in the first place...perhaps repeating the same process would help you get back on the run :D ... if your channel wasn't appealing enough in the first place, why would all those people subscribe...keep uploading content on a regular basis and do not worry about the views, your best statistics would be when 10% of your subscribers watch your new uploads (according to some advices I found) ... hope this helps.     I sorry but I'm gonna have to disagree with the type of content you are making and monetising...there are more things than music to worry about...for one, you are putting tones of footage cut and pieces from other videos and that's just heading straight to copyright infringement claims...second, you are totally absent, type of videos like that are meant to be narrated and all there is are text for us to read, so it is highly unattractive, mainly because we have to read the long text and follow the video at the same time...I suggest you start narrating your stuff and include closed captions...Hope this helps.     The Video Creators (Tim Shmoyer) explained that no matter the number of subscriber you have, you are not gonna get all of them to watch your new uploads, in fact he said that a statistic of 10% views coming from subscribers is already really good...which means if you have 1K subscribers then 100 views is already really good.
I think changing content type all the time is not a healthy way to grow a channel...but since you decided to settle for animation, I guess you should be fine...and wow, you've been on youtube since 2006, but still haven't reached your goal, I applause your perseverance  ^_^ ...I've been only there for 7 months and already giving myself some ultimatum because it's totally nerve wracking.     either it's an error from youtube or you really just need to wait :D ... wait a a few and see if it gets fixed...sometimes after I upload my vids, the quality is really low, but after a day or two they turn to the good quality I made them...the system processing is a bit lagging.  Halloween candies, digital art, 500MB       Well as you said, it is impossible to please everyone...that's indeed just the game, and we all have to swallow the bitter test :) I guess it would be better if you focus producing content similar to those that gets more views and people like though. But most of all you should also just enjoy doing your stuff so that you do not get disappointed by whatever outcome is.

I often use google Adwords to advertise my stuff, but overall I get a like-dislike ratio of 4:1 on my videos, i.e. I get 1 dislike every time I get 4 likes. There is really nothing I can do about the dislike since I don't know what their really disliked about my vids, but I always enjoy making more and more video and make sure to make the best videos I can.     I always start with the outlines of the face, then the eyebrows - the nose - the lips - the eyes in the end, but I go back and forth and correct as I go ^_^
To cure an art block, you should take a break, do not even force yourself to draw anything, go out often and breath fresh air...wait for the block to go away by itself :)     beautiful 3      So many layers of cosmetics...lol ...it can't possibly be healthy ...  it was funny and engaging, you seem to be comfortable with the camera...I don't really have anything to suggest since it is not my domain but good luck with your channel :)     It sounds good and original, though it's not something I would listen too many times...if possible I'd rather you focus on making the lyrics's pronunciation, it's a bit hard to understand the synthesiser, though I see you already noticed that.     it was really hilarious ... I personally think you should stick with cooking vids and continue putting all your humours there ... lol     Wonderful video, thank you very much for sharing, it was highly informative and very enjoyable at the same time ^_^.     Nice parody :) ... keep up the good work 
     Thank you very much for the feedback. I'll check on video length in the future :) ... and yes selling some tshirt would be great, I'll make sure to do that when I'm more settled on youtube.     Thank you very much :) ...yes, I was far from the mic, in fact I didn't plan on recording my voice in the beginning, but I just suddenly felt like doing it...so I just used my computer mic, but I got a microphone now and I think it should be fine...I'll invest more on the video length in the future.  [Review Video] This is my first tutorial on digital painting so I would like to get some criticism  Hello all,

Here is my first tutorial on digital painting. It targets anyone who is really just starting out digital paintings, so it's a tutorial for super beginners
https://youtu.be/9y2xUqZ2qK8

I decided to add a new type of content to my channel to attract more audience. I was really nervous while recording it and I couldn't get over it so I'm no longer sure about the quality of my voice. The sound might be a bit off because didn't use a microphone, I recorded directly with my computer, though I went to buy a microphone today.
In general I think I did my best with it so I like it anyhow but I still would like other people's opinion. 

Two reviews I did today:
https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubers/comments/41uynf/channel_critique_i_did_a_week_of_daily_videos/
https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubers/comments/41uyak/review_video_the_big_cheat_cookie_challenge/     I think you are doing pretty good with respect to the number of views you got this week...you get hundreds of views with 7 videos in one week instead 1 video in months. I really wish I could do the same, but it's impossible for me. I read somewhere that posting a video as often as possible is one of the key to success...so I think you should just keep this up if you can. I also think the video lengths, the sounds and thumbnails are quite fine.

I'll just spend a bit more time to think more about the short stories to tell if I were you. The thing is for example, you have the video about ""tee"" but it's really just you preparing and drinking your tee...maybe add a bit more to that story, for example ""why you drink tee?"" ""why not coffee?"" or put a small gag in there. I also remarked for your video on hiking that you spend 3/4 of the video inside the car, which is not really what I would call hiking... I would skip that whole car thing and just post shoot from the mountain.

If you keep this up and try out many things, you'll increase your chance to get a viral video and that will be when everything turns into your favour. Hope this helps.     Well, I was rather talking about fictional story that are invented by you...I meant how about you invent fictional stories to narrate on your channel...but I do understand that that's what you wanna focus on, it was just a suggestion.     Do you mean youtube automatically detects the term ""Word War 2"" and decides that it's not eligible for monetisation? what if you try remove it from the title and key words and description, if it is still not eligible after that, the problem is surely something else. But I also suspect youtube checks the content of the audio, in that case try to make another video talking about the ""World War 2"" but replace it with another term. Or maybe it is just that the knowledge of ""World War 2"" is considered as something not to make profit of since any informations about history and the past might have already been published somewhere. So youtube assumes by default that you are not bringing anything new. How about working on FICTIONAL characters and stories instead?      thank you very much for the feedback...I'll check on them :)     I would love to live in there :)     Do not look at the views, look at the ad ""Impression"", you do not get paid per views but ""per ad views""... If you have 500 views but 0 ad impression number then you are not earning anything...and even when you have ad impressions, look at the number of clicks, usually on my account even when there is ad impression the money I get is almost nothing when the number of clicks is 0, and it drastically increases when I get clicks...  I don't really understand how their algorithm work, because the analytic on youtube is different, however the total earning is relatively the same so I don't bother about it.

Hope this helps     thank you very much for the advice :) ... I'll see what I can do about this...the greatest problem when it comes to tutorials is that, there are already so many other youtubers that are doing them so great...I am even still following them...lol     I don't really understand what you mean by fast-paced...it looks like a normal paced video to me...and the cartoons are pretty static...have you ever heard about the channel of ""watchwellcast"", link here https://www.youtube.com/user/watchwellcast

I think you can learn one or two things from them :)     Sorry but the tittle confused me quite a bit...""Never quit"" is a too broad term for the content you are showing on this video...but oh well, great save anyways :)     Hello, so here is my show off of the month, would love to hear some feedbacks about it...it's the second part of my drawing process of a ""Lotus Elf""... feel free to look in my channel if you wanna see the other parts https://youtu.be/KMAWRv4E3Eo
     Thank you very much the the feedback...I'm really glad you liked them :)

lol...actually I only have a very few of these slightly sexually suggestive stuff but SADLY these are the videos that obtain the most clicks and views via Adwords, which I absolutely need in order to get a maximum exposure...I tried to change them but everything collapsed so I'll have to keep them for a while but I'll make sure not to overdo.     Thank you very much for the feedback and the compliment...I'll make sure to elaborate on these points :)  [Channel Critique] Tell me what you think about my channel  Hello guys,

I've been regularly posting video for around 5 months. It's basically an art channel picturing the evolution of my artwork and at some point I hope to be able to give some tutorials.

I'm just wondering what you think about it and if you could give some advise for improvement.
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTXfr3wxAMV5TezyqYP7INg
Most of my views so far comes from advertisements I bought via google Adwords because I just decided to invest money in it...

Here are two reviews I did
https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubers/comments/40ecx3/review_video_just_starting_and_would_love_some/
https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubers/comments/40h33z/review_video_raynjay_gaming_first_video/

     I think you are pretty good so far...you are comfortable with the camera and your voice is pretty organic...keep up the good work :)     Alright, I like your channel, not really my stuff of interest but your videos are pretty cool (watched some). Here is my channel

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTXfr3wxAMV5TezyqYP7INg

Send me a private message there if you want me to draw your cartoon character...you should also send me an example of what you are looking for thought otherwise it will just look like those in the video bellow

https://youtu.be/l-m_ioqYm9k

It's for free but I'll have a couple of conditions that I prefer discussing on youtube private message.

     You'll save play time if you do not list these ingredients in your video...I think you should just put all the ingredients together in a single short shot and go directly into the cooking...the ingredients can be written in the description and lead your views to read the description      That was cute, thanks for sharing :)

     That's why I hate putting words into my videos, I prefer using youtube annotations...but then again annotations are not that appealing :) ... well you are welcome, hard work pay off one says and good luck for your challenge of 1 videos a week ;)     they fit perfectly with each other...as an artist, I could say it's really inspiring :)     What is your channel about? Could you link it here?     I think the quality is good and the graphic is awesome too...but you should relax a bit more while speaking do not end up sounding like a robot :)     That's some really cute game ... it reminds me of angry birds...

The video graphic looks good and I think it is OK to be goofy and laugh around it make it look real, just be yourself.

One thing I can say though is that the voice of your girlfriend is much lauder than yours, maybe it's a mic problem...it kind of break the balance...I think your mic level is good enough.     mmmmhhh...I'm not sure I got what you wanted to say in the video, you say summary of what you did in year 2015 but I don't really get what you mean by these short scenes...did you mean it was what you did in your private life or what you did in your videos? 

Beside that you wrote June 2016 instead of 2015 or am I just seeing wrong...lol     Not really familiar with gaming videos...but I think I could say that your narration sounds good and the video looks good in general...However, I think the video is too long, it's really risky to have it so long because it will impact your watch time, try to do some research on ideal video length, I read somewhere that around 5 min would be the best...though I never could keep mine so short, so I break them down in consistent pieces and try keep each one under 10 min as much as possible. Also try to be a little bit more lively while speaking, if you are too calm like that the whole time, all the more in an action game, you risk to make the viewers loose focus.  
Hope this helped, cheers     I've been using a Huion H610 pro for almost a year now, and it works just fine for me...that tablet is under $100.

The only most tricky and ""must"" part is that one has to meticulously follow the driver installation manual...but I got that really carefully :) ... though there are unboxing tutorials and more reviews online.     of course...that's only natural :)     OK, thank you :)     Hahaha...really hilarious, now I am thinking about responding to spam emails as well when I get bored ... lol      Amazing shots, the music is also really calming...definitely added to my liked videos. Thank you for sharing      So cute...thanks for sharing...I love cats so very much and he is so adorable :3   Listen to your Inner child, O-Tripp, watercolor, 2017    Colourful African Elephant - Speed painting by Fiona-Clarke.com    White tiger, Yakovlev-vad, Digital, 2017    A moment in spring, luo-chan, watercolor-acrylics, 15192070    My Fanart of Leo (by Sakimichan) [OC] Final process video       Finished another fanart drawing challenge of Sakimichan's art, this time I didn't bother changing the pose but simply tried to reproduce the drawing directly.

Today is sunday, I am now about to go to church ... but your action is really infuriating me at this very instant ... what multiple post have I made? they are all from different Artists, they are not my work ... I understand you removed the over because you don't know what ""traditional medium"" means ... but why do you have to remove my post when then come from different artists? it does not matter, maybe you had a bad week and feel like doing random acts of power, I wish you a nice day :/  It'sa meea, Emerbend, black gouache, 2017       OK then     Hello, thanks for the info, but you know this is the title the artist gave to this work :/   Geomancer, GreenTomberry, Traditional, 2017    Revival, secrets-of-the-pen, Traditional, 2017    Sunset by Jaiiko, 2015    25.06.15, Cora-Tiana, Traditional, 2015    The sacred tree, nary-san, digital, 2017       I enjoy drawing/painting so I do it very regularly, making video is just a bi-product of my activity, since I'm already drawing anyways, all I need is to do is film the process and do some edits...I wanted to make it a viable business so that I can spend more and more time drawing but it seems it is not happening anytime soon, so I just keep my hobby during my free time.  F250407, faboarts, Traditional, 2017       Yes, I think he was searching for the right expression ... we can also see the evolution of his skills.

Once one reaches the top of the mountain, the downward slope is the scariest of all.  This is probably why people constantly need to find new challenges in life and why people get depressed when their life become less comfortable (even just a little).

There is nothing really guaranteed to work so you should just keep on making your videos if you are still up for it yourself and not expect too much engagement in return.  Hunter house, VityaR83, Traditional , 2012    Destruction and clean air, Filipp13, Digital, 2017       thanks for the comment and the info ...

1) You keep your current channel even if you change content: 200views per videos is not that bad, many people would love to have that, let's forget about the subscriber count for now...maybe you could start off building your new content audience from there. You might expect people to leave but you know if you start from zero, it will take a lot more time...

2) You make a new channel but actively advertise it on your old channel. Perhaps some people would like to follow you to your new channel and maybe later all of the inactive people will notice you. 
  Black Neko,Digital Painting, 300MB       Well, I can see that my subs viewership is poor, but it's not miserable so I haven't lost hope yet. It might still happen, but even if it doesn't happen, I'll just have to continue working harder then.     I think it is OK to use smudge tool to blend, but I'm using Clip studio paint pro so there is a variety of blending tools...I think smudge tool is equivalent to ""blend"".      thank you :)  Survivor, Digital Painting, 200MB       I started to post videos in July 2015 ... I did a lot of promotions paid and unpaid and now I'm at 1K. Currently waiting for some snowball effects :-/      thank you, I really like that method :3
  Demon hunter part 2 [Digital Paiting]    Demon hunter (final process), Digital Painting, 200MB    Happy curl, Digital painting, 7MB       Oh no...no..nono....nope. Nope. No problem :P     I think you need to your parts of that video and not all of it...if you use too much...on the other hand if you are not monetising, I think it could be alright.     My video for this month https://youtu.be/5-v1-ekrHRU     ok     yeah, it also happened to me, but it was fixed after one day...just give it some time it's probably just a delay.  WIP: ""Happy curl""    Happy curl (work in progress)    Halloween Candies, Digital Painting, 200MB       I'd advice to be as organic as possible, and focus more on healthy and/or organic makeups. Health is the most important and where I live for example, people are more and more fond of organic stuff. Maybe you could do some research about the pros and cons of a particular product and discuss the risk associated...but of course you'll also have to demonstrate a strong knowledge on how to use makeups ;)     of course it's nice to get more subscriber, everyone would like that :D ... but I'm only talking about what should be in priority (which is to enjoy yourself), otherwise it wouldn't make sense anymore to post videos :)     I'd say that I really wish I had this 10% viewership ... mine is much lower...and yes as the others said, being subscribed to a channel doesn't mean one is gonna watch every single videos :) ... the only thing to do is try hard to make more and more interesting/appealing content.     this is really pleasing to look at 3     I think the most important thing is to enjoy yourself and to make something you really really like...the result is often good when you do it ",0

Star Trek: Discovery First-Look Trailer Analysis With Screencaps And GIFs         But with the White House in crisis mode, and Fox sometimes downplaying the seriousness of the situation, channel surfers are opting for MSNBC and CNN instead. So far this week, Fox has ranked No. 3 in prime time behind both CNN and MSNBC, which almost never happens.


 On Monday night, after the Washington Post broke the news that Trump shared highly classified information with Russian officials, MSNBC was No. 1 with an average of 662,000 ""demo"" viewers during prime time. CNN averaged 608,000 and Fox averaged 499,000. 

  On Tuesday night, after The New York Times reported the allegation that Trump asked Comey to end the FBI investigation into former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, CNN was No. 1 with an average of 719,000 ""demo"" viewers in prime time. MSNBC averaged 650,000 and Fox averaged 539,000.

Well, we will find out very soon.      Just a small clip according to [ CBS CEO Leslie Moonves](http://trekmovie.com/2017/05/17/breaking-first-image-from-star-trek-discovery/):


 you will see the first clip of Star Trek today. So we are ready to show you something. Its a small clip, but I think it is really impressive and we are really proud of it.     Fuck McCain.   Secretary of State Rex Tillerson: 'I would have no way to know' if Russians bugged the Oval Office during President Trump's meeting with Russia's foreign minister and ambassador last week.       What a whiny little bitch.   Who Can Really Impeach President Trump? Fox News       Fox News is a clear and present danger to the Republic. As long as they keep misleading the GOP base about basic facts, we will not see any meaningful actions from the Republican Congress.       So by prequel they actually meant that it took place a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.     So by prequel they actually meant that it took place a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.  'Star Trek: Discovery' Reveals First Photo of Two Cast Members        What last weeks Oval Office lovefest with the Russians demonstrated was that the adults are not, in fact, in charge: a 70-year-old man-baby named Donald Trump is. There are just too many ways in which the presidentany president, but especially this oneis beyond the restraints of those who serve him.  The Grownups Wont Save Us From Trump       I'm sorry but he literally wrote a book about speaking truth to power and yet he lied to the American people.      He has lost all credibility with his ""I was in the room. It didn't happen."" bullshit statement yesterday and the performance at the WH press briefing today. 


Edit: Politico review of H.R. McMaster's book 'Dereliction of Duty'


 McMaster's takeaways: **Don't lie, don't blame the media, don't rely on an inner circle**


 Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, the president's new national security adviser, knows a thing or two about standing up to the commander in chief and his political confidantes  and the potentially disastrous consequences when you don't. He literally wrote the book on it. 

 ""**The president was lying, and he expected the Chiefs to lie as well or, at least, to withhold the whole truth,**"" McMaster wrote in the epilogue of ""Dereliction of Duty."" ""**Although the president should not have placed the Chiefs in that position, the flag officers should not have tolerated it when they had.**"" 

 ""The disaster in Vietnam was not the result of impersonal forces but a uniquely human failure, the responsibility for which was shared by President Johnson and his principal military and civilian advisers,"" McMaster wrote.


 ""**The failings were many and reinforcing: arrogance, weakness, lying in pursuit of self-interest, and above all, the abdication of responsibility to the American people.**""      I can tell you I have started shooting and it is absurdly cool. I feel like a five-year-old when I say those known words from the past that you have seen in shows. Anything I tell you would just ruin it for you.


 I think its out in the public domain that it is Star Trek, but not as we know it. Theyve changed a bunch of stuff in it. Its a new and yet familiar experience.  Jason Isaacs: Star Trek: Discovery Is New, Yet Familiar       H. R. McMaster: I was in the room. It didn't happen. LOOOOOOOOOOOOOL     'Frame Of Mind' - season 6 episode 21 or 'The Pegasus' - season 7 episode 12.     Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.     I watched Dershowitz on CNN the past couple hours and while he was freaking out over the potential ISIS attack; he kept downplaying the Russia connections. As well as interrupting other guests to say dumb things like ""Comey affair now in the wastebasket of history""; forget about the RussiaGate and just focus on this one issue! And ranting about leaks from the The Washington Post!!     As the orange buffoon said to his handler, can you believe the world we live in today? Isnt it crazy?     [And yelling at each other!](https://twitter.com/Carrasquillo/status/864262056849092608)

 WH comms staffers just put the TVs on super loud after we could hear yelling coming from room w/ Bannon, Spicer, Sanders      A former senior Defense Department official in the George W. Bush administration emailed, simply, ""WTF!!!!!!!""


 ""If it were anybody but the Russians you'd think it's sort of juvenile, he's trying to impress them...but because it's the Russians, you've gotta wonder, is this a deliverable? Is he reporting to his case officer?"" the same official said in a phone interview.

 This is appalling. If accidental, it would be a firing offense for anyone else. If deliberate, it would be treason.      [The tweet](https://twitter.com/SpeakerRyan/status/751106162574053376):


 Individuals who are ""extremely careless"" with classified information should be denied further access to such info. 

      I get great intel. I have people brief me on great intel every day

What a fucking moron.      Don't think so. According to the original report by [Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lawrence-odonnell-msnbc-future_us_59162d8ce4b00f308cf5534a), ""Four well-placed sources tell HuffPost that MSNBC has not been in contact with ODonnells team of representatives to negotiate a new deal."" So it looks like MSNBC is the one dragging the feet in this matter. 



Then you have [ODonnell tweeting](https://twitter.com/Lawrence/status/863135251530252288) this on Friday:


 Last night @maddow was #1 rated show in all of cable tv, not just cable news. @TheLastWord was #2. Thanks for your support. We need it.     Rubicon.     The forgotten *rich* men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer!     NBC News chairman Andy Lack is an idiot. Lawrence ODonnell's 'The Last Word' is the second-highest rated show on MSNBC and Lack wants to replace ODonnell? Are you kidding me?


Rather than hiring people like Greta Van Susteren, he should bring back Keith Olbermann     Trump keeps breaking all time records bigly!     Yeah, Fox News turned into the official American Pravda.     It was always ridiculous and most recently Fox News turned into the official American Pravda.       Yellowstone is the first scripted drama series greenlighted by Paramount Network, Viacoms new general entertainment network and leading scripted brand, which will replace Spike in early 2018, The 10-episode series is slated to go into production in the fall for premiere on the network in summer 2018.


 The project marks Oscar winner Costners first major return to television in five years following his starring role in History miniseries Hatfield   McCoys, which earned him an Emmy, Golden Globe and SAG award.   Kevin Costner is set as the lead in 'Yellowstone'       But what will happen when Trump replaces Mattis with someone like Flynn?      Okay. Which polls?      ODonnell, who has been appearing on the network since its inception, has hosted his highly rated program since the fall of 2010. The Last Word is the cable networks second-highest rated program, according to Nielsen figures, behind only The Rachel Maddow Show. ODonnell has even been, on some nights, besting Sean Hannitys program on Fox News among viewers ages 18 to 49, the demographic that television advertisers care about the most.

Americans can't assume that the system will work. It will take immense political pressure on legislators in the coming weeks to make certain that our leaders use every mechanism available to discover and prevent abuse of power and to ensure the health of our democracy for future generations.       Dude, your ball is looking at the wrong time! You should have seen naked Orion green girls instead.       Why would anyone believes a pathological liar like Trump? 


Democrats should stop giving him the benefit of the the doubt and act accordingly.        Ted Sullivan is a writer, my bad.

It seems that he has taken on multiple roles. Beside writing, both TrekCore and Trekmovie are describing him as Supervising Producer   mentioned his heavy involvement in producing the second episode of 'Star Trek: Discovery'.       What else did you see in your crystal ball?     Not even close. Anyone waiting on the GOP to act is delusional.

Netflix is currently producing Altered Carbon a new science fiction series set in the *25th century*. A world where humans can store their minds to cortical stacks and regularly updated it via needlecast, then download their minds to new bodies if they can afford it. 


That's just one aspect of that future world that we will see in the upcoming show.     Shut up, Wesley.      And with that I'd just like to add that Mr. Trump has my full support and I will be voting yes on any of his proposals before Congress.

This reminds me, that I've always wondered why they have Braille on drive-thru ATMs.      I found an old 4 GB Micro under my keyboard the other day, and thought ""What the heck am I going to do with this useless piece of crap?""

I can remember when I ""upgraded"" to 3.5"" floppies from 5.25""s.  I thought I had enough storage to last forever, with a whopping 1.44 MB in each one!  Who could use all that space! lol

Now I'd pick my teeth with a 4GB micro and toss it in the trash without thinking twice.  That 4GB micro has the same storage as almost 2.9 THOUSAND 3.5"" floppies.  We're so spoiled these days.  

And just for visualization purposes, a 1 TB SD card has as much space as nearly 3/4 of a million 3.5"" floppies.  
A 3.5"" floppy is 3.3 mm thick.  
If you piled all the 3.5"" floppies on top of each other that equaled the amount of storage in a 1 TB SD card, the pile would be 1.5 miles high.

...When just recently, they pointed the new telescope into a random area of space that they thought were only a few galaxies...and found over a thousand galaxies they didn't know were there previously because they couldn't detect them.

Well, maybe all the ""missing mass"" is just that we don't have sensitive enough equipment to detect it yet, as per the above example.  During lunch, what did one Soldier say to the other Soldier?

My current job, I work for a very large organization that receives emails from people throughout the world, sending us information in various formats.  We get 1000's of emails a day, from people we don't know, and that have attachments and links to download documents, etc.  
So it's almost literally our job to blindly click links and download attachments.

My alcoholic wife was pregnant with our 2nd child.  She continued to drink throughout the pregnancy, heavily.  I couldn't stop her.  I tried social services (CPS), doctors, law enforcement (least helpful), psychiatrists.  
The best I could do was get her into an involuntary psych eval for 72 hours for being a threat to herself (though not the baby).  When she was released, she started up like nothing had happened.  

No charges could be filed against her for child endangerment.  CPS would only act and file charges if the baby was born with impairments that stemmed from Alcohol Fetal Syndrome (AFS).  Law Enforcement could give a shit, because no crime was being committed, nor law being broken.  (It's not illegal to drink while you're pregnant...and there are no laws protecting a fetus from the abuse of a legal substance)

[For those wondering how it turned out]
He was born without any symptoms of AFS, so CPS basically said Oh Well.  It took three years, but I finally got a final protective order for both my kids against her, until the kids' 18th birthday...and I have full custody of them.  We were very lucky that he didn't develop any lasting problems from the 9 months of constant drinking.  She drank to blackout nearly every day of her pregnancy.

I'm on to you OP.     Wow, great response, thank you.

What I am getting from this thread...the legal way to avoid any IRS involvement, would be to draw up a binding document from Mom to Daughter....that Mom is giving Daughter a loan of 50k, and the interest will be xx% (the same interest that Mom is paying on the HELOC), as well as the re-payment terms to mom (which would also match Mom's obligation to the HELOC).  

That way there is documentation that it is not a gift, and in fact a loan...hence no IRS involvement.  

Further...for clarification...if this happens, would Mom still be able to directly pay Daughter's creditors (as part of the loan) and not run into gift limits....or does Mom have to give daughter the 50k up front and let daughter pay off the creditors on her own?     Those are fair responses Grump.  in a normal situation, your reply would be completely accurate.

The reality is much more muddied, however.  Long story short, Jane is an abused spouse that fled from an alcoholic spouse with her children to another town...having to leave her alcoholic spouse in the home that is in both their names on the deed...though the mortgage is in Jane's name only.  Jane is having to pay that mortgage, as well as her current rent, and daily living expenses for her and the children.  Divorcing the spouse would involve alimony, dealing, and having to take on the $100k debt that is in her husbands name.  
This is also why a Home Equity loan by jane is not an option, since her husband wouldn't agree to that whatsoever.
  Having debt paid off by parent-trying to remain legal.  Friend of mine (always the case, eh?), we'll call her Jane.  

Jane is 38 y/o, single, has a $102k/year job, and has $50k in combined debt, spread amongst 4 different credit cards, and 2 other credit accounts with major retailers.  

Jane is paying approx $1,600 in combined payments on this debt every month (more than the minimum), however, Jane recently figured out it will take her approximately 12 years to pay the debt completely off at this rate.

For various reasons, Jane is not able to get a debt consolidation loan.  Unimportant why.

Jane's parent (we'll call her Janice), owns a home and is well off.  Janice gave an offer to Jane out of the blue.
Janice is willing to take a $50k Home Equity Loan out on her home, and pay off all the debt for Jane from that $50k, if Jane just agrees to pay the bill from the $50k loan.

The monthly bill for the (10 year term) loan would be only $580.  So, Jane would go from being $50k in debt, with a $1,600 monthly combined payment..and not being debt free for 12 more years....
...to being debt free (as far as credit score is concerned) and only having a $580 bill and being done in 10 years.

Should I...er, should Jane take Janice up on this offer? 

A few questions! 

-Is there anything inherently illegal about this?

-Does anything need to be reported to the IRS to make sure this is legal?  (i.e. if Jane ""pays"" Janice $580 a month, is that considered a ""gift"" in the eyes of the IRS and need to be reported?)

-If Jane decides to overpay on the loan, and instead ""pays"" Janice the entire $1600 a month that she used to pay, instead of the minimum $580...she will probably be able to pay off the debt in 4 or 5 years, vice 10.  Would a ""payment"" of $1600 a month be IRS reporting territory, even if the above question isn't?

-Some of the credit card bills are more than $10k.  Assuming that Janice doesn't transfer $50k to Jane (since that would definitely require IRS reporting, and hence, taxes on it)...If Janice paid off these credit cards for Jane directly to the credit card company (say, Jane gave Janice her login information)...would THAT constitute having to tell the IRS about it?


Thank you for any insight into this.  Jane realizes that this is a wonderful opportunity that Janice is giving her....and wants to make sure that Janice doesn't get screwed over by accidentally running afoul of the IRS.
     Last summer I went to sleep in my third floor bedroom apartment at about 1 am.  

I was woken by the sound of my front door being caved in by a battering ram. (at about 4:30 am)  Confused, disoriented...thinking I was dreaming.  Two firefighters were at my bedroom door a few moments after the loud bang that woke me...and then I realized I could barely see because there was smoke everywhere.  I crawl-walked out the door with them, joining the crowd outside.  

Someone in the first floor had started a fire while cooking that got out of control and ended up gutting that whole floor.
None of the fire alarms/smoke alarms in the apartment had worked.

Quite disorienting to go from peaceful sleep, to smoke filled chaos-chamber instantly (from my point of view)     god murders ~~hundreds of people in the bible~~ every living Human and creature on Earth except for a few on a boat.     Just take the post down.

https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/09/08/executive-order-establishing-paid-sick-leave-federal-contractors

I'm a Contractor...I work in Washington D.C. for a Federal Agency.  When we looked at our timecards this morning, we noticed that the company has decided to implement the Executive order early...in that we were granted 2.67 hours of sick leave for our most recent 80 hour pay period.
Cool right?

Until we noticed...that we now earned 2.67 LESS hours of the normal Paid Leave we used to get.

So, they just lowered our Earned Paid Leave...in order to Grant us the Sick Leave that the Executive Order requires.

Is this legal!?  

If I left the company and had 100 hours of paid leave earned...the company would pay me the leave they owe me on the way out the door.  
Now, with it being split, if I left the company and had 50 hours of paid leave, and 50 hours of sick leave...they wouldn't reimburse me for the sick leave. Only the paid leave.

So...essentially this Executive Order just made it easier for the company to profit off us by only half our leave being owed if we leave.

The post does have a little factual-ness to it.  I've gotten Halo Top maybe 6 or 7 times total at a store across town, and maybe half of those times, someone was already there with the freezer door open browsing the flavors and checking the nutrition labels.  Their carts were full of meats and cheeses, and I asked if they were on Keto.  Every time, they said yup!  I just said Awesome, and that was it.       Meh, I disagree. 

Trump would have just ran in 2016 on the Democratic ticket, claiming to be a life-long Democrat, and saying his values have always aligned with the Democratic party.  

The only allegiance he holds is to himself.     Not even joking...but if you want to meet fellow Keto'ers, just hang out next to the Halo Top section in the freezer section.  When they go for the Halo Top, you can check out their cart, and 95% of the time, you'll see a cart full of Keto-friendly foods.

Then it's a quick ""Oh, are you on Keto?""  ""Yes!  Yes I am!""

His 17 y/o daughter was 2nd in the class of 286, salutatorian.  She was in numerous after-school curricular activities.  NHS, Band, Debate, etc etc.

Even though she had applied to over 20 scholarships, she received nothing, no scholarships whatsoever.  There were numerous students in her class that received full-ride scholarships from minority-based grants....many of these students were ranked in the 60's through 100's in class rankings, and did not have any extra-curricular activities.  Even more students were given very large one-time scholarships, also minority-based.  Mind you, these were scholarships that his daughter was not eligible to apply to, due to the color of her skin and her ethnicity.  

There were also students that received scholarships from the same ones that she had applied to, but had been rejected from...but the other students had no where near her grades, or her extra-curricular activities.  His daughter of course comes to the only conclusion that she can in that situation...that they received the scholarships over her simply because they were a minority.

When you create a Sims character to play with and it ""falls in love"" with another Sims character, do you really care if your character dies in a house fire?  
You think that you know the Sims character isn't really feeling those feelings....because you are looking at the Sims characters life from your human point of view.  The Sims character is a creation.  It's not ""real""...even if we programmed it TO SIMULATE FALLING IN LOVE and SIMULATE BEING HURT OR DYING.  To us, the human, any tragedy that befalls the Sim isn't ""real"", because the Sim isn't a human.  And, that's the crux of it.  We, humans, can create a most life-like and detailed simulation that mimics and replicates all sorts of feelings or emotions in the simulation...but at the end of the day, we would unplug that without a second thought, because it's NOT human.  

In much the same way, if we are simulated...no matter what feelings, emotions, or whatever, that we might think we feel....we are not insert Programmer here.  It's most likely that they could very well think the same about us...an experiment.  A form of entertainment.  Something else we couldn't even imagine.

I'm not a little guy....currently 39 yo, 6', and 275 lbs.  Most BMR calculators online give me a number closer to 2300 Calories.  

Does anyone have any thoughts on this?  Would a scale actually be able to tell my real BMR like that (maybe it really is low or something), or are they just using a simple formula to give me that BMR?      I wish we were in medieval times sometimes, she needed a good bop to the chin that one.

Ethics are relative.     You are putting the cart before the horse, and ascribing the consciousness and feelings, etc, that we perceive...to be relevant to a Programmer at all.  

It's quite possible that reality is FAR different than what we know, if we are simulated.  Our Programmers quite possibly are gelatinous blobs that we have no way to relate to at all.

If that simulation was more advanced, and those creatures came to the realization that they are simulated...wouldn't those simulated creatures also assume that we were also six legged creatures with their same morals, goals, and motivations?

Thanks so much, oh experienced Taco Bell keto'ers. ;)     This is..seriously...like the 20th, or 25th time, that I've seen this posted.       I've looked for etc everywhere, but they have no content!     Until they don't.

#macabre     Free rollerskates!  I hope they're my size.      I'd never even considered doing something like this, it bleu my mind!     I make separate meals for me and my kids...because I don't think my kids would like to eat Keto Chow every night for dinner.  Haha.  (Nor could I afford them to!)     Best post in the thread.     I certainly wouldn't call 9 net carbs per serving Low-Carb!

I guess some might though.     Yup, the .5g sugar labeling can be used against us too.

Biggest perpetrator?  Tic tacs!
A tic tac is basically pure sugar.  A single tic tac is .5g - .49g of which is sugar.  
So the [standard] container of 40 servings (each tic tac is 1 serving) lists it as having 0 sugar...when in fact, there is 19.6 grams of sugar in the whole package!  Very deceptive.

You have to be wary of things with very small serving sizes.     KCKO!      In the end, the best diet isn't really a diet at all. It's a way of eating you can stick to that will boost your overall health.

This so much!  The whole article tries to get summed up by saying keto is a diet that is just like any other diet, but is restrictive.

To ME, it's a diet (way of life) that is easy, takes very little",0

Have you watched all the seasons ?   Best support gun since the update !  I generally believed the best support gun was the B.A.R storm but after playing a game of operations with a KD of 59/20 I have found the new best one. The Lewis Gun low weight with AA sights, while utilising the bipod effective, is a beast.

It's really accurate at long range and kills quicker than the BAR at close range while being fairly accurate, it's hip Fire ain't bad neither!! the perfect balanced weapon for support !      Brexit in the U.K. (Where I'm from) showed how racist rural areas are. London is like LA, progressive and tolerant. Trump election did a similar thing. It makes you depressed thought I was proud to be British but England let us down. America is too big and too divided to be a singular entity.

I'm not even joking, I a 20 year old student who studies history at uni would make a better government official than these clowns.

I feel Wall Street is the better movie with some really good characters, while The Big Short takes the subject matter and makes you really angry at everyone involved as well as the governments of the world who didn't do much to solve the problem.

So in your opinion which is better as a film and which tackles the issues better?

They were also used for bombing raids (they bombed London) but often had to be so high up they missed a lot of their targets      #justww1things     Yeah that's true but again - micro transactions make them way more money than dlc ever could so in a way the free maps are just to silence any opposition. Like in GTA V - they cancelled single player dlc because of micro transactions but because every update in the game was free you can't complain even if those updates arnt that good      Yeah you can pretty much do that with every pack in the game. They based the whole game around this shitty system just like Halo and Uncharted did before them but they took Even more stuff out to sell it in randomised packs. I've been playing horde and the like and still just have JD, Kait and del!

Job of an editor to correct my mistakes not everyone submits perfect first drafts like you      Michael Moore is the worst case for me. He is absolutely ecstatic about her and wants a 'Women' to be a world leader. Hey buddy in the U.K. We had Thatcher who is nicknamed the Iron Lady for a reason-just because she is a woman doesn't mean she'll be liberal      Okay so I'm my experience a lot of people have hidden behind the fact she is a women to deflect criticism. I am not god, I haven't read every article ever but in my experience I've have seen it.

Most people don't trust Hillary in a poll back in June 66 per cent of her backers said she was untrustworthy. No it's not all but the feeling is she isn't trustworthy 

As with impeachment - Obama didn't have any major scandals - Clinton has two pretty major ones so there is definitely more plausibility she will be impeached 

Donald Trump decides the Republicans greatly. If a republican husk like Paul Ryan or Romney ran today they'd win because the right in country would get behind them. A lot of states that a usually a sure thing for republicans are being contested by Hillary. Trump is also a moron so he scare away a lot - I feel a Kasich would win pretty easily 

She isn't a progressive - Her view on things shift constantly. Take in 08 she ran as a pro-gun anti gay marriage Democrat- changed a lot since then. Again plays into her trustworthiness. Bernie was always consistent. 

Hopefully that clears up a lot of my 'lies' and republican attacks - this article is my opinion - if you want to write one on why she is such a great progressive who will be a great Pres I will be the first to read it       I can see you are just blindly supporting Clinton - nothing to say about Honduras, Iraq, Libya? Nothing to say about the Clinton foundations and ties to Russian Oil ? Anything to say about her support of Goldman Sachs? No because they are all indefensible for a Democrat      That is exactly right! Blind Clinton supporters don't understand that - we have to make her introduce the policies we want not let her pivot right on her own when she wins      Yes and no. Clinton wouldn't offend all of our allies but Trump wouldn't threaten his best buddy Putin   Hillary Clinton is a terrible candidate    Nixon discussing various issues in foreign policy in 1992 - interesting insight and how many of these issues are still relevant. Weird how much Republican intelligence has decline in terms of foreign issues e.g. Donald Trump    Lancers are obsolete  Been a Gears player for many years but for multiplayer I feels Gears 4 is the first one where I feel forced to use the Gnasher. I remember in Gears 3 being able to use the Retro Lancer and in Gears 1 just using the regular old one to great effect. Now I feel like there is no way to use it effectively when everyone is using shotguns. It makes he game worse in my opinion - I don't know if I've have just got worse or need to get used to Gears 4 but just wondering if anyone felt the same?   Platoon vs Full Metal Jacket: which is the better 'Nam flick?  I've recently watched the pair again back to back and have to say Platoon is the more emotional and gripping of the two. Just really shows the hell of War a lot better and the hopelessness of it all. I find Chris to be more emphatic than Joker ever could be. Oliver Stone obviously had the benefit of actually being in Vietnam (I know Kubrick has Michael Herr the war correspondent help him write the screenplay) 

Full Metal Jacket is still great and I appreciate its format (lack of narration just makes it nice and fluid) but it's a bit more out there and stylised. Still a great movie though.

But I find I always die annoying deaths. Feel it gives players the opportunity to sort of do their own thing and not play the objective. I get sniped constantly from the side or the back when I am taking on the objective. Maps like the Suez Canal are the worst for this as it's pretty much an open desert. Anyone else feels this way? In smaller game modes like rush I get a lot less frustrated.   Musical Easter egg!  The song 'White Rabbit' can be heard on the radio in game. It is a song usually associated with going on an acid trip. To avoid major spoilers I won't go into details but one mission requires you to drug some people at a private place.

Feel this new Mario meme needs more appreciation    So I bought the game at launch liked it a lot but kinda became frustrated...   I bought Gears of War 4 and played that for a week (great game). Went back to Mafia and now I'm absolutely loving it. Clearing a district a night has been great and really addicting. They really pick up a lot after the first 3 and the mission are way better aswell as the new weapons from my associates. The gunplay is so fun! 

The game knows when to feed me a great moment to make me play another hour. Like when a sweet song kicks on when you are helping Alvarez or Enzo. Can't wait to play so more just two districts left! 

(Also for Fargo fans anyone else feel like you are playing as Hanzee?)   Injury advice-save me a trip to the doctors !  [removed]  Micro transactions...  I don't inherently hate them in games but GOW4's suck. I know I can unlock them in game but maybe give me a couple more starting characters? Not just three from campaign mode. Not too much to ask   Nice touch the coalition ! (Gears 4)  Gears of War 4 comes with codes for all 4 previous gears games for Xbox one and some cool stickers! Miss when games used to have cool stuff in the cover. Witcher 3's was so great!   Just rewatched Nixon vs Kennedy. Kinsey and Joan-what is going on there!?  They just had a chat when everyone had fallen asleep and their conversation kinda hinted they had something in the past. 'You have a big mouth' 'I do. And I'm not proud of it' - anyone know what exactly happened or speculate that they had some sort of romantic relationship ?   Just overheard an NPC in Mafia 3 when it started raining... 'It's wetter than a cucumber in a convent'     M1a1 (carbine) with the Model 1887 (Terminator gun) are a beast combination!!  Anyone else pair these together ?   Is it wrong to have a different opinion on Luke Cage?  I've posted some negative things about he show in the comments and I'm down voted in droves. What happened to having an opinion? 

My view basically boils down to this - It's okay but really doesn't know what it wants to be. Luke has completely changed from Jessica Jones. He is so cheesy and I'm not a big fan of Coulters acting in this season but thought he was great in JJ. The show doesn't have a proper identity. I'd loved that it didn't refrain from the nitty gritty of Harlem and it felt abit like the wire-(and I loved the soundtrack)-but Luke is such a contrast it was just really jarring. Here is a man who has had a terrible life but his character doesn't reflect it. Matt Murdock and Jessica Jones have much better and more complex personalities that reflect their inner demons. It's just my opinion. I absolutely love everything Marvel Netflix has done prior but just felt Luke Cage himself was poorly written and his relationship with Pop was so forced. You only knew him for 7 months Luke! Cottonmouth and the others had know him for decades!! Get over yourself 

(Waiting for the downvotes)   AC Unity - that opening...  I've just been playing a lot of Syndicate lately and thought about giving unity a second chance. Wow the opening is so amazing. Not in spectacle of anything but it's just feels great I really want a medieval Assassin Creed again  Lydia Fry...  [removed]  Would the USA have benefitted from organically separating itself from Britain ? First as a dominion then as an independent state in the Commonwealth-like Canada.  [removed]  So disappointingly the upcoming Ezio collection doesn't actually remaster the games in the newest addition of the engine-which has me thinking what game would you like a total remaster of?  I would say AC3. I absolutely love the time period and world map. The Frontier section  is amazing and I love all the wild life. Would be great to see it in AC Syndicates engine. The original would be cool too.  Sorry if my MGS1 knowledge is hazy but does Liquid know Snake killed Big Boss? And if so does he hate him from stealing that kill from him?  (Just on a side note wasn't Liquid in Foxhound?)   Favourite piece of Assassins Creed lore?  There is lots of great historical fiction in AC but my favourite has to be the shroud from Syndicate. The fact it's was the cloth Jesus wiped his face in before he was crucified only for the shrouds healing power to bring him back from the dead is really cool! What you favourite ?   Rocket League... Rugby?  This sounds cool but could anyone work out how it would work - I guess kicking it in between the posts could be the goal and just make the ball like the cube one   URGENT HELP NEEDED (Rank wiped)  Soo I've just upgraded my PS4 hard drive from 500gb to 2tb. I've just downloaded rocket league to find my whole rank has been wiped I am now 1 and a rookie. I used to be an expert !!! My online rank is still the same - anyone know how I get it back ? I'm so depressed - all my stats have been wiped aswell   Getting back into older Metal Gears  So I play V regularly but recently been thinking playing about the other games in the series again. Started new games on Guns of the Patriots last night and omg it's so hard to get used to the controls and older engine. Like feels unplayable (I know it isn't) anyone have any tips for me ? Or just that I should keep playing it ?   Jumping back in.  So I recently bought a new hard drive and can finally reinstall the Division. Gunna start playing again with my bro and we have to do the last mission of the game. What changes should I know about and what can I do post game now without he underground dlc? (I last played in earlyMay)  I've bought all the DLC's and played them a ton... still haven't been Lando, Dengar, Bosk , Chewy or Nien Numb... (sorry for my spelling of SW names)    This is Bobby Charlton. Manchester United's all time top goal scorer and England's second (behind Wayne Rooney). How much does he look like Don Draper/John Hamm!?    I hate running... anybody else?  Okay so I started running about 2 years ago, now I do about 10km 4 times a week but I absolutely hate doing it. I mean I like the feeling after of being tired and feeling healthier but hate going. Literally have to drag myself to the gym/park and I get so depressed thinking about having to do another one - I can't be the only one?  How did the (Mammal Pod) know who Venom was?  How did the Boss AI know Venom wasn't Big Boss? It's facial recognition (if it has any) can't be that good can it?

She says something like 'You're not Jack'   Metal Gear Solid and actual history-who knows anything about the era your playing in?  So as a history student and a general history buff I'm usually pretty aware of what's going on in Metal Gear's world in terms of the real world history. Whether it be 1970's Latin America, 1960's Cold War, the Angolan Civil War, the Cyprus dispute, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. I love Metal Gear pays attention to its time periods and teaches me stuff on the occasion. But my question is: how many of you who play understand the context and if not does Metal Gear help you learn it or do you simply not care?   BF1 - heavy tank overpowered?  So after coming of the back of scoring 27-0, 32-2 and 36-1 almost exclusively using a heavy tank I feel it's way too powerful. Maybe it's because it's an open beta and people don't understand how to destroy it and most enemy tanks I'm come across are really bad. What does everyone else think?   Sean Murray - 'aimed to be the next Kojima ended up being the next Molyneux' how valid is this statement?  [removed]  Do you trust Konami US with the series?  I was just thinking about the future of metal gear after survive and if the general audience trust Konami (especially the US branch) to make a true Metal Gear game. They seem to have a good relationship with David Hayter so perhaps we could see a new game set after or before V with him repising his role ? Built on the foundations of V's mechanics. If passionate Metal Gear fans worked on it is Kojima necessary ? I would personally love a new game with the real big boss set after V. Meeting Gray Fox, Sniper Wolf, Naomi etc could also see some cool intersections with ocelot and Eva. Alternatively could see Snake's missions in Vietnam ?   The Boss will - noble goal or unrealistic fantasy?  So I've been thinking of the Boss' will making the world whole, unified etc Now I am just wondering how many of you guys think she was on to something? To me it sounds nice but is wildly unrealistic. We are becoming closer and a world through globalisation and the Internet but nothing could ever unify everyone. Like MGSV sort of shows there is too much hatred, too much thirst for revenge and so many different agendas. Even in the fiction of MGS I don't think her vision could have ever happened and only things like Outer Heaven show a glimpse of what it'd be like   Opinions on how to make running easier  I am 20 year old, 6'2 200Ib, in shape guy. I run 10k 4 times a week but I always have to have breaks at various stages throughout. My legs can't take prolonged running and the most I can usually do without stopping (solely due to my legs hurting) is about 3k and the most I've done is 5k. The actual time I run during the 10k is about 40-45 mins but the breaks I'm forced to take bumps that to about 60. I've recently ordered some shock absorbing insoles to help but does anyone have suggestions on how to lessen the impact on my legs? Eg running technique  Ocelot's Mother-does he or Snake know who it is?  I don't know if it's ever touched on properly but does snake or ocelot know that he is the son of the Boss? I mean with all the information gathering Ocleot does he must know and wouldn't snake see the resemblance? I know snake knows the Boss had a child. Can anyone help me out?   Ciri's Cousin...  [removed]  Next MGS : Vietnam?  [removed]  Metal Gear Solid is a very educational game series !  [removed]      I do it and a lot of the history podcast (history of England and history of China) are just one person - it's hard work. Hardest part for me is trying to talk like there is someone in the room with me-just have to hype yourself up abit haha      Ah okay well, me personally it just got under my skin abit that she was over all the time so that's what your flat mate could be feeling. It's really irrational but I think it's just wanting to be comfortable in your own space and not worrying about making conversation with someone you barely know      He sounds extremely boring if he can spend all that time on Facebook- like video games are fun and can be very mentally stimulating but just being on Facebook!? Wtf! - are you sure there isn't a brain slug attached to his head!? Sounds like a zombie      Last year my flat mates girlfriend was always staying over or just generally at our house. Something about someone being in your personal space all the time can be seriously annoying because me (and your friend) doesn't really know that person and it can make things awkward like showering/cooking/using the bathroom.

However if he isn't actually around that much, and you guys keeps to yourself I don't see the problem     Lol      How...? Because I pointed out that a bandthat swears in nearly all of their songs doesn't get played on the radio a tonne... that's why that song is mainstream 

Edit: okay maybe I seemed like I knew everything I simply meant a lot of their songs would never be played on mainstream radio because of the content-maybe on XFM after 9pm. They have a song called Balaclava which is all about whether it's better to use a condom or not despite the girl you wanting to have sex with telling you you shouldn't...     The only one that seems really odd and manipulative is the one about him threatening to kill himself-the others while annoying just seem like a standard problem      I'm not unfamiliar with dog being used as a term in other countries like England, but it's seems to exist more today in China and yeah I guess you're right with the feral part      Yeah I guess that's true I just found it weird that it seems more mainstream in China - wouldn't really get anyone calling each other dog as insult in England or something      Yeah I know but you don't get many people today using the term is why I thought there may be a link with China's use   Where does the disdain for dogs come from in Chinese culture?  So obviously we all know that the can be eaten in China but after listen to the history of China podcast and reading some Mao Tse-Sung writings/speeches I found it weird how 'dog' is used as an insult a lot more than other cultures. Is there a reason for this? Is there some sort of Chinese myth where a dog has done bad things?      Most Arctic monkeys songs were never on the radio too much swearing etc      I had done three divine beasts! Trust me it's worth getting it and playing portably is great      I'm sure no one knows the most mainstream Eagles and Arctic Monkeys songs...     Tbh if one of my friends started being a dick and ignoring messages maybe I wouldn't care if he stopped coming. People all have their own lives to worry about stop attention seeking and have some fun wth friends      Seems like you have 'Don Draper' syndrome      This relationship, from start to finish, seemed completely toxic. Most healthy relationships don't involve breaking up at any sign of trouble and you guys definitely rushed things with the proposal. You guys both seem quite immature I'd say it's best if you stay separated. First break ups really suck but you'll come out of it a better person      Preach he is a scumbag - right in Activision's pocket      What I would say is first time is always a little awkward, But I at least try it abit more. It is a lot better than any of the other stuff you can do sexually      I bought it on switch but had completed most of the game on Wii U... because of the nature of the game it's actually fun to do the same stuff again even shrines and towers      Well you haven't tried it... so maybe give it a go before you decide it's not for you? Unless you physically couldn't perform you might as well try it      Tbh one kit Kat seems fine and it's mostly just biscuit anyway     This game is impossibly complicated   Workplace doesn't hire liberals because they can't read!       Not a blog...     Because I am typing and it doesn't always pick up on grammar mistakes - do you always read over your texts and comments before you post them? And ah yes that makes sense ruins all legitimacy...     And this is a gaming article and on I have picked up quotes from this sub you virgin      And many use it to say what they really think because they are anonymous-the people I quoted had threads of defending their view point     My point is these men from different countries fought for their respective countries should be recognised in a game which only attempts to reflect the conflict it's in rather than copy it exactly. So when everything else is realistic in some respect (the MP-18 existed) distorting it for a game is fine, but why can't that also be apart of the racial make up of the factions? These wars aren't only fought by white people so if we aren't beholden to total historical accuracy then who cares if their are more blacks running round the battlefield online then there should be ? It's not being inaccurate by including them in the first place (like the MP-18) but the way it used them is - but the game pretty much does that with everything so I don't see the harm      Okay so putting stuff that didn't even exist in World War One is fine but making the faction diverse is too much? Seriously!? So you just want everyone to be white in the game? Colonial war fought across the world in the Middle East and Africa not everyone was white... your the type of alt-righter who gets pissed at stuff like this.      Yeah I address this in the article maybe you should read it before commenting...     Did you even read it...? 

Also there are two white classes in the British faction     I wrote this article for TNS basically debunking the outraged over the depictions of non-white soldiers in Battlefield 1 and linked it to the new outraged at Call of Duty WW2 showing the US Army as institutionally racist.

Being single as a male vs being single as a female.

My sister and I are both in our our 20s.

When people ask me why I'm single I tell them (the truth), that I'm not looking at the moment. This has never been challenged.

When my sister says the same thing, every single time she is told 'have you tried this app', 'oh this website is good', I hear 'x' is single.

It's weird that society won't accept that a women is single by choice but for a man it's completely fine and won't be challenged.     Jokes on them, he now runs facebook.

The trouble here though, is you also have feminists that believe woman  men and they're the ones who screw up the message and have tainted the word 'feminist'. 

Plus as others have said feminism is a terrible word/name; putting gender into a name is why many men associate it with misandry.

At least egalitarian is gender neutral and still promotes equality for all.     If we can skip to emperor Napoleon's ending that would be swell.

Though I guess it helps that Columbus day is also dia de la Hispanidad/raza (for us Latinos) so I guess if you're having a big party anyway, may as well chuck in a marriage in there :D     No Heathrow terminal 4?     Only 30 odd comments but #1, is that a record?     If you miss a run, don't try to catch it up later. Just mark it as a miss and move it, in the grand scheme of things it won't make a difference.

I used to always eat scrambled eggs and toast before a big race. But my long runs were always on saturday mornings, so every Saturday I ate the same eggs and toast (the odd toast/herb tweak here and there but generally the same).

I think it's important to get used to having the same meal before a long run. Quite often on marathon day inexperienced runners will eat a breakfast that they don't normally eat and it can throw their running off.

For hydration, get used to drinking roughly a certain amount of liquid (adjusting for weather) when you train on your long runs. As you have water stands quite often at every mile, a lot of runners get caught up in the moment and guzzle too much water and that really hampers your running. I personally made that mistake when I went from 10ks race (not water required) to my first half marathon.

Music wise I tend to to work out throughout my training what songs motivate me and make a special running playlist with it.
I also helps it keep you on track time wise, so when x plays you know if you're ahead/a lil behind of where you should be.

I also have always had the exact same song (which I can skip to if I'm setting a pb) when I get down to the last 500m so that when I get to 100m the song is peaking and it motivates me to sprint the last 100m, which fyi when your family wants to see a video of you doing the marathon, it always looks cooler when you sprint.

When I did the Berlin marathon as I was the only one full on sprinting the last 100m the announcer/dj actually called out my name and played viva espaa (I'm Spanish). Honestly it was an amazing moment and it looks hella cool on the video.     A spork.     You guys didn't do all that by 12? We must have different educational systems.     The ability to pass every drink/drug test there is.

We're not allowed to drink at work/during work hours (office job, no reason for that rule). We also have a few office cunts that love to get people into trouble.

I'd go out with them for lunch, order a few drinks maybe smoke a joint. Then when they report me I'll claim harrasment when my tests come back clean. :D

     For me it's when I see someone I don't know just having a shitty day and I can see they're about to break and I go over to them and ask it them want to just talk.

Obviously not everyone says yeah but for the ones that do, honestly over the years you wouldn't believe the things people have told me, and I can see just having that one conversation where they just take and step back can just unload makes them feel better.

And knowing that by just listening to them has made them feel a bit better always brightens my day.     I think it's ridiculous that countries sing in English rather than their own language.     How would having sex with the staff help my fear of change?     What an arsehole, should have used the drive thru.     replace meaningful with shit and it still works.     I would like to see what coporation tax should actually have been paid compare to the pitiful 58bn that we got.

I mean Apple already owe Ireland 11bn so it's probably close to 58bn owed here.     When I see a great topic on the front page and know that whatever comment I write, no matter how much thought I've put into it, won't get read because there will be 3000 comments before it :(     Let's be honest once you hit about 12, any maths you learn after that won't be used by 99% of people in everyday life.     I've had this, I felt less pain when I got a metal spike in my leg.     I was found a mistake in our GCSE maths textbook and said so in class. My teacher contacted them and they said they'd give us free GCSE maths books for two editions if we kept our mouths shut.
For my school that meant 720 free books. My maths teacher called me the choosen one after that :D :D :D     Don't worry about it, us Spaniards are just super sexy...and modest
:D      Do you know what an oxymoron is.     My mum was fed up of buying 'expensive' party poppers for new years so one year she bought some really cheap and dangerous looking ones from chinatown.

She wanted me to test one but I didn't want to use them as they looked dangerous, so she had a massive go at me and so I did. It exploded it my hand and gave me 3rd degree burns on the hand (fingers) that was holding it. Still have the scars now and that was a good 15 years ago.

She made me take a week off of school so people wouldn't find out!     My mum does this but with wrapping paper that I wrap her presents in.

She buys really cheap and crap paper when she gives the family gifts and I buy decent one so she saves it and uses it for other gifts (for her friends. My parents aren't even poor.

     I honestly have tried but deep down I know that either I'm hiding an attraction to them or that they are for me.     I had an old boss that used to make us have lunch with him everyday. Dude we need a break away from you!     When a child that isn't yours is massively misbehaving and you tell them off, so that they stop.

9/10 the parent get's annoyed mostly because it implies that they can't control their child.     When a woman says that she's an independent woman. Honestly I just hear narcissistic bitch.

You're suppose to be independent when you're an adult, it's not an achievement.     Netflix, killed Blockbusters.     Do you think ice breakers work or is it better just to say high my name is 'x', you look like you are worth talking to?

I wouldn't feel at all bad for not remembering whether of not you dream of her. It is by no means any sort of reflection of how much you loved your wife

What would you like to talk about? Anything we can help with?     Amazing; as always.     London defo has a few level 40 players.     Talk to the hand.     With all the magic in Game of Thrones how did no-one detect Jon Snow's really parentage :s     Also helps against trenchfoot     You know I never thought about shaving my feet until I starting doing karate (at uni) and a guy said to me 'wow you have hairy feet', I just assumed that was normal until I looked over and saw that everyone else had shaved theirs.

I shaved them a few days later and my housemate said to me wow your feet are looking super clean; she hadn't realised I shaved them so I guess they must have looked super dirty before :O

They do look nice tbf but I wish someone (esp my family) would have mentioned it sooner.     Just all Mediterraneans really (speaking as one).     I always feel sorry for men that haven't mastered the art of stopping a boner from happening. You have to focus but once you've mastered it, it's actually pretty easy to do, you can feel and control the blood flow to stop it happening.

Obviously v helpful in your teens.     Why would you make up such a stat :S, for most of a female's life they are slower.
  
   As men age, the speed of their urine stream declines. In fact, men urinate faster than women up until around the age of 50, and then women urinate faster.

Loads of sources back that up.
     Surely every man has grown up living with a women :/     Fat men get that too don't they :D     This is why I have a fake e-mail with all fake details on it.

My real e-mail is solely for e-mailing friends and family and VERY rarely someone from work.     I turned up for an interview and they asked me why I was 30 minutes late.

I got the interview through an agency (Adecco) and they told me 1345 (in person   e-mail) but it was actually at 1300. I thought I was turning up 15 mins early at 1330.

I was actually at Adecco's office before hand, just to practice the interview questions (technical stuff) and I left there at 1315 as it was a 15 minute walk away. So it was utter bs that they thought my interview was at 1345.

I told them my agency got it wrong but that I did apologise and assured them I'm very punctual.
I did the rest of the interview and tbh I nailed the questions and they said I had the job and would call me later with the proper offer.

When they did call they said that they spoke to Adecco and that they said that I was lying. I did not get the job offer.

I called Adecco and the stupid women just shouted at me that I was wrong, despite me having an email showing I was right. Still angry now, was a great job.     All about those gains.     And the amount of injunctions we have that mean you can go to gaol if you publish the actual truth but the celebrity has a legal injunction which means you can't discuss it on a public forum. Even saying 'x' has an injunction can get you into trouble. It's ridiculous.

And powerhouses like google are in on it and make sure that zero results come back if you type 'x' super injunction.

Imagine if Obama slept with Trump's wife but you could go to gaol if you mentioned it online because Obama has an injunction about the story.

you can run but you can't hide.     The amount of times I've posted a breaking news story on here and then someone posts it 30 minutes later and that trends is just unbelievable.     Current theory is that you can only move between time machines so if you invent one right now you can't go back from 16/10/2016 but you can go forward as much as you like (and return), providing the machine still exists in the future.     Sidenote for Americans: When Brits say 'alright' they're not actually asking you if anything is wrong, it's the same as saying how's your day; they're not actually expecting a proper answer.     As a Spaniard I make the odd mistake now and again when I'm writing in English but it is bizarre when I'll post a serious comment and someone will just insult me because of my spelling and not actually reply properly.     came in for this     I always find it weird that when you ask an honest question on here you get downvoted :/

It doesn't look at all like a snes controller though. Did Xbox copy their design from someone else?

I honestly haven't met a Spaniard who was anti bullfighting (usually it's just foreigners that are). It's bizarre that people don't see it as animal torture/cruelty. You are literally stabbing an animal slowly to death.

The defenders always so but it's part of our culture. So was slavery and child labour but we got rid of that. Not all things about our culture should be kept.

My father when he found out was surprised then said fuck your mother lol

I'm jealous xD 

Congratulations on coming out, now get out there and enjoy some age appropriate cock      Yeah I'd say most of me being ok with it came from her support      I'd just hint that you are leaving to masturbate then      lol I think that's more about who she is than anything      I went through the same thing, it wasn't till I was with a girl that I told I'm bi did I start to accept it. I told her and she kept telling me how hot it was and she encouraged me to try and be with men. I never really realized how much more attracted to men I am than women till after this. I think I find more women attractive than men but when I find a guy attractive it's at a different level. 

Just take your time and discover yourself slowly, it'll all be alright. At the end of the day you are still you.      Next time you're texting him say you're really horny and have to go take care of that. He will probably be flirty back then tell him you two should do it together      Perfect for anal ;)     Right, it's great lol      You look great! Love that cock, get it hard for me some time ;)     I'd fuck you and my bf says he'd like to get fucked by you so you're not bad at all ;)     You look cute, would love to see that cock you're hiding      The winter one with two guys that suck eachother in the back of a truck. The black haired guy is beautiful and if anyone has more vids of him let me know      When looking for porn in my early teen years I found myself looking for porn that had the best looking guys and almost completely ignoring the women. It wasn't until I was sixteen that I started watching the occasional full on gay porn, this didn't become regular for me till eighteen. I tried to come out when I was nineteen but no one believed me so I just kept it pushed away. I'm bi so I decided to just date women for a while. It wasn't until recently at twenty three that I formally came out as bi. I'm dating a guy now that is beyond wonderful so everything worked out     Many, many times ;)     Lol my boyfriend wants me to thank you because your life keeps turning us on xD      Are your brothers bi too?     Also thanks for responding :) 
It turned my boyfriend and I on lol     What happened when you or your brothers brought dates home?     I would be happy to share a bed with you so don't worry about a thing. Ps I think the scar is hot      Yes, get rid of it      I've been curious, do brothers have the same sized dicks?     Go to the closest LGBT community center, they are a thing and are in most mid sized cities      I comment a bit from time to time but prefer to read      Hey is something isn't illegal and doesn't keep you up at night then why not do it?     Condoms and you're golden. Good luck out there. Im bi and will tell you that dating men is a lot easier than women, but you need more for-play before you can stick it in a guy. 
     I'd just scream the I have a dick between my legs bitch, sometimes two! 

Start every conversation that way and then you're golden.      Definitely play a horror movie the first night, you two won't be able to do anything without holding onto each other      I came out a month ago (I'm bi) and I was annoyed that no one saw it coming...like I never really tried to hide it. I had just been in long relationships with women in the past and none of the guys were there long enough for me to tell people about. 
I came out because I matched with a guy on tinder then we started texting/calling/video chatting with each other.  I haven't met him in person yet, he live three hours away, I was busy with school and he is busy with his jobs but we should be meeting next week. 

Well that got off topic....     My go to when asked to talk is to get right up to their ear and whisper 'you don't deserve it'     I was really hoping it'd be similar lol      We've known each other for a while but just started dating two weeks ago, and thanks for the congratulations =)     Looking for top advice then I guess     I was really hoping there was a general playbook lol
Mostly looking for tips for a top.   Help! I'm dating a guy for the first time and would like any and all advice. Thanks reddit!  I'm bi and just started seeing a guy, we are both in our mid twenties. Im looking for any advice you can give me, neither of us are very feminine and we like working out...there are a ton of other similarities too. 

I wanted help with sex advice, I'm not a virgin but I've only been with women, so I'd like some help. 

Also what kind of pet names could I use for him? I really like this guy and wanted to get educated 

Thanks reddit =)     I used to do about the same thing with a friend. If you want to move things forward then start humping him when you wake up, if he freaks out then just say ""sorry dude, just woke up""      Came out as bi to my friends      South Bend Indiana is one of the most gay friendly small cities out there (our mayor is even gay). A nice apartment rents at 700-900 dollars and it's an hour ride by train to Chicago. You should check it out, it really is a lovely place with an active gay community.      I'd say ""hey if you swing my way, wanna swing together?""     Yeah they bought it. I'm bi too but I get excited by almost anything. I thought it would stop in my twenties but it keeps going strong lol
I bring the girls I date home and around my friends so they don't know but I did just come out to one of them      Friend was using my phone and opened my browser. There was some gay porn on there that he immediately showed everyone else. I said ""you never been jerking it and just started clicking 'like videos' until it sends you to some weird shit?""$     I was struggling with my sexuality but after I saw this the struggle is over. God damn you're fine.      Apparently I'm a rare breed, I'm very vocal during sex, but how can you not moan when someone licks behind your ear.      Sorry bro. Most growth happens at 12. Though it won't be fully mature til 16. You might gain an inch yet     Kohls     Looks fake     r/realitydicks     Now turn around...     I was 310lbs at 6'4'' and now I'm at 260 one year later. If you ate looking to lose weight then I suggest myfitnesspal, it is great. I started jump roping, 200 a night then 400, 700, and now I do 1000 the times a week and go to the gym three times. I'd a long road to lose weight, but think about it. You had your whole life to get you this far, what's a couple years to undo the damage.

When it comes to jumping rope the things you need to know is that it hurts, but it doesn't get worse when you do more. When you feel the pain you will need to accept that amount of pain to keep going. The next day your legs will hurt worse than ever before. Take one day off then keep at it.

You might stumble along the way but keep starting again. It's not over until you decide to stop trying.     I too am coming to accept that I'm bi, so nice cock.     Good on you for this     You should try r/gaystoriesgonewild

P.s. looked at your history, nice foreskin     That sounded...real. explains my boner.     It's an old English name.     I have that same blanket, isn't it great.     Try r/ratemycock     Hey this would do better in r/penis or if you want to try it r/normalnudes but that sub is for more full body shots     I was straight till I saw your posts     Yes, now show us your cock already!     This guy is right     Trimming with clippers works wonders     i like it   How much to sell my paintings for?  I'm new to this and people just started asking to buy my work. Need help with the price. https://m.imgur.com/a/ebxpZ     My ex looks like a more attractive version of me. I'm bi and get hit on by both genders a lot, he does too though he's gay. One time he decided to see the what all the fuss was about and slept with a girl. He didn't like it and he's only bottomed since, to my knowledge (haven't spoken With him in a couple months)      Between ten minutes to ten hours honestly. Though I have been dating a guy for a bit over a month now and we haven't fucked yet...it's weird for me lol      There is a trick to the colors. 


Blue: everyday wear 

Green: clubbing or parties 

Brown: weddings and the like 


The best companies only carry those colors and as long as you're paying around fifty for the bottle you're probably getting some good stuff      Disk golf 

Painting 

Gym 

Tennis      As I've been getting healthy I've started getting more attracted to myself so I think it's normal lol     Get a bottle of wine (moscato is a safe delicious wine everyone will love) get Bella Bolle (the best tasting and cheep) pick up sone acrylic paint and brushes from Walmart. Grab a two pack of canvas. Open Netflix and paint along with bob Ross the joy of painting. 

Total cost: about 20-25 dollars      I'm for abortion without limits so I would definitely look down on someone who did this but I will defend their right to do it.      I get hard whenever I find out my partner is hard :)     I'd give you a hug and buy you a drink of this wasn't the internet! 

You are awesome :) 
I admire you for doing this      I'd giggle, if you're cute I'd laugh      Cuddling with a guy and feeling him slowly get hard against you.      The confusion that comes from not knowing if you're attracted to a guy or if you want to look like the guy.      You can only do it on festivus after feats of strength      I'm cute, monogamous and left wing...     I'm really glad you are in a good place now man. I just cried a few tears for him too. Take care of yourself      I am to a very sweet guy that I met six months ago. I'm known to get into relationships for a couple months at a time  then something happens and we break. I met this guy right after one break and I asked him to go to steak and shake with me (I only had $10 on me but I was lonely). It took some convincing but he said yes, we stayed and talked there for sure x maybe even seven hours. Turns out we both have degrees in applied mathematics and there were a lot of other things we had on common too. We went on another date (we were both seeing other people at the same time too) and the second date was fun too. Then the other guy I was seeing wanted to get more serious with me (this guy was drop dead gorgeous) so I asked the first guy what he was interested in and he said that he's about to move away for his phd so nothing serious. I said yes to the other guy. We dated for a couple months and then broke up. The first guy and I remained friends, we hung out and text all the time and somehow while doing this I stopped seeing him as anything other than a close friend. I just don't have the feelings to be with him anymore. It turns out that his dream school (he never thought he'd get in) accepted him. It's only an hour away. So Joe every couple weeks I get a drunk text about how messed up with the perfect guy for him and how no one is ever going to compare. I feel bad about this but the feelings just aren't there for me.  

Now I'm seeing a wonderful guy and we are coming up on three months (I think) and we haven't split yet. My relationship with the guy I'm dating now is different than any other I've had before. This time it really does feel like I'm with an old friend every time I'm with him, I never feel the need to impress him and there aren't any topics that we avoid :)     lol it's all good now      Aww thank you lol

That's the most unique compliment I've ever received :)     You replied in your regular account and not the throw away you posted with      There are really two approaches to this and it depends on what kind of person you are. Method one is for a confident outgoing personality, two is for more reserved. 


1: text him saying you're coming over and will be there in five minutes. Be by his place when you text him. Bring your twos favorite food. Force the conversation to happen. Don't give him enough time to say no. He is confused and you're confused, might as well be confused together. 


2: text him saying you two need to get together and discuss these feelings. Say you don't like what the awkwardness is doing to the relationship and you'll wait until he is ready to talk but you definitely want to talk about it.      If you don't like him just say so. Sounds like he really likes you though      Someone's feelings are going to be hurt here bro. You have to let him know you don't feel the same way      You have to talk with him. Air of grievances. Then decide if you wanna still be his friend      Early in college I dated some people who worked in the admissions office with me. A ton of drama and I wouldn't recommend it     It's my go to pic lol      We have a liquor store that has a beer selection from every state, it's pretty wonderful lol     Aww thank you :) 
We have a vacation together in five weeks, I'm so excited      I had a big easy from Abita and that was some good shit!      I was drinking one of those not your fathers sweet teas. They are amazing! But if you're gonna drink beer then you have got to drink Guinness      Yeah I posted it a while ago lol 

It's my go to pic, here is one with my boy so you know it's me  http://i.imgur.com/PRAduXo.jpg 

Edit: my boy wants me to clarify that he looks much better than that and I'm just shit at taking photos lol     Try r/GaySnapchatimages 

Here we just occasionally post pics of ourselves in the comments...like this lol http://i.imgur.com/rlJOB3n.jpg      I love Pepe's in Frankfort! 
I'm in south bend these days      Growing up in Indiana being gay was considered the worst thing so it became taboo. Taboo turned me on      I was in the same place as you last year friend. 

You are not who your family thinks you are, you are not who your friends think you are, you are under no obligation to be the same person you were five minutes ago. You are loved. There are people who'd give you the shirt off their back, these people are your friends and all they want is for you to be happy. 

Don't run from yourself, embrace your desires. 

     I've hand a few fractures and cracks. I didn't notice a couple of them, sometimes it just feels like a sprain or like a bruise.      You'll find that it's a lot easier to date really hot guys than it is to date really hot girls. 

It looks like you're trying to get us to tell you it's ok for you to go out and cheat on your girlfriend. Cheating isn't cool but it's a personal choice. Just have to decide if you're that kind of guy or not. Once you start cheating though you'll find it's hard to stop, my ex gf cheated on everyone she ever dated after her first time cheating.      I'm sorry anyone would say something like that. You deserve much better than that man :)     Yeah, usually with pizza and talk about going to rallies      I have friends say they love me and call me babe...it's not concrete evidence      Talk to him and tell the truth. You both need to know where the other stands.      I'm bi, a top, with women I'm switch, with men I'm dom. I dont think there is a general statement that can be said about sexuality like you're looking for.      It's only been three months so just try and put the conversation off for now      What super power should you choose?

How many fourth graders could you take in a fight?

Helen Keller or Susan b Anthony?

M Ms or skittles?

Pretend you voted for trump, now defend it. 

What color of car just screams old people? 

Bowling or getting drunk and eating pizza at a bowling alley watching other people bowl? 

If you went back in time and your mother was about to have an abortion so you'd never be born, how would you convince her to keep you in five words. 

Favorite movie from before the 90s      Start going to bars with live music. Everyone becomes friends at those. 

Ask your old friends if they know any gay people. Everyone of my friends have tried to introduce me to their gay friends.      Somewhere around Chicago but not in Chicago. I live in south bend Indiana and my family is from Chicago. City life is great there and there are a ton of jobs everywhere out here. I'd definitely not live in the city though. I drive or take the train into town whenever I want to and I don't have to pay crazy city life costs. Plus Illinois is in major debt so it's not fun to live there. I like south bend. It is the most gay friendly city in Indiana with a gay mayor who was just running for dnc chair. We have a bunch of colleges, like Norte dame, and there is some fun to have in town. I road trip every weekend to Michigan or Illinois and we have Lake Michigan so there are some nice beaches.      In my experience the LGBT straight alliance was full of really far left minded people who couldn't shut up about politics. 

That being said, some of my closest friends in college regularly went to those meetings. I got along with everyone there individually but when they are together they start playing off eachothers energy and then we don't get along. 
     Say something like ""he was really nice but I'm sure your next guy will be a bit easier on the eyes."" 

Every time you refer to Patrick compare him to Matt's future partner.      She's a pistol      Free concert tickets to almost any performance, my sister's best friend owns a well known concert review site. I've taken advantage of this a few times     Wtf just because your taste in bi guys cheats doesn't mean we all do      What the hell!? I'm bi and I've never cheated....wtf      What's wrong with being bi?      Really late to the show but you have to know about Hero of Alexandria. 

He was a mathematician and engineer in the first century. He created an early wind turbine and a steam engine in THE FIRST CENTURY!!! Only he didn't see the value in these for anything other than temple artifacts...we could be 17 centuries ahead if he had been less religious.      The same thing happened to me. My best friend even said ""I take it you're playing sone sort of cruel prank because you'd make a disgusting gay man"" he has apologized a ton of times since, he honestly thought I was pulling a prank on him. Still stings a bit though. 

Don't let this get you down. Remember that you are not who you spend time with. Do what makes you happy.      Black suit with white pin stripes.      Last weekend a guy asked me to come over for a date. It was a two hour drive but I said what the hell and went. The date was him, his dog and I walking on the beach and he got my favorite meal from Burger King lol      Fair enough, I have a Midwest voice (not too high, not too deep). I play disk golf, paint, listen to alternative music, my tv shows are the political and superhero ones lol     I went skinny dipping with my high school friends a few time during the summer. It was a little awkward at first but we got over it quick      Im bi but probably a bro...I'm pretty masculine and all though  http://i.imgur.com/JohBblA.jpg    Just broken up with  He blocked me on Facebook, didn't return any of my texts or calls. He didn't say anything. I went to tag him on a post and his page wasn't there. This is how I found out. Still haven't heard from him. I feel like shit. 


What would you do to feel better?


Edit: seriously you guys are amazing. I'm crying right now because you are all so kind. Thank you all so much     Turns me on xD      Cry probably      Daniel Radcliffe      No fap totally works. A old fwb bottom had the same problem. Also don't worry about it, it's not a big issue as long as you're having fun      I've never had a problem with any hair. Don't worry about it      I guess the beard is my trick then lol     Everyone had to start somewhere      You just have to own it

My bf is smaller than me and I love his cock, some hook ups were bigger and I loved those too. 

All guys were/are insecure about dick size so they are nice about it. Plus five is plenty to play with ;)     You really just have to go up to him and ask him out. 

Something like ""wanna get coffee in a gay way?""     Possibly

Here I am as clean shaven as I get lol
 http://i.imgur.com/yGPWiiS.jpg 

Edit: ignore dorky look on my face lol     Just the clothing and beard style age me up I think      Thanks xD

...I totally blushed lol     Squats and sit ups, style the beard. 

That's the trick, I'm only 23. birthday is soon xD      Show her a pic of the kinda guy you want to look like, I'm sure she'll have a few ideas. Plus fashion has a lot to do with how things look together and that crosses over the different styles. 


Good luck, I'm sure you'll look fine ;)     Just remember that people are into all sorts of things. 

Often people aren't into the type they fall into. Someone out there is into you

For example I look like this and am into twinks 

 http://i.imgur.com/fvCdPCs.jpg      So you know how tv shows always have the girl with a stereotypical gay friend. 

What you need is the stereotypical straight girl friend. 

Go to a cute friend and tell her you like guys and need help choosing outfits. I went to a slightly slutty ex gf to help me out (I'm slightly slutty too so no shame lol) 

She should totally be able to help you.      God did I need this thread...thank you     I'm kinda the guy you say you're attracted too and I love twinks. Not just for sex either. 

Don't worry about changing yourself, I have friends built like me who are into twinks too. 


I'm usually really good at writing long motivating advice but I'm so tired lol


So what I have to say pretty much boils down to this: don't change yourself for someone unless they'll change for you too, you will find someone, you will be happy. 


Msg me if you wanna chat more. In the morning I'll be good with advice again lol     The problem with being LGBT is that there is no map to our lives, it's a blessing too but god is it tough. 

Straight is easy, there is a road map on how their lives will go. 

We aren't so lucky. We have to discover it all ourselves and will have to defend our decisions over and over again. 

It's tough but I have faith that you'll overcome everyone's judgement and do what makes you happy.      It's been two years and you are looking for an excuse to not do it.      I have never fought with any of my exes or my current bf and none of those relationships felt fake. 

Don't be afraid that you don't fight, just talk with eachother and try to understand. Don't be afraid if you fight either. Things will work out if you both want them too     I usually just prep all the ingredients for my dinners and breakfasts. I'm going to try this though :)

Thank you      This are shitty right now. The world sucks and it isn't fair, people keep telling you the world gets better but it never does for you. I've been there. 


Life is a really hard fucking thing to do. Everyone is living their happy lives but we go around having to fight and beg just to scrape by. 


What do we get out of it?


We get a story. We are not the people who were handed everything, things always got rougher for you and they never got better. The other people out there don't understand what it's like. They haven't lived the same life as you. 


So why is it you should stick around? 


It's because someday you are going to find someone who is where you are now and it's your job to help them. 


There is no cure, life doesn't get easier. Though you will get better at handling it, sometimes you will be overwhelmed by it but you keep on because how can you let this stop you. Everything that's happened to you before vs what is happening to you now...you can't let this be the thing that takes you out. 


There are people in the world who are going to love you for just being you, your dad was one of them. He will not be the only one. 


You can make it, I believe in you.      Lol I had dental work done and didn't realize pain killers made your eyes red xD 

Here is a sober pic then...no way I was high at Christmas lol http://i.imgur.com/1ZRDe8m.jpg      How will you ever be sure he isn't cheating. How will you know that he didn't just inform you because of the hiv      Hope everything goes well. I'm sending good vibes      Thanks 
This how I look lol http://i.imgur.com/mSTjlm4.jpg      My bf didn't see a doctor after this and he got a massive infection, like bed rest for weeks infection. 

The doctor will give you an exam (finger you) then give you some pills to take and if you don't heal up then the doctor will scope you      Pretend I came up with a clever conversation starter and message me back...we can talk about turtle stuff   How do I keep up with the diet?  I'm 24, 6'4"", 260lbs and bi

I carry my weight really well and people always say I look normal. My bf really likes the way I look now and tells me I don't need to worry about dieting but I want too. 

I've done calorie counting before and have lost a lot of weight that way. I used to be 310lbs but I'm having a hard time getting back on the horse. 

I bought all the stuff to start meal prepping but I still have a hard time not just being a fat ass. 

Any advice at all would be wonderful xD 
     Remember that you've made it this far and have faced worse. Or if this is the worst then pretend you are future you just remembering this happening to you.      I used these (I'm bi)

To girls ""I've decided I'm gay""

To guy ""I've decided I'm straight""     I was slapped and popped a boner      On FaceTime with someone else jerking on the other end      It's when you go to say I love you and instead of anxious you feel relief      Something more creative than this      ...they do?     Things like you make me feel like I can (insert humble brag)     John snow nude     I just want to hold his had as we watch movies. He has been really sick lately and we were afraid for his life for a while. I would just love to sit on the couch watching movies with him not being in pain. I'll make his favorite brownies too.      I was almost in an accident that I would have been at fault for like three hours ago. Other guys breaks were on point. I need to not drive when I'm worked up      Obgyn      My ex's twin brother's cock     My friend loves doing this, everyone in the group has a power he's observed and they all get names. 

Mine is called ""I can do better"" I can complete any task after seeing someone else fail it.      Did you have to work up to this?     Licked my cum off a stuffed bear      I was nicknamed screw driver...because I'm a tool and have a nice dick lol     Fucking a friend so she could loose her V-card     You'll notice when they compliment you, they are actually complimenting themselves.     Plunger in the O.R.      20 nuggets large fry     The first guy I fucked is an actual millionaire. That whole night was weird but it was alright sex.      Layer outside in the cold for hours not talking. It was boring af     I either walk to the bathroom and pee or in the summer I go off the balcony      My time to shine!
I dated a guy that's a twin. He is gay and his brother is straight. My guy ha a tiny dick (like 4in). I am friends with the brothers gf and she showed me a pic of the brothers. His is like 6in or more. They looked a lot alike though and the one I had tasted great xD 
She said the brothers did too ;)     Sorry for your loss. He sounds wonderful      I'd love that thing in my mouth xD      Found out a couple months ago that my best friend was jerking it to me for years...I was not ok with that     South Bend Indiana      So I've battled weight for a long time now. I started loosing after I hit 250 in high school then went down to 200 then back to 280 (6'4"") I went down as far as 220 then got into a relationship and over the course of three years I got up to my max at 310. I am down at 255 and it's still coming off. Being this big for so long and continually going up and down gives you absolutely no idea of your true body image. In the mirror I still see the 310lb man who hadn't touched a weight set in years, even though everyone I know comments about how handsome I look or how I look a normal weight. I go to the gym and get hit on and it feels great but then I look at the wall of mirrors and see an ugly fat ass that can't get his shit together. 

This is the problem with weight loss, it's in your head as much as your body. All of the times I lost weight before this I was using fad diets and speciality weight loss exercises. This time something is different. I looked not at my weight but my life and decided that I wanted to be a person who eats real food for meals, whose average meal was hone cooked and could come from a garden. This isn't a diet with an end in mind like the others, it's a new life path. 

I'm not sure how much I helped...if any, but I wanted you to get an idea from someone who has been where he has been. 

Bf thought I should include a current pic to show you what I still think of as an ugly fat me 
 http://i.imgur.com/lfXq57N.jpg       Love the tan lines xD      I'd have to see you without any to be sure ;)     I could blow you while you play too ;)     How about without any on and riding my cock      That's how it starts lol

I've always gotten hard easy so I'd mess with friends and I found I enjoy it. Plus guy ass is great xD      Thanks xD      That's how I started and now I suck cock with the best of them      Love to clean that for ya     Totally sending you good vibes through this cannon ball, don't have a crystal one lol http://i.imgur.com/zCtPLeu.jpg      You look great, love your butt :)     Stretch with their arms over their head lifting the shirt just enough for me to see their little belly xD      This is amazing xD 

You two are great      Dozens!      Thanks :)

I was just dumped a couple days ago but this totally made my day xD      Tinder mostly      I'll volunteer for the sex video ;)     Better now ;)     Bi geek here  http://i.imgur.com/L9eKcoj.jpg      Thanks xD      If you want to feel loved then go on tinder and push the age bar to the max     This!     I tried picturing my self walking in and out of a job I could get with each choice every day. I went with the one I liked the most      It's my mother who loves trump and I go over to her house with printed out sources lol     I'm a huge geek. Not sure if I look like one lol http://i.imgur.com/Q5zkTCe.jpg      There was is something about French men...and definitely mixed Mexicans xD      I think being trans is weird, the same way I think people eating grilled cheese with catchup are weird. 


I have nothing against them, I just wouldn't do it.      Had this problem with my ex at first. Tossing salad was our key to success      He did a shitty thing but that was six years ago...I don't stand by everything I did six hours ago. I think you should try and get over it. He was young and confused, what he did was wrong and dumb      Hell im in 
 http://i.imgur.com/JOwXw0E.jpg      ...doable      I'm 23

Minimum 19

Maximum 35     Bring up the problem with him at night      Then a chili five way it is lol     I used to get rid of my hair beginning I embraced it. The trick is nair      Lol what would that sex act entail      That totally ruined my dream to move west      I think I'm just the normal amount of nuts...     I'm bi and sometimes I'm in the mood for men and other times I want women. That might be the case for you.      Well last year I was broken up with the day before Valentine's Day and this year I was broken up with yesterday. 

I ate a whole pizza by myself last year, this year I think I'm going to get a friend to eat the box of chocolates I already bought with me.      Check in on all the people who aren't part of my life anymore      Yeah, I really want to know why. 

I totally didn't think he was the type to ghost :(

Thank you though :)     Worrying is what we all do when things like this happen. If you topped you have almost no chance of getting it, if you bottomed the chance is still pretty low. Just be safe and get tested in a few months.

Politely she declines and rolls over to the window to catch a few winks. The lawyer persists and explains that the game is easy and a lot of fun. 
He explains, ""I ask you a question, and if you don't know the answer, you pay me $5.00, and vise versa."" 
Again, she declines and tries to get some sleep. The lawyer, now agitated, says, ""Okay, if you don't know the answer you pay me $5.00, and if I don't know the answer, I will pay you $500.00."" This catches the blonde's attention and, figuring there will be no end to this torment unless she plays, agrees to the game. 
The lawyer asks the first question. ""What's the distance from the earth to the moon?"" The blonde doesn't say a word, reaches into her purse, pulls out a $5.00 bill and hands it to the lawyer. 
""Okay,"" says the lawyer,"" your turn."" She asks the lawyer, ""What goes up a hill with three legs and comes down with four legs?"" The lawyer, puzzled, takes out his laptop computer and searches all his references. No answer. Frustrated, he sends e-mails to all his friends and coworkers, to no avail. After an hour, he wakes the blonde and hands her $500.00. 
The blonde says, ""Thank you,"" puts her head on the pillow and goes back to sleep. 
The lawyer, who is more than a little miffed, wakes the blonde and asks, ""Well, what's the answer?"" Without a word, the blonde reaches into her purse, hands the lawyer $5.00, and goes back to sleep.  Today I learned that Stephen King's 'It' clown appears every 27 years.

When the time came to leave, his car wouldn't start, and it was too late to call the local service station.  
The husband urged Charlie to stay over. There was no spare bed in the house; there wasn't even a sofa. 
So Charlie would have to sleep with the husband and wife. 
No sooner had the husband fallen asleep when the wife taped Charlie on the shoulder and motioned for him to come over to her. 
""I couldn't do that,"" he whispered. 
""Your husband is my best friend!"" 
""Listen, sugar,"" she whispered back, ""there ain't nothing in the whole wide world could wake hime up now."" 
""I can't believe that,"" 
Charlie said. 
""Certainly if I get on top of you and screw you, he'll wake up won't he? 
""Sugar, he certainly won't. If you don't believe me, 
pluck a hair out of his asshole and see if that wakes him."" 
Charlie did just that. 
He was amazed when the husband remained asleep. 
So he climbed over to the wife's side of the bed and fucked her.
When he finished, he climbed back to his own side. 
It wasn't long before she tapped him on the shoulder and beckoned him over again. 
Again he pulled a hair to determine if his old friend was asleep. 
This went on eight times during the night. Each time Charlie screwed the woman, he first pulled out one of the husband's asshole hairs.
The ninth time he pulled a hair, the husband awoke

Well, on our hike, we came across something so incredibly sad, it put to bed all of my own problems. There, lying on the trail, was a beautiful and majestic Appaloosa stallion lying on the ground. It had obviously been there for some time and was nearing death. Vultures, silhouetted in the crisp blue sky, circled above.

I looked at the horse; he looked at me. We had an understanding. He wanted us to put him out out of his misery. But before I raised my fist, the stallion rested his head, closed his eyes, and whinnied his last.

Somewhat relieved, I told Ted what we must do now: we had to make sure.

My friend was shocked. He looked over his shoulder frantically ""Who,"" he demanded, ""Who should beat this dead horse?""

I looked him in the eye, placed one hand reassuringly upon his shoulder and said:

subject2728,"    Im late as hell, but when i was a kid i lived in a house that had woods right next to them, legit 20 meteres or so from the left side of our house. My brothers and i would often explore it along with our bestfriend who was also our neighbour. Well one day it was me, my older brother, and neighbour. I remember we got some type of lightsaber looking toys and were excited to play with them in the woods. Well were walking when all of a sudden we see a hunter, dressed on old looking hunting gear which seemed extremely odd i forget the weapon he was carrying but we froze and stared at eachother for quite sometime. All of a sudden he started sprinting towards us and we were sprinting the fuck out of there, all i remember is seeing him get stuck in some old rusty animal trap and start yelling in pain. When i returned sometime later the trap was still there extemely rusty. I have no idea what to make of the situation. I know over the years the the memory changed and everything may not be 100% accurate but my brother remembers it as well.

This is pretty good but along with this i was think also a 'war dogs' type of movie set up in that style. That would be fucking cool to see.     That sounds like a good idea to us but think about it they dont give a shit about ps3 servers or games anymore. They didnt care about fixing the hacks a few years back when ps3 was the main gaming system so why would they care about it now when there ps4 servers and games to worry about. Its just not worth it for them. Theres a higher chance that they will remaster mw2 rather than fixing an old game.  Silk road  Is it just me or does anyone else think a movie about the creation of silk road and ross ulbricht would be interesting?     Sadly the only game mode u csn play without it being ruined by hackers is ffa. I still play once in a while for that nostalgic feeling but its not the same. The days where i used to play for hours on end with my friends on the other end of the mic are over, even though i hate to admit it.  This tripped me out considering I have a final tomorrow...       If ur talking about being one of those people who mods in mw2...I hate you     How'd you do that?     Forgot to mention removing painkiller and adding theatre mode     Hopefully take out noob tubes, but keep everything else the same. Can't fuck with a classic. Adding maps is the most I would hope for, but other than that I would be happy to be playing with no hackers     Guaranteed that kids railing his wife     If you want to wait till the weekend I would be down to quickscope what's ur psn?     I would do that but that would mean switching to a completely new system and stuff. Like I'm Reay used to this and don't play enough to do the switch. But honestly I fucking dominate when there's no hackers lol. People think I have aim bot but I don't which is funny haha.
     Wtf lol
     Lol so bad  why hack?  Mw2 hackers on ps3 why do you do it? I get on mw2 about once or twice a week for some nostalgia of the good ol mw2 days but 99% of the games are ruined by hackers (super jump, aim bot etc.). Honestly, this hacking has been going on for a few years and I can't believe it's still going on. This shit actually pisses me off I just want to play mw2 with no hackers. Why do you guys do this shit?     Now people can be alcoholics without the side effects. So, they would have no reason to quit lol.

Thank you      I disagree with you disagreeing if he cant show up in the playoffs we dont want him and hes definitely not worth a max     Good season, weak ass playoffs. Masai has his work cut out for him this off season, i hope he works his magic. Casey, carroll, ppatt and lowry can all eat my dirty ass i hope they all get traded.      Yea i feel this way too we need to get rid of carroll ppatt cojo and lowry. You know make some trades. However i dont think we should let jv go his game is still developing and he can become pretty doninant if he puts on some mass.   It would really suck if your superpower was being able to fly but you're extremely scared of heights.       Oh yea i am no stranger to watching breaking bad in a week     In your opinion who do you think we can acquire? Either by trading or signin a free agent  What's the fastest you have ever binge watched a TV show?       Like i said hes a free agent, once we get rid of ppatt and demarre and possibly even cojo and lowry we could have enough cap space to sign a few players. We also have the option of a sign and trade. Idk, just gonna watch masai work his magic but hopefully he takes a look at snell, he could be a good young replacement who still has time to develop.   Tony snell  Does anyone think tony snell can be a good replacement for a demarre Carroll or ppatt? Hes a free agent this summer and i feel like he proved to be much more efficient and effective than ppatt or Carroll. He did a pretty good job guarding derozan and hit a number of 3s. Hes also pretty young and could be a good replacement for the guys i mentioned. Does anyone else agree with me?

I will take your advice and read into things myself, however i dont think that will change my stance. Also 2% is more than you realize. Not to mention the reason ISIS and other groups like it have been doing what they are doing is mostly because of their religious beliefs. Also, i am one of the last people who believes what they are told, i look at it from all sides before deciding what i believe. Im actually a very logical person.      All i have to say is after you die, there is an eternity of nothingness, i know its very disappointing, i mean i would love to have a life afer death type of thing happen but thats not how it goes. Im sorry. Im not opposed to believing in religion. However i have never seen anything that proves god is real. I will believe if/when I ever see proof, and if that ever happens, i will eat my words and apologize.      To be fair i know all about these people teachings i was forced to go to catholic school all my life, actually, one of my schools was named after one of those people you mentioned. Its not like im completely clueless about all this. Ive been to mass so many times i cant even count, listened to countless prayers, i just dont believe in it and dont think anyone else should. To me, religion is an outdated concept and to see how far we have come and still believe in religion is sad. Not to mention the amount of unecessary wars religion has started.      No, of course its not the first time. Im just tired of seeing so many people brainwashed.      Youre telling me i cant be serious? Buddy, im not the one who believes in God... its like believing in fairytales and myths. YOU cant be fucking serious.     Not really...a vegans beliefs are much more logical than any religious person. I dont wanna expand too much of my energy typing, so go watch a documentary on Netflix called Zeitgeist.     Well, I dont want to shit on religion too much because people will get extremely sensitive. In short, no, i obviously dont.      Im speachless...so you believe in life after death i assume?     You actually believe in god, jesus etc....?     Is this a serious subreddit? I cant believe people believe in this stuff...

People of reddit, how did you cope with the stress of school? [SERIOUS]    How did you learn to tie your shoes?    What is the creepiest website you have stumbled across?       I feel like i would have had a similar experience if i would have made a move. Last year in my senior year of highschool, one of my teachers would always make eye contact with me for long periods of time, especially if i went up to as a question she would hardly listen and just stare at me. She treated me ""better"" than other students, would laugh at my jokes, and would always touch my shoulder. Couple of times she made excuses to see me after class. If i was gone she would repatedly ask students where i was, when i would be back etc. However she was engaged and i was in a relationship so i guess we were both reluctant to make any moves and even though other people noticed it as well, i was very skeptical because i didnt exactly know how to deal with a teacher having a crush on me. However, i do always wonder what could have came out of it if one of us had made a move, and slightly regret not doing so. Wrong place wrong time i guess. Maybe one day i can redeem myself, if not with her than another teacher, probably would have been a great experience.  People of reddit who have had student teacher relations, how did it happen? And was it worth it?    People of reddit, how would you describe reddit to someone who has no idea what it is?    What is one situation you thought you would never get out of, but eneded up working out in the end?       The first one is the picture perfect breakup thats how i wish all breakups ended up sadly its not like that. Second one hurts man, one of my worst fears is my ex will go with someone she formerly said wasnt a problem or one of my friends. Im sorry to hear about your experience man, but if yhats the way she treats you, its best that you just move on and forget about her. You can do better. And it will get better.
  Redditors with a previous SO what was your worst and/or best breakup experience?       Im talking about the first person...EVER to find out. I know they werent stupid, but they had to find out somehow right?

My life dream is not to recieve a pm from you  you are my type jesus!  How did you overcome your procrastination?       I know ive realized this now but the next step is finding the right time to do iy and more importantly how? Ive been with her for almost two years and she was my first, i was not hers. She had a dark past and has some issues that are out of my reach of helping her and they really affect me as well. I just dont know how to bring myself to end it.     We have broken up a couple of times but not a real break up if u get what i saying. But the last one was the most serious, she just said we should break up out of no where she was saying how she doesnt really have feeling for me anymore and she admitted shes very manipulative and can get me to do what she wants. But then the next day she blew up my phone saying she wanted me back and stuff and i took her back.   How do i know if my relationship has run its course?  My gf [F/18] and i [m/18] (were both almost 19) have been dating for almost 2 years now we met in HS and would see eachother everyday and now that we go to different universities we see eachother only maybe once every 1 or 2 weeks. However i feel like at this point we were only staying with eachother because its kind of comfortable and ""routine"". I dont really like this and ive confronted her about it before but she always changes her answer. How do you know if a relationship has run its course and when its time to end it? And how do i end it?

Its really really difficult to do plus classes arent running whenver you want them to theyre only running at certain times, the ones that i am least motivated to show up to are the 3 hour lectures from 3-6 ducming ridiculous.      Ive tried all those methods my dis i terest in the subjecy overpowers my motivation and will to get things done lool. Its extremely hard to keep a schedule when u have different classes at different times. I found it much easier to keep a balanced schedule in highschool, wish i was back, i miss it wayy to much.     I agree they shouls get rid of some old subjects which have no value, or at least add modern courses that teach us the basics of being a fucking adult.     My problem is i have trouble concentrating and end up studying for midterms or doing huge assignments the night before, when i should have started a week ago.     No, and im kind of glad i didnt. That would just increase my stress way too much.     The online thing seems like a good idea in context, but then theres people like me who have to be forced to go to school because they hate it so much. If i did all my classes online, i would have procrastinated so hard i would still be in the 3rd grade...lol     Yes, im hoping i move in with a couple roomates next semester which will at least takenthe stress of commuting off my shoulders. And to take a minimum 3 more years after this seems like forever when your not enjoying yourself, as well as having the question of  ""is this what i wanna do with my life?"" Constantly in your head. All while balancing everything else. Shit gets stressful as hell. Forgot to mention, ive always hated school with a extremely deep passion.  How would you change the education system to make it more efficient and effective?       University right now. Basically everythings stressful, the hour and a half commute, the pointless courses i have no interest in, midterms and exams worth more than half the course.    Which would you like to know most about, know the full capacity of the brain, explore 100% of the ocean, or 100% of space?  [removed]     But if you agree, meet me at blockbuster, were renting rampart, then ramming eachothers farts     Im high as a knife ask me anything. If this gets 1000 uptokes i wont kill myself     How does it feel to make a 30 year old cry?     Not sure if yall commenters are a bunch of circle jerking divas, or if im unversally hated by everyone.      Like the warning that youre entering the wilderness in runescape?      ""Oops sorry seems my outie has slipped into your innie"" 
     Patrick star? You've finally come up from under your rock?     Probably fairly moist of up in there aswell ;).     Goddamnit mom! You lied to me!     Im sorry i assumed the state of your belly button      People are different heights doesnt stop the P from going in the vagee. Its called reverse cow button     Thats just gross lol     Dude, i feel that. There were so many girls in highschool that people said were ugly but they werent. I mean they didnt have the best faces but if you looked past that they had some of the best bodies in the grade. Their loss, more for me.     Californication, thats 70s show, eastbound and down, the supranos, the office.     Ive been to both, and as some of them do get out of hand and dangerous, i feel that it is an important experience.      What does that have to do with anything?     shut the fuck up! shut the fuck up with that!!     Lol wow     I can definitly say that teens are being less social then before. That may be you but i know so many kids who dont even know how to carry a normal conversation. Their vocabulary is so limited to texting terms that its not even fun to talk to them. I mean im not saying all of them obviously, however a significantly larger amount than before.      I have so many but my favorite theiry is the theory that any thing you think can happen, either can hapoen, has happened , or will happen because the universe is infinite. So if you think, man i wish (a certsin person) wasn't alive there actually may br a universe where everything is the same except that perzin was never born, or there may not be.      I never look back!     It is...people become less social. That was your time to meet new friends and to converse with the opposite sex. Who doesnt look forward to a good party in highschool? I mean thats what weekends were all about.      Idk about anyone else but i graduated highschool in 2016, and from my freshman year to senior year the younger kids have changed so much. When i was in gr 9 we had so much respect for the older kids, and looked up to them and i realized as i was becominf a senior the younger kids became more disrespectful. Inalso boticed that they were dumbed down and boring because they were looking st their phones all day. We would throw parties all the time, while the younger kids bsrely threw any at all, i think its from lack of motivation like ""why throw a party when theres social media"". I also noticed the younger the more they used laptops, most of my frade preferred to learn with the old pencial and paper, while the younger generation all used laptops and online learning. Bottom line is im glad i was born in 1998, i mean i wish i was born sooner but at least im not born in the 2000s and im not glued to my fucking phone screen.     Im a good guy greg     Id go dickless for you if i didnt already for a sir michael chick     TIL that im a pimp and a cool!!!!     Well i thinki did ok, i had 3 people on me and got punched by someones dad eneded up breaking my nose. I did ok   If you were placed on top of a 25 foot tall and 10 foot wide cinder block with nothing but a 25 foot rope (with nothing to attatch the rope to) how would you get down?       were beefing!   What is the most memorable dream you have ever had?       Idk man, i saw a video where a crackhead did a backflip of a 2 or 3 story house for $1...landed like a cat too. Crackheads have 9 lives.     On of my favorite stu scenes is when theyre in a room with atticus at a party and stu describes marcy by saying ""shes built for speed, born to fuck"" i died     He was funny as shit. Just the way he talked made me laugh my ass off.  Am i the only one who questioned why the hell runkle had cameras watching him in his private office?    Does anyone else feel that stu beggs got the worst fucking ending? The man was eating dinner with a sex doll, how much lower can u get?       Considering they looked mre like harambe then humans today i dont think they really gave a shit.      I know most people dont know this movie but it was on disney back in the 90s, its called camp nowhere. Apparently, it was jessica albas first film although you dont see much of her. Anyways i watched in when i was in grade 5 back in like 2008 and it just gave me this really good feeling. Going back and watching it today i feel so nostalgic. Great film, childhood dream.
     Is it the kind of baseball college movie recently released? because if it is i think ive watched it it was also pretty decent     Ive had to take long breaks from watching that show, im over a year in and only halfway through the episodes, i love them but the 40 minute episodes 9 seasons and 20 something episodes per season is way too much. One day i will finish.     Thank you some much! You just quoted my favorite movie OF ALL TIME!! dazed and confused...man i cant describe what that movie made me feel the first time i watched it...ive watched it over 10 times over 5 years maybe more. Truly a classic.     Lowkey a good movie haha      Haha ik ironic      If i watched waynes world when i was a kid i defintely wouldnt know what was going on      Armenian power!
     Ah cmon its a classic     Example: your crush talks to you for the first time ever, you just ate a tuna sandwich.      Or the whispering eye     I never understood that reference. Explain?     You dont have to go to bed early to wake up early     The benchwarmers. I always refer back to a certain scene at the end where he says he and his wife ""went all the way"" and are having a baby. One of the cluless guys asks what all the way meant, and some guy whispers it to him, and he had some crazy reaction. I asked my parents and they wouldnt tell me, and a few years later i figured it out for myself haha. Just an example l.  Sometimes, ill watch a movie that i watched when i was younger and realize that i had no idea what the hell was going on when i first saw it  [removed]     Ya i think im gonna end up doing that when it gets out of hand, right now its still ok but in about a year...oh well. Anyways lucky for you it stopped, because now ou are able to have a hair transplant treatment which is what im gonna do when the time comes. Relatively cheap in some countries. My dads friend did it, looks great.     Started losing hair at 16 slowly, im now just turning 19 and lets just say i wish i was 16 again. Its going downhill very fast   If you wake up earlier on weekends then u can sleep in 5 days a week instead of two       Brain fart ;)  If you live to be 70, you will spend 10 years of your life on Monday       You would be able to fine way way more than that, imagine the u discovered life that van only live deep down in the ocran where no amounts of like or oxygen can reach. Some spooky ass shit is definitely down there. Release the cracken motha fucka     The ocean does facinate me, the fact that weve only discovered less than 5% of the ocean is u real. Imagine whats lying at the bottom of the ocean...     You picked the most boring one haha      Hows it different if its directed to a girl? Its just as bad either way.     Lol classic     Scroll down ;)     No yelling in my lobby     If theyre not on the clock theyre old enough for the co....     LOL Wow thats fucking horrible      Hodgetwins?

Dared my friend to climb the roof of a house for a dollar while he was on a bottle of jack and plents of drugs, he did it. He fell off the roof on his ass. Didnt give him the dollar...      Thats definitely the weirdest reason ive ever heard     Lol thats exactly the type of stories i wanted to hear. 
PS you're not real tyler durden      Should've capitalized on those, u never know!     Nono like the first memory you have in your head     Funny that exact aame thing happened to me once except i was around 15. I took a nap in the hotel room, my parents tried everything to wake me up, they shook me and yelled at me but nothing worked. I later woke up at around 7 and was pretty pissed off that my parents didnt wake me up for dinner. I confronted them about it and they told me the story i was like wtf?     Funny how everyone is explaining the moment in there life where all of a sudden they became self aware like they just snapped into it that second and started being able to fully record memorys from there. I think its like that for all of us.  I always see people going up the stairs two at a time, but never anyone going down two at a time.    People of reddit, what is your earliest recorded memory?       What an ungratfeul ass hoe     Is that not invasion of privacy?

Dont have the idea youre gonna marry the other person as soon as you start datin. When you get out of the honeymoon stage you'll understand. Dont ztay in a relationship because youre comfortable, or youre scared of hurting the other person. If all they do is take and never give back l, leave. If theyre manipulative, leave.

Im guessing youre a slow driver...     If your a safe driver theres no harm in it.      30 km/h not mph to clarify and i didnt say i was a reckles driver i said i drive fast, those can be two completely different things. I know slow drivers who drive way more reckless than fast drivers     When people chew their significant other loud?     Chi     I dont like you. My biggest pet peeve is slow drivers.

The guys shvantz gets hard as a rock and the girls whispering eye gets wetter than a waterfall. He then inserts his shlong in the black hold of doom. After a few strokes he releases his white sauce and accidently impregnates her, she yells at him and asks him why the bitch he released his cracken inside of her.

subject2746," Explain Haas ""machine parts"" to me  Gene Haas says he wants to use F1 to promote his machine parts business internationally. What, exactly, is a machine part?

Hopefully she'll learn. :-)     I've had my news preferences set through News app for awhile, but so far Cortana isn't paying attention to them. :-)  How do I tell Cortana not to use Fox news as a source?  I love checking my morning update and reading the news that Cortana provides, but how can I curate her sources?  Bing News allows that, and I'm hoping that Cortana will one day be able to do the same, if she can't already.  TIL that Rosberg and Hamilton live in the same apartment building . . . awkward.    The FIA's titanium skid plates . . .       Exactly. I'd like to see the money a team saves by processing 25 TF of data instead of 30. Can it be that substantial?  F1 n00b's suggestion to the FIA  The FIA should be empowered to make decisions regarding only two things: (1) safety, and (2) scheduling.

If the fans and drivers want different power units, they should have whatever bloody power units they desire, regardless of the decibel level or environmental impact.  If the fans and drivers hate the idea of standing re-starts, then by god, the FIA should not consider standing re-starts.  

I'm fairly new to the sport, but it seems as if the FIA does a lot more tinkering (meddling?) with the regulations than the governing body of any other sport.  

So, FIA, outside of safety issues and the scheduling of events, if the fans, teams, and drivers don't like it, then don't do it.     Thanks for the info!  Where is the NBC Sports F1 studio located?  Do Leigh Diffey and the guys provide commentary remotely, or does their studio set move from one race locale to the next?  I know that Will Buxton is physically on site at each race (I wish I had his job!), but where are the ""play-by-play"" commentators located during the race?      I was paraphrasing Hemingway.

Who is Mike Mearls and how did he get in charge of D D?  From what I can see, Mearls had a few publishing credits during the d20 craze, but otherwise he seems to have come out of nowhere before being hired by WotC to help orchestrate 4E.  I don't exactly have my finger on the pulse of the game anymore, but I would have expected a bigger name to be the lead designer of D D Next, especially considering that 4E was the least successful of the editions.

  Music app suddenly doesn't open. Stuck on ""loading . . .""  I've done a soft reset, but the Music app has developed a weird new problem that I can't correct.

[""The Last of Us"" theme](http://i.imgur.com/7q6nRVH)  Did I explain ""clean air"" correctly?  I'm fairly new to F1, and when a friend asked what it meant to be ""driving in clean air,"" I rattled off an explanation as to what I THINK it means.  In a nutshell:  On straightaways, downforce doesn't matter, and a car can benefit from drafting behind another car.  But on the corners, a car does not want to be behind other cars, because downforce means everything when cornering, and all that ""stirred up"" air plays havoc on those parts of the car designed to maximize downforce.

Is that more or less accurate?     How does a soft reset adjust the battery's charge from 38% to 100%?  The 38% was a false reading, and the reset corrected it?

Is there a ""spending limit"" or ""salary cap"" in F1?

My real-life career requires that I occasionally delve into academic journals, so I am familiar with navigating jargon.  Generally, jargon serves two purposes: (1) it conveys content to those who understand the lexicon; (2) it serves as an artificial divider to keep pesky laypersons at bay.  It's that second function of jargon that causes the lay reader to label researchers as stuffy and arrogant.  In English lit circles it's all particularly annoying, because--as Kuntz's detractors on G+ will attest--sometimes the writer would be better served by using simpler language; clouding the topic with buzzwords and technical terms is often unnecessary.  There are definitely some writers out there who substitute vocabulary for real substance. I'm not saying that Kuntz is one of those types, but the arguments against his cumbersome prose do have some merit.  If only 5% of your readership can understand your thesis, then you've wasted a lot of time.
  Can you suggest a scope mount for my father's Winchester Model 94 .450 Marlin carbine? I know little about guns but would like to purchase the correct mounts (and possibly scope) for my dad. Thanks!  EDIT: Apparently it's a ""Short Rifle"" rather than a carbine.     So far it seems that Kuntz's prose style is being discussed as much as the book's content.      Here are some snippets from a recent exchange from the North Texas RPG Con Facebook group:

Frank Mentzer: The lineage [of D D] as commonly credited seems to be as follows. Does Rob address this sequence?

a. Wesely's Braunstein sent individuals into a castle (modern warfare system), Arneson a player;
b. Arneson then sent individuals into a dungeon (Chainmail combat variant), and told Gary about it in detail;
c. Gygax wrote up and published the combination of ideas.

Tim Kask: Once again, Rob is talking through his hat.

Mentzer: In the [Kuntz book] cover text, the term Dungeons   Dragons is misused and uncredited. He needs a competent editor before he gets a C D from WotC... or maybe they'll just ignore him. We shall see.
     I like the sound of the term ""design workflow,"" but I'm not really sure what it means.     TSR Games.  You know they published about half a dozen issues of GYGAX MAGAZINE?  Eventually Luke Gygax amicably left the company, so they stopped producing the mag and now focus on OSR products.

http://store.tsrgames.com/  The creator of the original Top Secret RPG is soon to launch a new, updated edition.       Well said.  I certainly admire him as a game designer, as ""Mordenkainen's Fantastic Adventure"" remains one of my all-time favorite modules.  As I mentioned, I'm very interested in hearing his thoughts on the evolution of the game we all know and love.     I'm in total agreement with you that Arneson's contributions to the hobby are both very important and quite different than Gary's.  The game would not exist without Arneson.  But reading the blurb on the publisher's site, I get a distinct sense of bias.  Or maybe it's not really bias, but just a desire from the author to elevate Arneson a bit higher up the ladder.  But it may be hard to raise up Arneson without knocking Gary down a bit.  

At any rate, I'm interested in reading the author's discussion of how D D is not descended from Chainmail, since that's counter to every bit of history I've ever read on the subject.  

(It may also be worth mentioning that Kuntz was literally a teenager when he was gaming with EGG and Arneson, and 45 years have passed since then. I wonder how that affects his perception of those long-ago events . . .)     After reading the introduction to this book, I get the feeling that the author is trying to knock EGG off his pedestal.  Right or wrong, there's definitely an agenda here other than exploring Arneson's contributions to D D.     Thanks for the detailed reply!     By not counting D D, I hope to avoid any possibility of edition wars.  : )     What about Runequest 3rd edition?  I own the boxed set, but that is my only experience with RQ.  How do those two versions compare?     "" . . . 5th is just another fantasy heartbreaker.""

In what ways?

     "". . . I stick to more rules light smaller systems . . .""

Such as what?     Why is it bad?     I wonder why the writers would remove the setting's backstory?     Is it?  I own the old books but haven't looked at them in ages.  What's different in the newer version?     Hey, that's cool, me too!  We stick with 3E simply because we have all(?) of the books from 1st, 2nd, and 3rd edition, and the rules changes between those and 4th are too much for an easy conversion.  Not counting D D, what RPGs do you still play in an older, discontinued edition, preferring it above the currently supported edition?       Got it. Thanks!     Okay, thanks!     Okay. I just recoiled when i heard the word "" censored."" It doesn't sound like I'm missing much.     Wow, okay.  Yeah, I don't need that.     Thanks.

My favorite novelist is William Goldman. His thrillers are without equal. He hasn't written any book-length fiction in 30 years. He turns 86 in a few months . . . so I remain hopeful.  [removed]     You have no need to apologize for being too young to appreciate old Craftsman quality. Don't feel bad for assuming new ways are the best ways. Wisdom will come with age. You'll get there, lad!     I'd take OP's old Craftsman against your hip and modern version any day of the week.      ELI5 the many different editions of RuneQuest.     Dewalt, like Craftsman, is owned by Stanley Black   Decker.  Makita is a Japanese company.  There are a lot of interesting dynamics in the tool world, I guess.  Stanley Black   Decker is ""committed to bringing Craftsmans manufacturing back to the United States."" I know that Craftsman has fallen off the BiFL radar in recent years, so maybe the Stanley buyout is good news for the brand . . . ?       Sounds cool. Pics?     Wow.  8000 watts?     Thanks for the helpful commentary!     Ah, okay.  I need to look closer at the specs of the inverters.  Thanks!  My miter saw requires 1800 watts. Will a 2000-watt inverter be sufficient, or does the saw have a ""start-up"" energy requirement beyond 2000 watts?       In those cases, I always blame the song that was playing when the problem occurred. I really do. ""Damn you, Billy Idol!""     Exactly! Upvote.   Is Craftsman no longer considered ""buy it for life""?  [removed]     Um, can you explain what all that means? I am a rotten photographer in need of schooling.     Do please enjoy this upvote.     You fix this by ignoring those ""beautiful sentences"" when you sit down to write.  Just put your character in motion; that's why we read, to fall in lust or love with your characters, or to hate them, or just to see them move across a ballroom floor.  But move they must.  All of the lovely phrases will come on their own time, in a natural way.  Or they won't.  Sometimes movement is enough to carry a story.  In the words of William Goldman, ""It ain't about inspiration.  It's about going into a room alone and doing it.""     You have a complicated username, but I agree with you nonetheless.       Why wouldn't he? He has a history of tweeting things to build anticipation as a release date draws near. Seems like all the vitriol inspired by the renders would elicit a response.  Has Joe B. even hinted that these recent renders are accurate?  Like most of you, I'm underwhelmed by the possible outward appearance of the two new Lumias. I'm hoping the renders represent old prototypes. Any clues either way from the Man himself?     I want a Surface phone that looks like my beautiful Zune HD.     My three-year-old 920 looks better than these. Sigh. I will stick with this trusty phone until a nice alternative arrives. Microsoft designers, go home; you're drunk.     I occasionally run a search on my favorite author to see what the world is saying about him.  : )     I just found this post.  I'm late commenting, but anyway . . .

I am an enormous Bradbury devotee.  But I've never agreed with him on this.  Yes, college English teachers do know more than you about writing.  Every year I look at 200 freshmen in my various sections of Comp I, and they can't find their way around a sentence without a map, sextant, and divining rod.  Those are not 200 Bradburys out there.  Those are 200 non-English majors who've been arc-welded to their phones.     Sure, I get that.  I understand the concept of ""movements"" to help us categorize authors and their influences.  But I'm talking about ""style.""  Lovecraft, Ligotti, Matt Cardin, and other writers of weird horror have many things in common when it comes to stylistic choices, tone, adjective use, and narrative voice.  I was just wondering if someone had offered a name for that style.  At any rate, I'll keep reading them.   : )     Same experience here. I still rock my HD on long road trips. Gorgeous design.  Is there a name for the writing style of folks like Lovecraft and Ligotti?  Their works tend to have long, dense paragraphs, full of vivid description.  Their stories are often told in first person, with the narrator making lengthy observations about their environment and their own emotions.  Maybe these are traits common to the horror genre, but is there a name for that style of writing?     I understand the significance of this.      Another Firefly vote!     I fell in love with the story when I was young, and now I teach it to college freshmen. Glorious, indeed.     You just named my favorite Bradbury story of all time.     I'm interested in hearing more about solo war games. Could you point me in the right direction or offer any insight or links?  Thanks!     Cleopatra and the Society of Architects. I truly love this game, but it's not exceptionally rated at BGG.     A DM should be fully prepared. You need to have read the entire module and be comfortable with it. Knowing the end of the adventure might have significant influence on how you adjudicate something in the middle.  FURY ROAD: Where is it placed in the MAD MAX chronology?  Has anyone stated if the film is set in between those of the original trilogy?  Or is it a sequel to those films?     Welcome to the interconnected Marvel Universe. Just wait. Soon they'll embed key plot elements in the commercials.     Watch AGENTS OF SHIELD tonight and find out.     I know only a handful of the bands mentioned so far. I am culturally illiterate. :-(     I believe that Paizo supplied a lot of books for the project, but I'm not sure about the details.

I think that if enough gamers knew about this, that young gamemaster in Uganda would find himself funded for quite some time.  : )     That's awesome.  When I was in junior high, a discovery of RPGs really changed things for me.  I am so happy for the opportunity to help promote such a cool project.     Everyone should support his project, regardless of the edition or game system we prefer:

http://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/the-village-roleplaying-project/  A Young Man's Noble Pathfinder Quest in Uganda       Ha, I came here to say those exact words. I hate seeing Fox News links in my daily feed.     Is ""Sauber"" pronounced SAW-ber or SOW-ber?     We all need to submit Cortana feedback on this issue.     I'm no workplace psychologist, but I'm not sure a desire to win can overcome the negative context of this relationship. But I hope for the best. I would love to see them succeed.     So a driver is intent on driving for a team that doesn't want him.  Does either party actually expect this arrangement to result in points this weekend? What a disastrous start to the Sauber season.

My 920 continues to serve me well, but I look forward to a new flagship soon.  Does the light background consume more battery life?  I've always used the dark background, but the light can look nice with the proper home screen. Does it put more strain on the battery?     I've voiced it before: Cortana needs to ignore news sources as the user commands. I hate seeing Fox news in my daily feed. I wouldn't visit their site even if the road was paved with bitcoins.      Thanks!  How do I use the Lumia Camera to keep the subject in focus but with a blurry background?  I know nothing of photography. Where can I find tips on learning to take cooler pics?  Does anyone here use the watch pocket in your jeans?  Since I was a kid, I've been wearing Levi's jeans, but I've never found a use for that little pocket. Is it just for looks and tradition, or is everyone but me making use of it?     Thomas Dunne, an imprint of St. Martin's. What a great colophon!  With the season complete, what is the extent of changes that teams can make to their power units before next season?  I'm unclear on the ""engine freeze"" rules.     Thank you. Great information.   Why am I frequently required to verify my Microsoft account? Every few days I input the security code and my password. I don't clear my cache. So why doesn't my email account let me in?       Thank you for the words of wisdom.     68 hives? I'm cautious about maintaining only one!     Your post reminds me how much I have to learn.     Hey, I'm in Texas, too!  Queen excluder: Yes or No? I'm getting mixed messages in my rookie research.       Well, I won't actually weep. I'm kidding. But it's certainly frustrating.  Bluetooth volume drops automatically, and this makes me nigh insane.  When my 950 connects to Ford Sync, it pushes the volume way down, so I can't even hear an incoming message. This must stop before I break down and weep. Is there a fix or workaround?     My HD is the sweetest piece of hardware I own.     A red plastic peg to stop biting dogs?

If Microsoft is supposedly now bypassing the carriers to roll out updates, why am I not receiving the new firmware on my AT T Lumia 950?       I think I still need a good definition of a ""medium"" game. I can tell a heavy game from a light game, but medium seems so subjective. Any examples?  Fumbled the roll . . .       What is the difference between Germany's historic secret services, the Gestapo and the SD?  I've never understood the nuances, though I've heard them referenced in film and pop culture many times.       Actually, that's not the whole point of an online class.     This is a wonderful post.  Thank you.  Your comprehensive reply means a lot to me.  I appreciate the information and the candor.     Thank you for the reply!     As an archivist, what were some of your daily tasks?

And thanks!     Wow. Thanks for this reply. This is all valuable information that will help a lot.     Remarkably competitive? I had no idea . . . I would not have guessed it was so popular a profession.     Library science sounds like a very good fit for him.     I hadn't thought about TV. We'll definitely look into this.     Thanks for the link!  My younger brother is a history major but doesn't know what careers are available to him. Plot twist: he has Asperger's and is a social recluse. Details inside.  My younger brother is brilliant, having tested out of many basic courses at university.  He has selected history as a major because his only interests in the world (other than his cat) are consuming books on Asian and medieval European history--and playing video games on his PC.  With Asperger's, he sees the world differently, and he wants to interact with other human beings as little as possible, so this eliminates any kind of job teaching history or giving museum tours.  Think of him as extremely introverted.

My research indicated than an ""archivist"" might be something in which he'd be interested, but I don't know any archivists personally who can explain exactly what they do.  What other fields can my brother and I research that somehow link to his love for history?

He will soon be applying to graduate school, and we all hope he  has a bit of direction before then, otherwise he'll be content to live with our mum and do nothing but read and play PC games all day (now that I mention it, that doesn't sound so bad).

Thank you!     Unfortunately, my OneDrive app hangs when I open it, and the hamburger menu cannot be accessed.  It's a bummer that I can't uninstall the app and reinstall it; now I'm no longer able to access my OneDrive through the app or to auto sync my photos. : (  Is anyone else experiencing problems with OneDrive? My photos won't upload, and the OneDrive app hangs every time I open it.       Crap!  How do I turn on the front-facing flash on the 950? Does the iris scanner sign-in option need to be turned on?       Here, too.     Still is. :-)     Is Bluetooth not working in all vehicles?  Mine seems to be.     Yep, another upvote from me for Zune.  I'm still rockin' my Zune HD.     Hmm. You're right:  when I searched for ""Farming Simulator,"" the results never showed 16, only 14.  I had to click on the publisher's name to pull up the latest version 16.     Thank you!     Thanks!  What is this weird structure? It's located in a very rural area, with nothing around it for miles in any direction. I've driven by it a dozen times and always wondered about its function.

The Soviet installation tells me that I need them. Have I missed them?       Still using my 920 at this very moment.     They have?  Ben Carson stated his belief that the Pyramids of Giza were originally used to store grain, rather than royal corpses. I've never heard this hypothesis. Is there any archeological evidence to support this?        Yeah, the program here in Texas is a five-year curriculum that requires service hours, lectures, planting gardens, judging honey contests, creating workshops, et cetera.  I'm just starting out, so I wanted the inside scoop on the program.  But if you're running 6000 hives, I'd say you don't need a certificate to be called a master beekeeper!     Thanks for the response!  I have two questions, for starters.

1. Why did you personally join the program?

2.  The curriculum and requirements seem really rigorous at the higher levels.  What are you looking forward to (or fearing) the most as you work your way up the ladder?  AMA request: Someone who has completed a Master Beekeeper program (or is currently participating in one)       Thanks for sharing this. It's cool!     Are you talking about [this one](http://www.blueskybeesupply.com/copy-of-ultimate-in-hive-feeder-uhf/)?     In what ways is it better?     I know 40 isn't a big number, all things considered, but still, I am disappointed in the floats.  A few bees are drowning in my top feeder, despite the floats. I am sad.  I'm using [this top feeder](http://www.brushymountainbeefarm.com/10-Frame-Hive-Top-Feeder-w_Floats/productinfo/688/) from Brushy Mountain.  I assumed the plastic floats would prevent drowning, yet today's inspection revealed about 40 dead bees.  Does anyone have any commentary on this style of feeder?  Should I switch to a standard entrance feeder?     Hmmm.  I'm seeing the same thing here.  I'm on the Fast ring. How do I send feedback to the developers regarding specific issues I've encountered?    Writers, please stop titling your books, ""The So-and-So's Daughter.""  [removed]  USDA to invest $4 million for bee food sources       I just completed the switch to the Fast ring, and the lock screen is working again.     Cool.  I'm on the Slow ring but will switch to Fast and see what happens.  Thanks!     Sadly, no. :(     I don't believe it's technically honey if the bees are feeding on sugar syrup.

Edit:  the FDA has specific guidelines that say honey is made from the pollen of flowers.  Of course, I've only just started, so the veterans can correct me if I'm wrong.  Why has the Bing lockscreen image on my 950 stopped updating? All I see now is the default Windows splash screen. I keep toggling it in and off to see if it changes, to no avail.       Thanks!     Link?     Who is a ""big name"" beekeeper?     It's not my article. I just enjoy Mother Earth News, and they often cover beekeeping. This is definitely a beginner-level piece. Cheers!     I would buy either. Or both!  Choosing Your Honeybee Breed       IKEA is my Mecca. It can be yours, too.     I have learned more about beekeeping from this subreddit than I have from any book, video, or class.     Got it. Thanks!     Wow. So if my bees get a sugar syrup supplement, I can't call their honey ""honey""?      Why is it tainted?     This is correct.      Thanks! The difference between liquid and solid measurements was confusing me.  Does a 1:1 sugar recipe mean 8 pounds of sugar per gallon of water, as water weighs approximately 8 pounds per gallon?       Former editor here.  That's not how it works in the catalog business.  Mann Lake has no in-house proofreader who gets paid to double-check the printed media they purchase from other companies.  Mann Lake isn't to blame for a pagination error in a catalog, but you can bet that someone at the printer's end of things is paying the price (I've been on that end before!).  Bee Head-butts Communicate Danger       Good to know, thanks!  Local honey sells at the farmers' market here for $7.99 for a one-pound bottle. Is that a typical price?       6200 hives? Wow. Just, wow.     It might depend on who is doing the reporting in each state. Those numbers come from beekeepers polled, and there are probably numerous reasons why reporting is inconsistent between states.     Thanks!     Wow, I knew it was high, but 40%?  Yikes.     What type of medication?     Thanks!     Thanks for this link!  My future beekeeper  http://i.imgur.com/SvbefaR.jpg     This is something that really worries me.  You can give only a single piece of advice to a new beekeeper. What one thing do you tell them?        Bee Culture need a better proofreader. And a better layout designer wouldn't hurt. But I still enjoy it.  Still my favorite cover art from any edition of the DMG.       SCOTUS might decline to hear the case, for a variety of reasons, some of them very technical.  Not everything big goes to the high court.     Thanks!  I need a cheat sheet to keep track of the retroclones.  Anyway, this is a cool monster, and I shall use it in my (2E) campaign.  Some love for the Second Edition fighter via new kits.       This is cool!  However, I'm not familiar with the ""Hoard Class"" and ""Save"" entries in the statistics.  What OSR system?  (There are so many retroclones, it's hard to keep up.)     I think Reuters probably contains the least amount of bias, but every report will probably be slightly skewed, no matter the source.

I keep hoping for an Ambush! reprint.     Ambush!  A really good video to explain the basics to non-bee-people.       They'll release one right before they announce 6E. That's usually how it works.     I think DARLENE is just a single-name person, like Cher. You don't need to include her last name for us to know who you're talking about.

Edit: Yep, she legally eliminated her last name in 1984.     The 1890s? A homebrew? Sounds cool.
     I'd be more impressed if the climbers didn't have ladders and ropes pre-placed for them over certain difficult sections.     I remember that Larry Elmore's art was part of the attraction for me when I came upon these books in high school.  Elmore art and the Dragonlance stories are inseparable in my mind.    I think ""Mordenkainen"" and ""Fistandantilus"" are both fantastic names for magic-users. What great names have you invented for wizards in your campaign?       I need an ELI5 on this subject!  : )     So how does one know truth from fiction in articles like these, that seem legit?  As a new beekeeper, I find sites useful that explain the differences between raw honey and the stuff at Walmar",0

Blockade Runner vs Courier Hawk: am I voting for who does that pose better?

Never mind, Heat Shimmer did it best.     Hence my use of the word ""could"".     Actually I thought that part was pretty intuitive. You have a deck, you buy a ""booster"" pack that could contain cards to strengthen (or ""boost"") your deck.     Shoulda went with ""breastplate stretcher"".     No, the power is always X, so it'd be a X/X-1     When I was little I asked my older cousin what it meant to take something for ""granite"". We were outside and he told me look at the sidewalk, there's granite all around. It means you don't appreciate something because there's so much of it.     I especially like that your Mox Pearl is the only white-bordered one. Fitting.     !!!!     Eldrazi Displacer.

Also, Disfigure really gets bricked by Pendlehaven and Gitaxian Probe.     True, it depends on what is meant by ""2"".     If my 241 undoes your 241, is that a 24141?

Also, doesn't that just simplify to a 141?     Inb4 ""False Defeat defeats Defeat""     For example, ""Shock and Shatter"" is a phrase I often say while casting Kolaghans Command.     I was not advocating for four Decays, merely reminding op it's a possibility. They gave three reasons why they might prefer BG over Jund--I was trying to point out that one didn't really count (imo).     I believe  he played a mirror with Bread Nelson too, I wish we could've seen that.     Man some of you guys go all out. I don't even have matching versions of all the cards. For example: two regular Lilianas, one signed, and one RPTQ promo.     Stock Jund plays two Decays I would say. So you cut two cards for the other two Decays. That means you are cutting two red cards at most--I wouldn't say that's reason to cut the whole color.     I mean, you are allowed to play 4 Abrupt Decay in Jund.     I'll check it out.     Yes, thank you!     Poor Zodiac Pig, we hardly knew ye.     A few years ago I read an article (maybe on Star City) about a variant format where you only use 4 cards. My friends and I talk about it from time to time and I'd like to read the article again--I have no idea what it was called, nor do I remember who wrote it. Does anyone know what I'm talking about? Thanks.

I think one of the example decks was: White Chancellor, Black Lotus, Lab Maniac, Gitaxian Probe.     That deathtouch cop though.     Ask for the full 100% prizing for first and second. The intangible of the invite is worth enough to a lot of people that they'll accept. I literally saw this happen a couple months ago. First place got ""just"" the invite and second place got about 300 store credit.

At the PPTQ I won neither my opponent or myself cared about anything but the invite and we both wanted to get the other to concede gor all yhe prizes. We ended up playing where first got the invite and second got all the prizes (about 200 credit).

Also, the possibility of running into someone that doesn't care about the invite in the finals is just one reason to not split before the Top 8.     In before Lotus vs Jet round one.     Maindeck graveyard hate isn't  unreasonable. Merfolk won GPLA in may with a Relic in the 60.

""Kazandu Blademaster""--they lost.     I play Braid of Fire in my Red Akroma EDH deck. Works great with Morph and Firebreathing.     Axe Land?     I have a Daze with ""Harm's Way"" written on the back.     I think I just broke Modern:

4 Lost in the Woods

56 Unhinged Forests

These sleeves.     ;)     I didn't pay too much attention to the Conspiracy sets, so I've never seen Enraged Revolutionary before. It seems like a solid creature--has anyone tried it out before? Do you find it gets in a good amount of damage, or does it just die to Doom Blade?     I love the Horcrux stuff but I don't think it technically works.  I believe  Creature and Tribal are the only card types that are allowed to share subtypes. So if Horcrux is an Artifact subtype, Harry and Nagini can't have it, and if it's a Creature subtype the rest can't have it.  I think you'd need to either:

1) Leave Horcrux as an Artifact subtype and turn Harry and Nagini into Legendary Artifact Creatures.

or

2) Turn Horcrux into a Creature subtype and make the Ring, Diadem, Cup, etc. into Legendary Tribal Artifacts.

I'd go with option 2.     Blue Island

Land--Island

Blue Island is Blue.     Maybe a keyword/mechanic that severly nerfs the effect if you already have a copy of the card in your graveyard or exile.

Path to Dispatch W

Instant

Exile target creature.

Diminishing Returns--if there is card named Path to Dispatch in your graveyard or exile zone, instead tap that creature.     ""No rest, no mercy, mo matter what""

And

""The Specimen seems to be broken""

From Akroma and Deep Analysis, respectively.      Fair enough.  Funnily, they have slightly different ratings on Gatherer.     How did you decide that BFM would take up only one slot? My inclination would be for both halves to have be seperate.     I have a Sakashima EDH deck that over the years has to devolved to a state where the win condition is just having three Ulamog in play.     Every time I see this black circle I think it's Damnation.     Limitless Power? Not enough to beat my little snake friend.     I always wished I could mash the instant effect of Abbot of Keral keep with the mana-independent effect of Dark Confidant. And then there's Silvergil Adept, but she's pretty deck-restrictive:

Abbob

1 b/r

Human Wizard

Kicker 3 or Reveal a Merfolk from your hand.

Prowess

When this ETB, reveal the top card of your deck, put it in your hand and take damage equal to its cmc. If you paid the kicker this ability triggers twice.

2/1     As long as the red one gets a random card.     Does that make them binique?     (number of relevant 4-card hands that get you your 3 remaining types) divided by (total number of 4-card hands)

So figure out each combination that gets you Delirium (such as Creature-Sorcery-Sorcery-Land) and figure out how many ways there are to get that combination of types. (So 13*5*4*23 assuming all those cards are in your deck). Add those all up, and divide the sum by how many possibilities there are.

I only have a rudimentary knowledge of programming but here's my pseudo code If anyone want to type it up. I think the logic is sound but wouldn't mind being double-checked. Sorry if my notation is wonky.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

%Program: Odds of getting Delirium after a Vessel of Nascency.

% T is a vector whose entries are ({list of types}, # cards in deck with exactly those types)

% C for creature, A for artifact, S for sorcery, etc

% You can change these numbers based on the game state.

T=[ ({C}, 13), ({A,C},3), ({S},5), ({I},8), ({E}, 4), ({P},4), ({L},23) ]

%G is the set of card types known to be in the graveyard after Vessel resolves.

% It starts with E because of the Vessel. If there's other types already you can add them in here.

G={E}

%D is the number of cards in the deck

D=Sum_{i=1}^{length(T)} T[i][2]

%Q is the number of possible four-card hands

Q= D choose 4

%R is the number of relevant four-card hands that would grant Delirium.

% ie the number of hands with three or more non-enchantment card types.

% Starts at zero. We will modify.

R=0

% The following loop looks at all the possible combinations of types from four cards.

% H is a combination of card types from four cards.

% P is the number of ways to make the combination out of cards in the deck.

% If the combination and graveyard don't give Delirium we replace P with 0; it's irrelevant.

% S replaces T while calculating P to account for repeated types in a combination.

% To find the final value of R we add up all the relevant P values.

**For i from 1 to length(T)**

S=T

H=S[i][1]

P=S[i][2]

S[i][2]=S[i][2]-1

**For j=i to length(T)**

H=H union S[j][1]

P=P*S[j][2]

S[j][2]=S[j][2]-1

**For k=j to length(T)**

H=H union S[k][1]

P=P*S[k][2]

S[k][2]=S[k][2]-1

**For l=j to length(T)**

H=H union S[l][1]

P=P*S[l][2]

if |H union G| 4, then P =0

if P0, then P=0

R=R+P

%End Loop

Output R/Q     Conscripts vs Lark hurts.     Haha, thanks. Definitely didn't ""develop"" it.     Poor Craw Wurm. It's like the doctor telling you you have six months to live.     I thought cards with an Overload cost cheaper than their mana cost would be neat:

Desperate Times 5G

Instant

Target player gains 10 life

Overload G (Instead, each player gains 10 life).     I find I can never have enough perfect fit sleeves. Maybe 60ish packs of those?     You've got two years to learn!     Monarch cards?     Damn, it excludes LEGOs.     Respect for the main deck Destructive Revelry.     Can I get the Oracle text for that child's picture?     Let us know how it goes!     Oracle Update:
Zur's Weirding 3U
Enchantment
Players play with their hands revealed.

Explanation: This is a funtional change. It was done to bring the card in line with its' online counterpart. Now players can enjoy a uniform experience in both paper and online play.     Don't Dredge and Burn both play Stomping Ground?     I agree UR=Purple. But you know that UR Thing in the Ice deck that's been picking up popularity in Modern? Using this association:

Thing in the Ice = TITI = titty = nipple = nurple,

I call that deck Purple Nurple.     ""Combo""     Oh the humanity.     I love me a Bolas-Ugin Team up, but this takes the cake.     I use an oversleeve.      Where's the Kofi spot?     ""Kinda sucks""

Riiight.     3     Great Furnace, Lotus Petal, Mox Opal, Lightning Bolt, Chain Lightning, Lava Spike, Gut Shot.     If it's becoming sentient, you should probably see a doctor.     The way I understand it is that according to WOTC's definition of functionality, Snow Duals WOULD be identical to Alpha Duals.  From the Official Reprint Policy:

 Reserved cards will never be printed again in a functionally identical form. A card is considered functionally identical to another card if it has the same card type, subtypes, abilities, mana cost, power, and toughness.

[link](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/official-reprint-policy-2010-03-10)

Notice that this list of relevant characteristics does not include Supertypes like Snow or Legendary.     That kinda defeats the point.     Stormstorm Crow?     Zurgo vs Bladewing is also a battle of second versions.     Captain Tickles, Captain Tickles, swinging in the red zone for my team.     I'd still vote for Quirion Trailblazer over Wild Wanderer if ot came in The Magic Bracket.     ELI5 how Judge foils are distributed and the rate they hit the market. Specifically I want the new Mystic Confluence. I see a couple on eBay already with $50 starting bids, but my observation on a couple past cards is that they start very high (For instance I believe both Force of Will and Mana Drain were double their current prices).

TLDR: When will Mystic Confluence be $25?     Damn I love how you just errata all the white creatures to be rebels.     I have two stories from the Modern Gauntlet after PTOGW, that highlight the quirks of MTGO play.

1) It's a long game of Company vs Chord. My opponent has Spike Feeder, I have Murderous Redcap. They topdeck Archangel of Thune, gain a bunch of life and pass the turn threatening lethal with the Angel. I topdeck Collected Company and find Melira and Viscera Seer. If it were paper I would win this game because I begin my combo and the first thing I do is kill the Spike. My opponent could gain a bunch of life before it dies but that fine because I would then deal them infinite damage. What happened here though was that my opponent gained like 600 life before his Spike died.  If you're familiar wiith these combos on MTGO you'll know that the Spike/Angel combo involves far fewer clicks than the Melira/sac/persist combo, in particular because you can actually yield to the triggers in the former.  So basically my opponent was playing the clock by executing their faster combo 300 times, where my way out would be to execute my more clunkier combo 300 times as well. I decided to go for it rather than concede and got about 50 iterations in before I made a mistake.  I don't begrudge my opponent though, I think it was a smart thing to do.

2) My opponent cast Scapeshift and I'm dead to rites. I think to myself ""maybe they'll accidentally click the wrong thing and just sac all their lands""--and then it happened! They asked me to concede but I think that would've been an insult to the universe obliging my thoughts there.     (If you assume the damage needs to be dealt in increments of 9, the formula I find below is quite nice.  It will give an overestimation some of the time, but it shouldn't be by too much.)

Cast Breya. Sac her and a token. Cast again. Sac two tokens. Sac Breya and a token.

That's 9 damage for 16 mana. (4+2+(4+2)+2+2)

If you want to repeat this process it costs an additional 6 mana each time. So the second 9 damage costs 22 mana, the third 9 damage costs 28 mana, and so on. This gives us an arithmetic sequence (an ordered list):

 16, 22, 28, 34, 40, 46, . . .

Let's say we need to deal 45 damage. This will cost us 16+22+28+34+40=140 mana. You may notice that 45 is the fifth multiple of 9 and that we added up the first 5 numbers in the list.  In general, the sum of the first N terms of an arithmetic sequence can actually be found quickly by this equation:

S_N =N[a_1 +a_N ]/2

where a_N is the Nth term in the list above (For example, a_5 =40). a_N can also be found by the formula

 a_N =a_1+D(N-1)

where D is the difference in each number in the list. For us D=6.

Using these facts we get

 S_N =N[16+16+6(N-1)]/2

which simplifes to the mana-formula we want **(TLDR:)**

 S_N =13N+3N^2 

[Note] to get N: Round each opponents life up to a multiple of 3; add up those numbers and then divide by nine; round up to the nearest integer to get N.

Let's do an example. Say we have three opponents at 21, 34 and 83 life.  Round these numbers to 21, 36 and 84. Then 21+36+84=141. Then 141/9 =15.67 so we round up to get N=16. Then we just use the formula to find out how much mana we need:

 S_16 =13(16)+3(16)^2 =976     I almost accidentally didn't vote for Deep Analysis.  The Torment version has one of my favorite flavor texts.     Siege Rhino so good he's even insulated from his controller's mistakes.     That's Rogue Two :P     Inb4 Pack Rat is Mythic in MMA17     I like the design space the second ability is exploring, granting feelings.     Tbf, it's still weird to me that me and my opponent could have the same card.     Is Crosis's Attendant Ironman?     That shortlist wasn't as short as I thought it'd be.     I like to keep playsets in penny sleeves.     My friend like to joke along the same line that Goyf has been ""pre-printed"" and reprinted, but never printed.     I didn't realize Eldritch Evolution exiled itself and I kept wondering why no one had thought to go from 3 to 7 just by having a Goblin Dark Dwellers in their deck.     It's creepy and it's cooky . . .     Is this in the same vein as Living Twin?     Don't call me . . .     In contrast, I once had five Darkheart Slivers in 3x Planar Chaos draft with no other slivers. It doesn't exactly synergize with itself.      What is slush art?     Maybe the progression should be untap draw upkeep. The first two are so natural to start the turn with once you've played a while. Is there any reason this would be a bad idea?     Looks like Gloom has errata to affect all white enchantments.     ""Then take a breath""     Fire Dragon is so basic, I love it.

I like Auriok Gaivemaster's style, flipping off Halimar Wavewatch, who's just looking away wantin' none of that.

Also voting for Kami of the Painted Road because it reminds me of Thing from the Adams Family. Sorry Hootie.

Toughest vote for me so far is Cryoclasm vs Resounding Thunder.  The former was sweet in a world of shock lands, but I do enjoy the design of ""cycling for more"".

I should probably vote for Storage Matrix, but isn't Messenger Drake just everything I want in a Magic card?

SWAMP!     Why is this not a rebel?     If you have multiple copies of this card, Nicol will get an extra counter for each.     My friend has conspiracies in his Cube. Last time we played I got Sovereign's Realm and Worldknit first two picks, along with exactly 3 other conspiracies. It was glorious.     This was years ago. My roommate cast Terastadon, I play Gather Specimens in response. I get the 9/9 and use the trigger to destroy three of his things, then I also get the tokens.

We don't live together anymore.     I was just thinking today during an edh game that I needed a double wide playmat.     Let's just get rid of pile-shuffling altogether. If you want to count your deck, then just count it--it takes me 15 seconds.     The opponent could just tap all their lands in response to Piracy, right?      No Matt Sperling?     To elaborate a bit on what others are saying, this is my understanding of the situation: 

1) Flayer deals lethal damage to Explorer and combat damage to Defending Player, simultaneously. This causes Flayer's ability to trigger BUT before it can go on the stack, State Based Actions are checked.

2) State Based Actions are checked. Since the Explorer has lethal damage it dies and its ability triggers, but again is not yet placed on the stack.

3) State Based Action checked again. Nothing to deal with, move on.

4) Finally we put triggered abilities on the stack. There are two ""waiting"", and the active player's will go on first (the Flayer trigger).     Duke vs Nelson a few years ago at GP Miami (?) Top8.     Ajani--Matthew Perry

Hmm, am I the only one that finds it interesting German creature types use commas?     Don't they get saved in the Freeform binder?     Remi Fortier vs Andre Mueller PT Final (Valencia?), was one of my favorites growing up.     Buy you Bayou.     Atraxa?     Titans     Less offensive than ""Tango Lands"" ;)     The Gatewatch combining like a Megazord.     I've always been a fan of Cephalids.     Yavimaya Scion is pretty funny.     That makes sense, then they wouldn't need to banned in Vintage.     M10. Lightning Bolt and Ball Lightning brought me back.      Skywing Aven and Stormwatch Eagle on the same page.     What do you have?     I get that, usually whenever I pop a Mishra's Bauble on turn one without having a land in play yet.

For me it's not such a big deal as it is for you though. I just click that report button a bunch of times until the client closes and the restart. My Disconnected and Rejoined entries in the chat log often have the same timestamp.     Once playing my friend's Cube, I had both Worldknit and Sovereign's Realm first and second pick. It was glorious, but the highlight was casting Recross the Paths just to stack my deck.     If you can read this, you're a monster geek.     Having that DRS playmat to go with it is just gravy.     What am I missing?     can you just print 9 at a time?     Did anyone else pronounce this in their mind as Idden Erbalists?     I have a fatties version of this I call ""DC100"".  It's pretty popular with friends and a great way to play with strangers.

*4 Damnation

*4 Living Wish

The idea of this deck is that you play all the best cards plus a bunch of wishes in order to get more copies (since I can only have 4 in my maindeck but as many as I want in my binder).

**Round 1 vs Nelly with Elves (homebrew!)**

She got me low by flooding the board and attacking, but I stabilized with Damnation. Then I played some Stormcrows which all her 1/1s couldn't block or attack into, and I eventually pecked away for the win.

**Round 2 vs Gery with Lantern Control (filthy netdeck)**

He got out Ensnaring Bridge and emptied his hand really quick. I was able to land a Rhino and equip it with Twin, but he stopped my combo with Pithing Needle. I had to use Glittering, Living and Death Wish to get mor",0

You doin a dissertation?   list of potential feeders for avic avic?  anyone want to share a variety of things they have fed their avic or know can be fed to one?     what does it eat?  chemistry and physics discussion    people obsessed with chemistry    Podcasts for orgo 1    for those who believe there is more to be discovered in the field of chemistry /r/TheoreticalChemistry    Is further research on the alpha-effect for nucleophiles necessary?  this seems difficult to conclude. I am not too confident that solvent-dependence explains the phenomenon in every case. thoughts?  quantum lecture    try /r/TheoreticalChemistry for discussion of current issues in modern chemistry and physics. puzzling questions and interesting links also welcome    interesting orgo lecture from UC Irvine    Is aromaticity still being researched in depth? (link responses encouraged)  How satisfied is the chem and physics community with our current understanding and utilization of aromaticity?   are there any tried and true drills/practices you know of for developing and improving single-variable calculus skills?  single-variable calculus can be highly frustrating during the learning process and seems to provoke a fear in many students including myself      jumped into a high level calc 1 too early and needed to sharpen up after an unfortunate break from practicing math. 3d year undergrad but I switched my major etc...    Has the nucleophilic alpha-effect in organic chemistry been fully explained?  [removed]     thanks      you protonate the hydroxyl group, then it takes 2 electrons and leaves as neutral water and you have your carbocation which will be tertiary because im assuming you started with hexamethylcyclohexanol? then a hydrogen + (or proton) is lost to regenerate your acid catalyst (H3O+) and the electrons from that broken sigma bond between the carbon and the lost hydrogen will form a pi bond finally giving you hexamethylcyclohex(1,2)ene. now someone please answer my post thanks lol     I am just wondering if at any point a ""string theorist"" has stumbled with an undergrad math course, ... as in could I still potentially become one if I struggled with an undergrad course. and I won't be offended by an honest answer lol   anyone into string theory on here ever struggle with a math class? or was it just easy As from pre-algebra all the way to topology and diff eq etc  be honest its the internet youre really not that tough   Has the nucleophilic alpha-effect been fully explained yet? Or is there still research needing to be done?  I have read that there is some confidence in the solvent-dependent hypothesis, which is justified by the lack of the phenomenon in gas phase reactions. But there is also a little confidence in the explanation that the lone pair from the adjacent nucleophile (example molecules hydrazine and hydroxylamine) is capable of stabilizing the decrease in electron density during transition states of Sn2 reactions. Has it yet been speculated that it could be due in some way to negative hyperconjugation? I am just trying to come up with a research project.   Feeding Cave crickets to my pink-toe?

Confused about my future career  [removed]     I think that the explanation for dark matter/energy is going to require a mind willing to take big risks and propose completely new things. Kinda like Einstein with his gravity and relativity. Its going to be something that is at first recognized as ""too far-fetched"" or insane. But I seriously doubt it's going to relate to what we know now (ex: some odd explanation using quantum particles)  The process of publishing a new reaction mechanism  can anyone describe what this entails?     the wording is very careful and has a nice rhythm     excellent use of imagery. I like the touch of surrealism too.     how did you manage to go from an 18xx 5k guy in HS to an elite, since most elites are always 14-15xx 5k runners in high school and receive a ton of support the whole way. how did you work around other things in life?     not only do they not flush lactate but they produce more and lactate is NOT relevant at all stop talking about lactate its just a glycolysis intermediate and if you read any exercise physiology book it will tell you that it is NOT the CAUSE of fatigue or oxygen debt     TRY 12-16x400 a little faster than 10k pace, you also should have no problem running at least 3 miles continuously at goal pace, so do 3 mile tempos in 18:00 regularly, or even 21:00 for 3 and a half. also dont be shy to do 10x 2 minutes fast 1 minute slow followed by another 30 minutes of running and 8x200 fast, probably some weight lifting and plyos too. also dont go to letsrun...trust me, JUST dont      burned out like Webb but probably worse     do standing leg abductions to strengthen it, anyone who tells you to stretch it has never had IT band inflammation, or they just got lucky, ice is also useless, inflammation is there for a reason, and when your body wants it gone the lymphatic system will remove it, ice inhibits the natural healing processes and stretching a damaged tissue makes it more damaged, if a piece of paper is torn... do you stretch it? no you strengthen it with tape       you Cain fans are so ridiculous, there is nothing inspiring about her, did she overcome adversity to get to where she is? no! she got LUCKY, YES LUCK. lucky to be genetically gifted, she doesnt work any harder than girls running a 5:45 mile, not to mention she gets to use fuckin underwater treadmills and elite coaching... not fair to other teenage girls      interesting.

I have calc 2 under my belt but have not yet taken ODE's.   any good books on the real projective plane?  [removed]  are there jobs for mathematicians which involve alternative energy research ?  [removed]     The Book of proof by Hammack. it's got a lot of exercises and describes the thinking behind proofs      that's what I seem to have trouble with right now. not knowing what to assume      that answers my question pretty well thanks   when practicing proofs, how long will you typically spend on a proof?  I know the answer varies a lot. But say its a class like analysis or linear algebra. and you want to spend an hour or two practicing proofs. how long will you spend on each one?      alright thanks   has anyone read Antoni Zygmund's book on trigonometric series?  would you recommend it? I have recently become interested in set theory and sequences/series      sick !     Try Steve Coleman and the Five Elements? they have a very unique sound in my opinion, really makes you think while listening to it      wow apparently redditors all have amazing taste in music, the only thing I haven't seen that I like so far is the classical genre.

I am comfortable with linear algebra and calculus. I love proofs. I like set theory, topology, analysis... etc those types of subjects. However... I know absolutely ZERO programming whatsoever. I am afraid of it and haven't been required to learn any yet.

I play just regular.   I literally do not get any fucking better at ALL.... EVER whats the fucking deal  I stay in the 800s on lichess. chess is fucking impossible its like I have a chess learning disorder mother of fuck how long does it take to get even remotely somewhere with this frustrating fucking game. its not fun at all right now  whats the deal with potting soil substrate? would you recommend it for my avic avic?  sometimes I have trouble maintaining humidity without constantly spraying      same     not at all probably the majority if I had to guess   my dream is to be a physicist/mathematician but the world is telling me no  there is nothing else I could ever imagine doing bu I keep failing essential classes and all of my friends are graduating. lifes a bitch      I feel the complete and exact opposite. I feel like nobody else has any problems in their life and everything runs smoothly.      also I just said strategy, there has got to be some sort of basic strategy. but thanks ill check the source      dude its just that im losing horribly against level 0 computers on like 11x11 boards    jumping spiders are 13% of all spiders families. what makes their anatomy/physiology so advantageous?  the hydraulic system they use to move? their eyesight? both? just food for thought      honestly I think it all boils down to lack of good algebra. but im ok with trig i feel, also I never said anything about the theory of diff eq calm down      wow I can appreciate the effort you put into that      I just don't understand how I can be comfortable with abstraction, graph theory, set theory, some amount of 1st and 2nd order diff equations but calc 1 is impossible except for integration   is it possible to get a global warming debate going between Bill Nye and Freeman Dyson?

I was a terrible student in high school and took the minimum amount of math     for some reason I just cant perform on tests. I can swear I understand the material. its so annoying   could use advice from mathematicians who may be able to relate?  I have always loved mathematics and have recently decided I would like to try to pursue math and physics. the problem is I am finding it impossible to make it through calc 1. It feels like a huge block at this point and Im starting to conclude that maybe I should just bite the bullet and move on to another thing. has anyone ever had this experience...?
     geometry and some topology. the maths more or less yeah I guess Im not sure where to go for the physics. thanks.   trying to get into understanding yang-mills  anyone have useful advice on a good starting point?   what does everyone do with their molts?  I currently have owned my first tarantula (avic avic) for about 7 months and he just had his first molt. I am not sure what people tend to do with them afterwards? I definitely do not intend to throw it out.      thanks for the replies      thanks.   putting my avic in his aquarium out in the sunlight?  I haven't tried it because I want to know if it is ok first. seems to me like it would be a natural heat and light source. thoughts/experiences?  having difficulty with double stroke rolls in traditional grip  my fastest (clean) double stroke roll with traditional grip is significantly slower than it is with match grip.      you know you could have likely given a helpful or interesting answer or at least nothing at all yet you instead decided to be a pretentious fuck who wants to jack off some jizz in your mouth like ""oh there is single and multi variable calc and advanced calc is an arbitrary term"" but you decided instead to be a dick. fuck you and everyone who looks like you       says the person conversing with random people on the internet who probably does so daily... fucking idiot. youre clearly not a mathematician with that lack of consistent logic   difference between advanced calc and calc 1-3 ?  what is different about advanced that isnt covered in single and multi vairable at undergrad level?     perfect thanks  does the poincare conjecture use contracting rings to imply contracting spheres?  is it correct to interpret that it is stating that since ANY ring contained within the 3 manifold is capable of contracting to a point, it follows that the collection of contractable rings in 3d space can be represented as contracting spheres?      I am already well into being a chemistry major. so I plan to get a BS in chem but may go to grad school for something more rooted in math and I want to know how to become skilled at maths  want to be a mathematician...  I want to be a much better mathematician and study some graduate level mathematics in the future. I currently know calc 1, 2. some calc 3 and a small amount of set theory. I am interested in topology. any advice on where to go from here? thanks  The movie Whiplash  so I really enjoyed the type of jazz in this movie and would love some suggestions as to what to listen to which is very similar to this style of fast tempo jazz. Thanks.   considering going to grad school for physics... but Im not a physics major. thoughts?  I am a chemistry major falling in love with math and physics. But still love chemistry equally.   can someone help explain the Nambu-Goto action?  especially in regards to how it is derived? thanks      can you explain how to derive V(t)= t+ t^3 -t^4 for a trefoil? I just want to understand the basics of applying it.   new to topology. is this thread still active?  I study chemistry as an undergrad and recently am becoming interested in topology. will take any advice on getting into it   anyone have a way to help explain the Jones Polynomial?  having a bit of difficulty understanding it, today is my first day getting into it. links to videos etc are encouraged      because I have been rejected a trillion times in less than a year and Im good looking and athletic... sorry that sounds cocky but come on... its easy to know if youre good looking or not. lets not kid ourselves. as evidence I have been offered (and turned down for many reasons) modeling jobs       maybe if women didnt fucking hate sex so much we would hear less about rape   avicularia avicularia as we all know tend to get along when housed together. would an avic avic get along with a versicolor if they were housed together?  I currently have 1 adult male avic avic in a good sized (tall) enclosure. how would this go? would they fight? crossbreed? or hopefully none of the above ?      thanks for the reply. I have not studied string theory beyond nambu-goto and polyakov yet. I still have a lot of quantum and relativity to learn. I do not have a bachelors yet or anything.      I was NOT trying to claim anything grandiose (like him predicting quantum) at all. I was just saying that the quote reminds me of the double slit experiment and how some people interpret it. I suppose you disagree.   this Nietzsche quote seems to describe the double slit experiment in my opinion. tell me what you think just for kicks?  ""That which gives us such an extraordinarily firm faith in causality, is not the rough habit of observing the sequence of processes; but our inability to interpret a phenomenon otherwise than as the result of a design"" ... ""Question: Is the design the cause of the phenomenon? Or is that also illusion? Is it not the phenomenon itself?""   is gravity the reason we cant make something hit absolute zero?  as in maybe gravity affects the length of a string?     alright lol I might just not use it anymore. just thought Id give it a try  so how exactly are you supposed to use Tinder?  just got it 4 days ago. im a male in my young 20s. im in shape and not horrible looking. I have 0 matches and its frustrating. also are you supposed to message girls on snapchat when they give their username if you havent matched with them? how the fuck does everyone else know how to do this      this is gold     when people say adderall is meth     true I have none      do you have any good sources per chance? NOTHING is working so far and I just dont understand it. like organic chemistry is literally EASY to me, like a fucking joke of a college class. so how could it possibly be a genetic incapability? I really doubt this.      thanks.      I have the most incredibly strange and frustrating dilemma. I can easily explain what is going on theoretically/conceptually in calculus. and can work out problems. but I just can not perform on tests. I get very nervous and end up failing. and I wouldnt say maths in general no. math might be my favorite subject which is just embarrassing       I dont think struggling in one math is a good reason to not switch but thanks for the input   want to switch my efforts to physics but feel like I shouldnt  I am currently studying chemistry at uni and am in my early 20s. I have already switched my major once. I have really taken a liking to the concepts of physics but am struggling with math a.t.m and am terrified of the idea of switching? anyone have practical advice or some shit? thanks     does this make you a bad reader? short answer: no. long answer .... No. and you DID interpret it on your own. you just decided to compare      it just seems difficult to understand intuitively. multiple time dimensions feels more plausible but this makes sense      both great explanations thanks   If the 4th dimension is relativistic rather than spatial, then why is it assumed that the remaining 7 are spatial and not relativistic?  ? Im very new to string theory and know nothing beyond nambu-goto and polyakov so there is no need to be rude por favor      fair  would you say THC has 7 or 8 resonance structures?  correction I think its 8 or 9 Im going with 9     I just looked that up lol I didnt actually know they had that wow.     by the way the ""mirror images"" are called enantiomers. just in case my explanation sucked and you wish to research it a little      methamphetamine is methylated amphetamine, so the nitrogen (there is only one nitrogen per molecule) has a methyl (CH3) group attached. the biological activities are different because of this. further, amphetamine and methamphetamine both have NON superimposable mirror images of their RESPECTIVE molecules. some people will say it has a left handed and right handed version of itself. you may have heard of these for amphetamine as levo and dextro amphetamine. the atoms and bonds and everything are the same (remember im talking about levo vs dextro amphetamine at this point). BUT despite this they have different chemical and biological properties. meaning when discussing methamphetamine and amphetamine you really have just mentioned FOUR DIFFERENT molecules all with different biological activity and different chemical properties       literally laughed out loud   is anyone else getting unbelievably sick of people saying adderall is literally meth with a brand name?  everyone here knows how incredibly far from true this is.      fine ill just delete it all      for the hell of it I was hoping for POLITE comments criticism whatever, just wanted to make sure its a correct statement. its a shame that people who claim they love math love to discourage others from pursuing it. and we wonder why America is so poorly ranked in math       oh so every single post is written by a genius like yourself? so sorry I am not WORTHY. Christ people on the internet have huge cybermuscles and brains. youre such a cock      never said it was a brilliant discovery I even admitted its kinda stupid, so suck my dick      thanks for the clarity I thought it was ""an opinion or conclusion formed on the basis of incomplete information""     is this how you respond to every conjecture? its a statement sorry to disturb you while youre jerking off into your mouth      lol I love how much of a cock everyone is, I just started looking into graph theory a few WEEKS ago.      thanks all  pink toe vs moth  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVX4VfSAfQ4     appreciate it. I have issues with the bass foot and how/when to use it as well, using the high hat confuses me   having great troubles coordinating my high hat foot while playing jazz.  anyone know how to overcome this barrier ?  taking calc 1 for the fourth time any of you math geniuses who flew through it without studying (yes I know you didnt) wanna give me advice on how to not take it a FIFTH time? thanks  let me guess a smart ass trolling change your major comment? very clever       lol guess thats that     thats what I got but I have a weird hunch this isnt correct     strictly algebraic evaluation      I want to prove that it is not metrizable without just saying it needs to be Hausdorff   [Calc 1].

x-0               I know but I literally said ""could be at all useful"" in the context of the books. that doesnt seem to imply ""the only study tool"" to me.      dude. Im just asking if its a good tool for the arsenal. I never said the only tool. I appreciate the effort put into this response but I dont think its all completely necessary. essentially I am asking for yes or no to the following question: while studying the concepts of Godels incompleteness theorems, are those logical puzzles completely useless? or do they have some merit? shouldnt be too insane to postulate an answer lol.        do you think that ""Godel-ian"" logic puzzles like those in Raymond Smullyan's books could be at all useful in developing a better understanding of the concept and perhaps (maybe mildly) improve other relevant skills?  why is this topological space not metrizable?  Topology (Z, J) where: Z= the set of positive integers. For each positive integer n, O-sub(n)={n, n+1, n+2,...}. J= {null, O-sub1, O-sub2,...}     this is pretty much what I was thinking. like how Richard Feynman was very fast at doing some algebra/calc required for physics which was a skill he had from competitions   to what extent is repetition important in mathematics?  as in doing a decent volume of practice problems, even when they arent too difficult to do.      except for the top group... but thanks. I should maybe just do it  questions for research mathematicians (or maybe just those aspiring to be)  I would appreciate a description of what it is like to have a job in this field. and what were your steps toward becoming a mathematician. did you earn your first degree in something other than math? how many hours a week do you work. and is this field worth looking into if you love math?     nice im 21 and am starting to consider it     but definitely differentiable. are there calc optimization problems that are non-differentiable?     eh, just challenging in the sense that you kinda have to sit there a minute to think of how to model it I suppose   tricky optimization problems  does anyone have a source for a few examples of challenging optimization problems for single variable calc? thanks      gimme both lol I dont know much rap   need some recommendations for old school artists  Im looking for some really old school minimalist rap. something to really represent the origins of modern rap  what are some of the best calculus books you know of?  I have 2 standard calc textbooks that im bored of in a way, and was wondering if anyone knows of any really good ones worth investing in      I feel like it depends on the compound       ""I'm tired of women in America who have had nothing but privilege their whole lives telling me they are oppressed."" THIS !!!!!!! I agree so much lol     my point exactly. youre an arrogant piece of shit.      I hope next time they just set off a fucking bomb and kill all you useless pieces of fucking shit   this school fucking sucks  [removed]     oh sorry its more like for an arbitrary neighborhood epsilon there is an arbitrary neighborhood delta contained within epsilon. for any infinitesimally small or large arbitrary shit a shit ton of arbitrary shit can be arbitrarily arbitrary. happy? fucking Christ im sick of taking calculus ONE      the limit approaching a point exists from both sides infinitesimally? within a neighborhood epsilon there is a neighborhood delta ? idk why splitting atom sized hairs is going to help me with something so trivial as calculus 1 questions   at what age did you decide that you wanted to study maths and potentially become a mathematician?  Is anyone else here like me who didnt decide this until after age 20? I feel pretty discouraged since im in my early 20s and everyone is ahead of me.      Im very good at understanding definitions theorems and concepts but very unbelievably bad at applying them.

God for fucking bid I just get a simple no or no thanks outright and up front. noooooo. women like to lead you on first only so they can ignore you when you text them as their version of saying no or they agree to go out sometime only to come up with every excuse in the book not to fucking go out when you ask them.

Im just a highly frustrated and disappointed person I guess is how to explain it.      yep lol     I feel like this might only be true for metrizable topological spaces? not sure though  does anyone know where to find how Euler calculated taxicab number(4,2,2)?  I just learned that the taxicab number problem is actually a very deep problem in number theory. just wondering how he went about getting this number.     why then     lol     prove the product of two odd numbers is odd. 

prove there are 2,598,960 different 5 card hands from a standard 52 card deck. 

prove that if A divides B and B divides C, then A divides C.   why do they say the most important work you do in math happens by age 30-40?  I dont understand this even remotely im lost     thanks thats actually what I was thinking      depends on the problem      in calculus anything over 0 is infinity      thanks      the question doesnt say differentiable. it just says prove that a continuous 1:1 function on [a,b] is either increasing or decreasing.     yes  proving that a 1:1 function on a closed interval is either increasing or decreasing.  Im not completely sure how to set up the proof for this. Im not asking for the proof and actually please do not post it. Im just wondering if it is necessary to use some sort of example function or not, since one was not given. OR should I use proof by contradiction to show that if we have a value for which f'(c)=0 , then there is a y value corresponding to more than one x value? thanks.      oh you have to subtract the repeats?

With your hundred dollars, let's say they made 900$. Now they have 101,000$. Since the company benifitted from your money, the stock is worth more. Now if you sell that 0.1% back, you'll get 101$. 

     Basically, they're printing money. A lot of it. Sounds like a good idea right? Wrong. Think about it like this, country A has 100B currency, which equates to 10B US dollars. If country A decides to print another 100B currency, then the value of the currency drops by half. 
 

This is really, really bad. Let's say you have 10,000 currency, and overnight the currency dropped in value by half. Then the prices will double, but the value stays the same. This makes people extermely poor. Which worsens the economic situation, which sends them on a downward spiral. 
     Now we know why hitler gassed them      ""Do it!"" I shouted at Alexia. She looked a bit nervous, but we all are the first time. I grab her arm and we jump off the cliff together. She was screaming, she wished she never jumped. The ground is approaching faster and faster. We were stopped by the bungee cable and by the end we were laughing together and wanted to go for a second round. 

A few years ago in 2039, automated machines replaced all human jobs, even government jobs. They removed the concept of money from our society, and now all the humans can visit anywhere and do anything(if it's not harmful to someone else) for free. The machines can even predict which people are ""made"" for each. They have always had 100% accuracy. If it wasn't for the wonderful AI Alexia and I wouldn't be able to take a 3 month honeymoon in Oman, or even worse, we never would've met. 

After we finished bungee jumping, Alexia and I went to visit Marneef caves to see the natural blowholes. As we were standing on the surrounding lush hills, she lay her head on my shoulder and said ""thank AI that we can be here, it's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen"". I smiled and kissed the top of her head. We sat there and we're watching the sea rise and fall, and kept thinking to myself ""How could've people ever lived without the Almighty AI?"" We sat together until nightfall, then we had a car drive us back to the Crown Plaza hotel. 

We spent that night the same way we spent every other night, we took some dinner to the beach and had food while joking around. After we finsihed our dinner, we would cuddle together and talk of sweet nothings. We would end the night when Alexia would fall asleep on me and I would lie next to her and fall asleep with the slight, by sweet smell of her. 

We spent the remainder of the honeymoon in a similar fashion, and then returned back home. When we got home there was a letter addressed to me from The Lord AI. It specifically told me to read this all alone. I told Alexia that his Greatness AI wants me to read this alone, she smiled slightly and kissed me ""You're so loyal to the AI, I'm so proud that they picked you for whatever it is they want."" She kissed me again and left. I read the letter and as I progressed through it, all I wanted was to start. 

I told Alexia that I had to leave for around a month, she was really supportive and wished me well. I flew over to North Korea for the task, then flew back with the items. I entered the building, nervous, but pushed on to the main AI. I bowed to His Majesty, and told him ""I have procured the requested items from Them."" He replied ""Thank you Comrade, please empty all the human brains into the central system, the current brains are starting to weaken""     Better to be annoyed than dead     Take 200 pennies, heat half of them and cool the other half, place in cup, pour down the creditor's shirt.      Basically, copyright. So let's say I make a movie, and sell the universal rights of that movie to Netflix. After I sold the rights, the movie belongs to Netflix and they can do whatever they want with it, as in show it in any country they want. However, big companies like Disney wouldn't sell universal rights because they'll lose money, so they tell Netflix that they'll allow them to show Cinderella in America, but not in luxumburg. Netflix can apply for the rights in luxumburg, but Disney won't sell it/Netflix doesn't think they'll get their money back if they buy Cinderella for luxumburg.      Lesotho is completely covered by South Africa. It has no borders with any other country. Kinda weird it doesn't just join South Africa.      When someone gloats over something they didn't do. ""Oh look at my brother, he's in the newspaper!"" Or ""My dad once met bill gates!"" Jesus Christ go get yourself in the newspaper or in the same room as bill gates, get a fucking life.      Am I the only one who thinks she's the girl who played Lydia Bennet in The Lizzie Bennet Diaries?     Condoms, lube, and diapers       Most enjoyable film I've ever seen     I've actually been ordering in bigger portions so that I can use the leftovers for a few meals lol.   We're the Czechs and Slovaks raped by soldiers during its occupation by the nazis?  In school were learning about the Czechoslovakia occupation by the Nazis, and I was wondering if the Nazis had treated the Czechs and Slovaks the same way the soviets had raped the German women when Berlin fell. Obviously the raping would've taken a smaller scale than the 2 million women that were raped in Germany after the war.   We're the Czechs and Slovaks raped and tortured by soldiers? Like what happened to the Germans when the soviets occupied them?  [removed]     That plane in German is flight thing. I nearly fell out my seat laughing in the bus lmao     Eating food. My entire family looks at me like I'm an alien when I claim to be hungry enough to eat an elephant, and then can't even finish my curly fries(which I eat before the wrap). I'm always hungry, but there's just too much, no matter how hard I try. Don't even get me started on trying to diet.      I come from a fairly respectable school, so the biggest ""scandal"" was when we protested against cutting down a tree. We didn't want it cut since we always hung out there and we had ""emotional attachments"" to it. We do, however, have legends. 

Our school takes civics books from the government at the beginning of the year, and returns them at the end. My friend fapped in class, came on the book, and forgot all about it. Shit storm when the government got the book back. 

The second one is my brother. He's known for being a fucking pain in the ass for teachers. This year alone, he's been called out for skipping school every Tuesday, except for the last one. My school has a system where you can't redo a test, but they average your score and apply it to all missing tests. 23/25 on his last test LMAO. In the morning we would go to the cold store and he would buy shit. We had to go to the coordinator of were late so she can mark us in. She's chewing him out about why he was late, all he said was ""spite is good for the stomach"" and went to class.      /r/unexpectedrunescape     I really enjoyed the sex scene. There are some things that I would like to point out though, in the paragraph where he describes her he says ""her wanting eyes, her goddess tits."" The use of tits instead of breasts threw me off balance. The rest of the scene was more of a romantic vibe, but this made it seem like a hook up. 

The line with ""like a metronome in a hypnotist's office."" Sounded extermely forced and out of place. I think that if it were omitted, the reading would've been much better. I don't know what a metronome is, and I don't believe that many people do, all it's doing is making us confused. 

You're doing very well with the build up, at first it was all romantic but took a turn to making me feel uncomfortable. I knew something was off right off the bat, when he said ""what the fuck is wrong with me?"" I assumed this meant that he shouldn't be fucking a friend and felt bad about it. As the scene progressed, it was revealed that it was actually built up feelings to her(I think, I'm slightly lost on what's happening in the previous chapters) 

The build up was good, but the actual sex wasn't. The scene was basically Ruby having sex with someone who was just lying there. Karl also lasted really long, while at the beginning you were describing it as if he was going to cum really quickly. There wasn't any foreplay, which made it much less believable. You kinda skimped over the part where they were undressing, what was she wearing under her shirt? Was she wearing any panties? 

The crying was really weird, I don't know if that's because we missed something since we don't have the entire chapter, it added something to the story, but without any explanation. If you elaborated on why they were crying, it would've flowed much better with the story. 

The end of the scene, after ruby and Karl are done fucking, they say things like ""I'm never gonna leave you baby"" sounded like it's a bad romantic comedy. You could've shown it instead of outright saying it.      What're you gonna say? No? That means you've beaten your wife in the past. Say I've never beaten my wife, sounds like you're denying. The questions is designed to assume your guilt.      Runescape. Trading, patience, integrity, and honor.      Logical fallacies. A logical fallacy is when there's something wrong with an argument. There are 5 types Ima talk about. 

False cause: Correlation doesn't equal causation, or, just because two things happened in sequence, doesn't mean they caused each other. ""Vaccination and autism levels have increased at the same time, therefore, vaccines cause autism."" 

Loaded question: A question that has no right answer. Ex: ""John, when did you stop beating your wife?""

Ad hominem: Attacking the person not the argument. Ex: Person one: ""I think that medical marijuana shouldn't be legal"" person two: ""says the person who was held back last year.""

Bandwagon: Everyone says it's true, so it's true. Ex: a few hundred years ago, everyone thought that sperm was just little human bodies that'll grow into bigger humans until they're birthed. 

Appeal to authority: A person in charge says it's ok, so it's ok. Ex: ""Trump says that all Muslims are bad, and he's the president so he's right.""

     Simpler explanation: it's when you only look at data that's confirming what you already believe, while ignoring data that disproves what you believe. Ex: antivaxers: ""there have been proven increased levels of autism when vaccines have become widespread, thus vaccines cause autism."" If you try to get to the root of the problem, you'll see that the way autism is diagnosed has been altered at around the same time vaccines have become cheaper, so more people will be diagnosed.      Dear Germany, 

You have tried to take over Europe, twice by force and have failed spectacularly. You tried once by peace and look at you now! You have conquered all of mainland Europe and Britain! Well, besides the Swiss.      I find other people to pay for me. There was this trip to Hong Kong about how to protect human rights, school paid in full.      They could have either a weakened dose of the vaccine, or they have a weakened immune system. The virus could still get through with enough exposure, like if they're in Disney land with swarms of tourists.      Nice soviet flag      The infamous Falador mines the grueling work we had to do just to get a bit of coal :(      Because not only their kids are in danger. There has been multiple times when an unvaxed kid spread his disease to vaxed kids. Some things should be forced upon people, and this is one of them as it could spread the disease a lot faster which is what we're trying prevent. Have you ever seen polio? Me neither, thanks to vaccines.      Vaccinations should be a law. There should be an insane penalty for not vaccinating your kids. The antivaxers are only looking at one side of the argument, and completely ignoring another side. People have too much control over their kids tbh.      3rd world doesn't mean anything. Just means that a certain country wasn't aligned with the US or Russia after the Cold War. Bahrain is a 3rd world country, but has the 16th highest GDP in the world.      The mattress business is really weird. Every store in town will claim ""the lowest prices in town!"" Which seems like an obvious lie to snare you in, but it's true. Let's say mattress store 1 buys model A mattress, and so does store 2. Store 1 advertises it as ""cloud mattress 3000"" while store 2 advertises it as ""cloud mattress 4000"". Exact same mattress, different names, different names, lowest price for air mattress 3000 in town.      Yes my sister works at citi and says that it is NOT a good place for an account. It's an international bank and the charges are ridiculous.      From what I know(Shia Islam) you're allowed to pray duhr and asar one after another. When I hear the Duhr athan I pray Duhr then Asar, instead of waiting for the Asar athan. I also do this for mughrib and isha.      Get married islamically, but not officially. That way you are abiding by Allah's laws but you won't lose anything if you get divorced.       I enjoyed a daughter of smoke and bone, the author did a great job with the imagery and the added fantasy was pretty cool. The only thing that annoying is the whole ""the worlds are in danger because of your relationship""     YOLO comes with a pinch of salt. Sure if you can get on a plane to Costa Rica for cheap, go for it. If you've been offered heroien for free, decline. Try to pack your life with the most awesome experiences, and try to have as many of those as possible. That's what YOLO means.      Yea this is so true. The books are a mess if they're full of big words, I always use simple words or use big words with loads of space in between     The hospital maybe?     Probably al3ren     Tinder     Kil 3m wa antum bi5air     Overpriced      The problem with having a collection in Bahrain is that no one sells what you want. The majority of my collection is from abroad that I've gotten from travelling. My advise is that you should look into buying the rocks from online.      There's a good dental hospital in Saar, American mission. It's a bit overpriced but the quality is excellent      I actually just learned this a few months ago. I thought my country was in the Red Sea. I'm 15 and have been taking geography classes since 4th grade Turns out Bahrain is in the straight of Hormuz lol, I'm just glad that i didn't tell anyone about this fuck up. God bless you google maps     Was just thinking about this today, the world isn't set in stone. By world I mean the maps and the rulers. Ex: Russian annexation of Crimea. Fall of Ghadfi. Revolts are still happening, new countries will form and some will come together. Back before WWI, Europe was pretty happy that there were no more wars they said that now peace has come and war is long gone. Then WWI. Then they said it was the war to end all wars. Then WWII, and they said the same thing. 

In a hundred years, they'll talk about that time that America was a republic. Or when Austria and Hungary spilt. The cycle will never end, all empires collapse under their own weight eventually. Play it smart, see who the (probable) winner is, and stick to them. This is the only part of the world which hasn't changed.      I don't get what you mean, mind giving me an example?
     This happened a few minutes ago, and inspired my question. 

Last day in turkey, we bought more than our bags can take. My dad went out and bought 2 huge ass bags to carry our stuff. The bags were full. He bought some stuff to fill up the bags. I had to keep my mouth shut out of respect but mannnnn I was about to explode all over him lol  What was something that was just so impossibly inefficient that you've ever witnessed?       Since you don't ""want"" anything, I highly suggest that you occupy your time rather than waste it. Become a senator or governor. Increase your knowledge, learn a new language. Travel the world. You don't want to do any of those things though, that's the problem. My advice is set for yourself a goal, any goal. Ex: visit ever EU nation. Find a way to accomplish it. Search around online for something that'll occupy you for a good while, and just do it.      Did you whip it hard enough?     Spying  15 [M4A] heyo looking for someone to talk to, my snapchat is subject2840  Intrests:

     subject2840  ELI5: Keeping a bike upright while riding, but when it's stationary, you can never keep it still  [removed]     Stay in Bahrain. Honestly, I don't think my country has any real significance in war. They might bomb us a bit, but I don't think anyone would take the resources to bomb a random tiny middle eastern country when they could be bombing Russia or Germany.      I collect cards. A lot of cards. I might have 30 decks as of right now, from 3 different continents. I've learned a bunch of cool tricks and shuffles that looking fucking epic. Kinda annoys me when I show someone a trick or shuffle that's taken me fucking months to learn and then they're like ""I can do that! Pass it over!"" And then my cards are all over the floor lol      15 guy from Bahrain. I'm into books and games(card and board) and history and politics. subject2840     Leaking from your eyeballs     Throw me to the wolves, I'll return leading the pack with my penis.      I've never been depressed, quite the obvious actually. I've always been a happy person. I found out that I'm content when I'm consuming something(food, a book, games) and happy when around people. So pick up a book. Go out with your friends instead of browsing Reddit.      Why we have 69-74 genders. I think that's the latest number. It just blows my mind that people are endorsing this. If I gave you an apple and an orange, you'll call the apple apple and orange orange. I know that some people find this important to them, just never get it. You got balls? Man. You got boobs? Woman.      Few weeks ago I was in turkey. Guy walks up to me (old man, I'm a teenage boy) asks for a cig. Said I don't have. Stands for a minute. Pulls out a pack of cigs. The fuck? Offers one to me. Now I don't smoke, and I wasn't gonna start then and there. He was insisting for a while and I kept saying no no no. He put it in his mouth and started smoking. I took this as a cue to leave. 

In the moment I was so fucking freaked out. I kept thinking he was gonna rape then kill me. My writing doesn't really convey how fucking scared I was. I thought he put something in the cigs so that it looks normal.      Bit of back info: I have 2 fantasies, one realistic the other is taking over a small country. I would spend hours making plans and shit for my ""invasions"" of neighboring countries and it's just so relaxing thinking that I have the power to enact change. The reason I implied that this fantasy is unrealistic is that my country has a monarchy and it's not something I would want to achieve in another country.      Finally someone with a brain :)     Nestl is such a horrible company. They sent women who has just given birth in poor Africa nations sample that lasted 6 weeks. Just enough time for them to stop producing breast milk. No breast milk guess I have to buy milk from Nestl now.      Hey my snap is kufu1796. I'm not from Britain but I was colonized by you so mabye that counts? M15     Clean air     And you always will be Handsome.      Snowpiercer. Absolute mindfuck. After the climate goes to shit and everything is a frozen wasteland, the remaining humans live on a train that constantly goes around the world. The people on the back of the train are treated like shit, while the ones in the front are treated very well. The entire story is just so beautiful and mind gripping and explains the structure of society so well. The fact that it's so linear, literally and figuratively, was so oddly satisfying.      For a long period of my life, I was like that. I was just drifting through life, not taking charge in what I didn't like about myself. As of now, I'm running, and just took a yoga class yesterday actually(the one where your legs feel like they're on fire). I started writing short pieces of topics that truely interest me. My grand plan is to write a book, start a blog of me traveling to Botswana or The DRC for relive and aid. Eventually settle down, probably do events for my books, and running a non-profit while raising a family. 

Everything I'm doing is contributing to the Bigger picture. One of the favorite things I do is traveling. Now I've found a way to do that while helping people. I highly suggest everyone to find something to work towards. It'll greatly improve the quality of your life.      Me and my friend discuss politics pretty frequently, like just today we were talking about the revival of the Arabian empire and how much of the world's problems would be solved. Then we were talking about the EU and the EEA and how they're just such a mindfuck and different approach to war then what Europe usually does. 

One thing that I really hate is that this one friend of mine is saying everything is a conspiracy theory. ""The Syrian war isn't real, it's just Bashr isn't sucking off America like the rest of the Arabs, he loves his people and he would never chemically bomb them"" sure buddy. The guy next to you who LITERALLY MOVED HERE TO RUN AWAY FROM BASHR is also in on it. Bashr is a fucking Saint. These kinds of people make me want to vomit.     subject2840     Running. I go run because I have too, not because I particularly enjoy it. I wanna run long distances without feeling like shit at the beginning and end.      There are quite a few pictures of the Christmas truce between the Germany and British. This was an unofficial truce, where British soldiers and German soldiers randomly decided to chill and exchange gifts on Christmas on no mans land instead of spending it in a wet hole in the ground.      The current age. We are currently at the most peaceful time, rn most of, if not all, or Europe aren't fighting and are being extermely cooperative with each other( EU, EEA). They've ALWAYS been fighting. Ex: Sweden and Denmark had upwards of 16 wars with each other on a single issue(Norway). Military conflict is also pretty low, they're trying to avoid population centers(sometimes). The most brutal times are in civil wars(Syria)     There was a kind of ""Cold War"" between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Saudi wanted to spread Sunni Islam, and Iran tried to spread Shia Islam. There are two super interesting countries that resulted from this. Bahrain, a Shia majority country with a Sunni Royal family. Oman, the only country in the world that has Ibadi Islam as the most dominant, rather than Shia or Sunni.      subject2840, send me a snap     Listen to the golden age by woodkid, you're gonna lose your mind.      1,500$ for a pair of pants somehow this random white girl who lost her entire fortune and is a waitress, now she says for every 500$ she let someone slap her. Worse thing is she got the cash. And didn't get slapped.       For me reading is like launching a rocket. Getting off the ground is hard af, but once you're ""in the zone"" I can keep going for a few hours. Also, remove yourself for places to get distracted. No phone, no console or computer, just a book. Super great motivator.      I live in the Middle East, and all throughout school, our teacher would flip tf out if we draw a six pointed star. ""WHAT ARE YOU? A JEW? DO YOU SUPPORT ISRAEL?"" I don't agree with them, but the propaganda runs really, really deep. He government ordered, yes, ordered, our school to staple the pages of the holocaust in our history books so that we don't see Jews as humans.      subject2840     Dick

Tf why do parents call their kids this?     2 big things:-

1. Since now texting is our ""normal"" means of
communication, it's what we're used to. Texting is an extermely low level intensity of communication compared to talking. Tl;dr people can text loads but not talk to an actual person. 

2. You can talk to people as far away as Austrialia or America, but you won't talk to your mom or dad because Mr. German guy is texting you. Tl;dr families are drifting apart.      Really changes based on wear. If I see a pretty fat man at McDonald's, I go smh, if I see a guy 3x his size on the road, walking, then I wanna be his friend. He's actively trying to better himself, instead of accepting the rut he's in. True respect for him.      How to do a in the hand riffle shuffle. Takes maybe a day or two to learn, but looks like you're a professional poker dealer at the end lol.      This guy killed the man who raped his 5 year old daughter. People got triggered when he wasn't charged. He shouldn't have been.      Since the majority of people(that I've seen) can't do this, I decided to voice my advice.      Well since I'm an island, I'm gonna make the other countries build walls on their lands that're facing me with their money.      That sounds awesome tbh. Y'all should become the chancellor of Germany and the other the American president. Best way to gain power quick and easy.      You're a great teacher tbh      Bro I'm just naturally good at it     Try to get an honest opinion. Like if you're into drawing, ask for what they DONT like and what needs improvement instead of something where they should say ""oh yea it's good"". That's why I always ask my friends, who're fine with telling me my work ain't good.      When someone says your work is shit? The opposite is also true IMO. Keep at it until you become good, then show them your new, improved work.   LPT: You're not qualified to judge yourself  [removed]     Gills for sure. Imagine just swimming from Russia to America lmfao the look on America's face     The Golden Age. About how the world was a grand and noble place, but has turned to the shit.      Julius ceaser. Release him with an army in Lesotho, watch as he takes over the rest of Africa and Eurasia. He'll be a better leader than any of em tbh.      Damn thanks      Someone who's nice because they can be and not because they have to be. As a male teenager, finding these kinds of people who're my age is extremely hard.      I can make a very convincing sound of a goat. To the point some people in school were freaked that there's a goat in the school not realizing it's a person.      Yemen civil war. People get hyped about over watch but don't give two shits about the masses dying in Yemen.       This right here. I had an anime phase a while ago where I would obsess over it and everyone would be put off by me. It's not like I stopped showering or something, or even stopped other activities that I enjoyed. It's just super annoying how the stigma around it paints it in a bad light. They seem to forget that some of their greatest childhood shows were actually anime. Pokemon? Video game turned anime.      My brother quit smoking for a while because he could vape. The smell of mangos or berries is so much nicer than the smell of a cremation. He would vape those huge clouds alone or with his family/friends. It's a much better alternative to smoking for every party involved. The stigma around it just depresses me tbh.      My sister was telling me of this guy in her gym class who was such a rude shit after he became atheist. He was apparently a pretty nice guy, but now goes out of his way to make sure people feel like shit. ""What's wrong with you and that hijab? You're oppressed and have to ask your dad for everything."" ""You didn't do anything today in class, the only thing that ran was your mouth.""     I've resisted playing actual video games because of this. A good number of my friends are gamers and they're like ""you're a shitty gamer if the only game you play is little big planet"" IMO I offhandedly mentioned I played it, I never said I was a hardcore gamer. Some of my favorite games are really immersive and fun, but are really hated on because it's not about a soldier in a building shooting at other soldiers.      Japan has such a rich history, but the only thing people remember is the anime and hentai. Their society and social structure is so alien to the rest of the world. They're like the only country ever who actually fought to keep their emperor in power. They actually like their rulers, unlike most countries.      The only reason we were able to decode the eygytion hieroglyphics is because of the rosseta stone. There were 3 lines of text, each of a different language. They knew two of the languages, and they both translated into the same thing. They figured out the last line(which was the eygytian hieroglyphics) also has the same translation.      There was a Viking or someone of Nordic descent who battled the invading Saxon/British army for an hour. Alone. He literally fought for an hour against a fully fledged army before he was taken down. Just blows my brains how insane this feat is.      Conservative Jewish schoolgirl     Reek. My poor poor reek :( how can they deface a greyjoy like that? Fucking Ramsey should eat shit and die being pulverized in the penis area.      If you got a good thing going, you want to milk it out for as long as possible. They'll probably make a side story of a charecter, or perhaps they'll take a random event and make a series out of it. Perhaps tywins conquest and how he consolidated the power of house Lannister.      Tywin is loyal as shit to his family. He would never harm a Lannister. I think that he would've held up his bargain, simply because he got what he wanted. Jamie as heir.     Hydrogen started having opinions after sometime.      The world's longest wall is in Australia(suck it trump) to separate Australia into two sides, the human side, and the side that has animals that want to rip your throat.      I don't think so. When we learn history, we're talking about thousands of years. It'll take a hell of a long time for the volume of lessons to increase, unless there's a major war, like WWIII. Unlike before, right now the advancements are spread out over long periods of time, instead of it happening quickly.      I guess we'll be talking about how to updated jail broken iPhones.      Haha yea I'm a bit of a retard when it comes to reddit. Fairly new here.      Not the majority      That's not what happens in my country IMO.

[removed]  The Death/Groove band Grimaze starts EU tour on the 22 april    The Death/Groove metal band Grimaze starts EU tour on 22 april       Mark is missed for his character. Derek is missed for the sake of Meredith. That's the difference between the two of them.     IMO, Ben should've been removed from the residency program. I understand what he means by ""I didn't see the door"" or ""I saw it but I didn't register it"". Nevertheless, a doctor with a good sense of judgement would've estimated that the risk of opening up the patient in the corridor is bigger than taking him up the elevator, especially when the doctor performing the procedure is still learning. And as Miranda said ""6 months IS a special treatment"".     Yes, she has, but she added (as much as I remember) ""I don't make mistakes. At least not like this."" Because Ben's ""mistake"" was huuuuuuge and could've cost him his removal from the residency program.     I agree with you BUT Callie didn't ask for Arizona's opinion because she previously understood Arizona's encouragement to save her relationship with Penny as green light to leave Seattle.     I would bring back George and Mark. They were extremely significant characters for me.     hahaah true dat     OMG YES!!!! I have fear of old age :((     And it's the perfect fit, lucky cat :)     hahahah that was an unexpected ending of the gif :D     I watch/listen to this - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMR5K2QWfJk [Benga   Coki - Night]     ind-heartedness comes out of this dog's eyes 3     hahahaa, I was just going to say that maybe socks are the worst gift I was given as well but then when you think about it a new pair of socks is always in need     Just the fact that you are generalizing in that way speaks very poorly of you. That way foreigners can say the same thing about us: ""They are all haters."" but for example the least thing that I am is a hater. People like you make us look bad! Just because you didn't come across more contemporary thinking people that are above all that hatred and racism doesn't mean they are all like that. You should not generalize.      -    YouLocal       Although most of the stuff you said are correct, I don't understand why do you have to say them in that rude way. You're gonna make the guys regret their decision on moving to Bulgaria. Be nice!     Unfortunately I don't have any idea on village house pricing but I'm sure they are cheaper in the mountain regions in comparison to these in the city. In the villages that I cited live like 1 or 2 English families, no worries, no mini-England. :)     Armageddon     Hi there, I'm from Bulgaria. It's really nice to hear you liked my country so much that you would like to come live here. What I would recommend you'd do first is choose the region where you would like to relocate. Bulgaria has lots of beautiful mountains that are very different one from another and offer different kind of things (climate-wise, livelihood-wise, soil-wise, etc.). The Rhodope mountains are one of the most loved from us Bulgarians. Secondly, I suggest you search on the Internet for articles that tell the stories of other UK people living in Bulgaria because there are lots. I could send you some but they are in Bulgarian. I suppose it would be nice for you to have some fellow Englishman around. For example I know that in NOVO SELO, LIPNITSA, VALTCHEK, PESHTERA, LEVKA, KRUSHETO live English people. And last but not least, check Google Street View just in case - some of the rural places might be on it. Good luck!     /r/WhoLetTheHumansOut     Spice girls - Wannabe     Interesting question. By 'explained' you mean why do they happen or what do they represent? In the first case I'd say they can't be explained - that's why they're called coincidences.

     That's the point...  A whole new level of guitar flipping    A whole new level of guitar flips       This kind of non-speaking weird-gesturing actors always creeped me out. I think I don't like silent movies. :/      This morning I caught myself first checking the weather on my phone and then opening the window to stretch my hand to see what it's actually like out there. :D     I can't decide what says what... So I say ""stop thinking about it, when the time comes you'll know what to do"". It is a cliche but I believe everything has it's own time of happening and if you don't know whether to listen to your heart or your head (supposing that it's not actually the head that's saying both things) then you should give it some more time until a sign comes and guides you to the right answer.     And in each country one person listens to himself announcing the subway stations.     agreed     I believe it was not like this when children had to elaborate a subject and not put circles on tests. IMO it's the test's fault for us becoming lazy and not able to think.     Looking at the big picture - yes, sooner or later you realize that the most important stuff in life you have learnt from... life and not at school but there's one big BUT - it still matters to every employer if you have your university degree or not and your salary will be lower if you don't. There are always exceptions of course but you can't count on that.  THIS IS PURE GENIUS :D    Favorite Mike Patton song/project?

It has facebook-like features like posts and a newsfeeed, but additionally you get things like online jamming, a metronome app and you can give or take lessons - they've got an internal payment and booking system set up. Hit me up there if you like, my profile is Dimuker Hadzhikuker :) And gl with your efforts!     Well I guess YouTube and www.justinguitar.com or www.ultimate-guitar.com are a good place to go. However, you can give www.drooble.com a try too, it's a new and growing community where you can find teachers, post help requests with questions and also jam online (though only 2 people simultaneously, hope they add support for more). Hope that helped :)     For me , this is ableton, this is the architecture sound program so give it a try bro :))     You may add 30% of the sound as samples :))      I write music to get people out of their comfort zone of perceptions, literally my motivation is to get the groove on a song, but essential part is the people who listened to it to say,.. wat df?     get the massive and serum programs :))     FIrst i get catchy pop shit , then i fucking steal a breakcore track and chop the mdf right on it :))) Cactus Erectus - 1400+ followers on soundcloud, the boy with the golden d if you know wat i am sayin     Meshuggah  The Chemical Brothers @ Summer Well Festival [13-14 August, Buftea, Romania]    When you gotta run, but you keep calm instead.

Donation based?     Bad habit is yeah starting new track and saying, for whenever i feel to finish it.. but good one is making tasks , monthly , yearly , and so on, for this year for example i have said to my self to be part of 4 albums with the projects i'm in, and i keep a white board near my desk so i check my tasks every day :))      Have you tried www.drooble.com? Juust sayin ;d     i would say that a simple yet creative video is much more than good lyric video :))      Have you tried to find a teacher on www.drooble.com? There are many producers and musicians with skills     Try lower your voice as you can keeping 1 single note , like chanting , and lift you self up and down with you heels , Elliott Hulse reccomended this :))     Using this mdf and i'm pretty glad with it :)) http://dxbtechnology.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ZOOM-H4NSP-ENG-FIELD-PORTABLE-RECORDER-.-600x600.jpg

So simply play as much as you can, read as much as you can, concentrate as much as you can, and the rest will find it's way :))     Slight distortion on some of the parts :)))     APHEX TWIN .... that's all there is to say      have you tried to write on drooble.com about that? It is something like facebook but specialiazed  for music and musicians :)) Hope that helps     Maybe give it some freshness with a kinky accents and details, so you can be sure , it has your signature in it, if that is your thing :)))     John Zorn - between two worlds, take 5 :))     have you tried advertising this on drooble.com? it's like a facebook but for music and musicians only, good thing it's free, good luck bro     have you tried advertising this on drooble.com? it's like a facebook but for music and musicians only      i am using massive and it's very intuitive but depending on what you what to express of course, for me it's good for atmospheric and similar sounds for creating deeper levels of the composition. But yeah, most importantly like blackandwhite_tk said - FUCK AROUND hahaha     Before sometime i was thinking about how can a musician earn a living without being world-famous. So i figured out that if you have a few projects with which you regularly do something (playing on festivals, organizing events, merch, etc) you can earn a living even without a job, but not in the beggining. So i am now working in a online platform for musicians (drooble.com), 7 days in the weeks,but still am a bassist, drummer and audio-engineer but i don't earn enough money to make a living on those projects, but i am patient ;d     Well, if you want to play that game, i think you should select your primal target group first. Then the different members to be different aspects of the aesthetic? image of the archetypes you represent :)) Good luck
     I use ableton live 8 with axiom 49 and get the samples i love the most on the 8 drum pads of the keyboard, i do breakcore, ambient and experimental in that way. I think e-drums would be nice but yeah, basically if the modul is not expensive enough, you would have to position the midi data manually , which doesn't make much sense, i guess :))  Party mode: ON       Cool, thanks for sharing this :D Wish I could try it out lol     People not judging you because you are not familiar with the political relationships in your country.

Also, I eat a lot of sugar everyday which is bad so having a spoonful of honey in the morning makes me crave less other sweet stuff like chocolate, doughy goodies, etc.  What song do you play in the morning to wake up yourself?

subject2894,"    Me Trying to act like an adult: I think you did a great job. If I was painting myself naked I know wouldn't be able to resist adding a bit of girth and maybe an inch or six. 

I see the shoulders and belly look so well done and natural but I'm just a bit suspect on a couple things that really stand out to me. Either way well done.

The voice in my head: Yep you should paint and post. those are nice t.....female power all day. wonder if she fixed em up a bit, I know I'd add a cup or 2     I used to wear a Saint Christopher on a necklace for years.  Then one morning I woke up and it was off the necklace but the chain was still on and the the pendent and the the little circle piece of metal that connected the pendant was in perfect condition.  No idea still to this day how it came off. 

The main reason I didn't put it back on is because the night it came off was the first night I spent with my GF who had converted to Islam a few years earlier.  In Islam I believe wearing charms is like idols and is considered wrong. I'm not saying anything pro or against any religion but it was far to odd for me.       No prob     I agree it seems irrational. I am still annoyed when someone doesn't stand perfectly still in silence staring at the American flag while the Anthem plays.  The hat question in particular may annoy me because I suspect you know the reason why people remove their hats and I then assume you are showing disrespect to that reason. I believe there is debate on the actual reason we remove our hats, beyond basic respect for the country. I remove mine out of respect for my fellow Veterans and their families both here and passed as an example.

I love my country and a long time ago before I came along people agreed, I believe as a sign of unity, to perform these seemingly irrational actions. It also occurs to me that we as people need more actionable events that remind us of who we are and if you go in a little deeper the great sacrifice so many people made to continue to have the freedom to stand for a moment of peace and listen to our song. 

Thanks for the question. It prompted me to answer it for myself. 

Edit: there to their (I do this daily, never learn)      At my school all the poor kids had a lunch ticket. I grew up in a poor area so poor is sort of relative because at least a 1/3rd of my friends had lunch tickets.  We would sell them for half the full value to kids with money and tell the lunch ladies we lost our ticket. Sometimes you lost that game though and had to figure out another way to get lunch. 

We were maybe a bit poorer than the other poor people but my mom was a hustler and figured things out for the most part. I'm sure she made some sacrifices I'll never know nor will my little guy because of her putting me in every sport and Boy Scouts to make sure I was in a decent place with decent people. She utilized the community well.  Free hot dog after games and if you volunteer to help you generally get the leftovers.

They didn't tell me what to say but when I was talking to the producer it was to go over and help clarify what my thing was going to be. I still could have said anything.  My guess is they cut the camera to another feed and some massive dude crushes you and throws you on the street.      My gf had to move her seat and be a talker.  I was 6th man but they were smart to keep me on the bench.  It was Wendy Williams show. When we were in line waiting to go in they talked to us then we had to write some answers to the topics then we had to talk to a producer with our thing to say.  It was cool, they were all real nice. I'm not sure I'd do it again though because I'm someone that always gets picked out of a crowd for random shit and I'm not sure what I would actually say if I was ever on live TV. I fear I'd black out and attempt to raise an army or something.

I'm guessing you didn't understand what you tried to read.     It happened to me and I didn't do anything. It really didn't bother me other than she was my best friends supposed girl at the time and he caught her luckily. He was with me all night and knew I went to crash and I was wasted and what he caught her trying to do made it obvious I wasn't able to stop her. He's a nice dude even took her home but that was the last I heard about her other than over some beers later to say wtf was that and laugh about it. Good question though. Still doesn't bother me years later. I guess it's different for males when a female is the aggressor and maybe it has to do with the type of aggression and state of mind if the victim.      I compromised in saying we could go in the morning and skip fishing. He could have countered with cash or something but took the first deal. So you may be right I guess...  Back in the day before Reddit  I was at my friends camp in Delaware I think near the Indian river. We were staying in his grandparents camp. 4 dudes in a trailer shape house but I think it was an actual house they called a camp. We got there at night and I slept on the way down. We were in college at the time. Me and my roommate stayed in one room with two twin beds that were on opposite sides of the room. We all went to bed around 1. We were getting up in the morning for some fishing. 

This is where it gets odd. We were both in our bed with the lights off. I was laying with my eyes open and I started to see a gray smokey like figure above my roommates bed. I didn't say a word and really didn't think much of it until my roommate said ""hey *my name* quit f'n around. I remained silent. I stared to get a bit scared. He said my name in a more panicked way and I said ""I'm over here dude"". He then said ""turn on the lights"" I said ""no way I'm not moving"" he then said our friends name and said get the f out of here. This whole time it looked like the smokey figure was kicking at him that was in front of the bed and one was floating above the bed. He jumped out bed and turned on all the lights in the building. He tried to get me to leave right then but I was to tired. We left at 6 am and he didn't enter that room again. I believe he sat in the recliner in the living room all night. I drove home.

Typed this up for another Reddit post and thought I'd drop it here for you all.      No man I was 19 and worried about partying and girls. no one believed us not even our Friend who's camp it was. My buddy and I still bring it up every couple years. We're 34 now.     Yeah. They weren't after me. I left the lights on though and covered my head. I never got out of the bed to my recollection. I was pretty scared      I was at my friends camp in Delaware I think near the Indian river.

Np good luck.      If you don't have a suit go get one from the good will or hustle someone who loves you to hook you up until you can get them back and find a deal somewhere. Darker Gray seems to be the safe color. Where a tie, blue or red but if you are looking in something a bit more trendy purple seems to get some attention. White shirt. Clean dress shoes. Make sure it's all pressed. You can probably hustle all this for cheap. I know I can. Make sure you are cleaned up on your face and hair. Even if you are a trendy person just suck it up and do it. Be yourself after you proof yourself. 

Try to line up some interviews now with companies you can see yourself enjoying the work at. Send your resume and specific cover letter identifying your interest and a few reasons why you are a good fit. Research the company a bit so if you do get an interview you can speak intelligently about their business. If you don't get anything lined up b4 you get there. Make a list of targets and plan to get the first when when they open in the morning. Ask to speak to the HR. If they are available sell yourself. If they are not thank whoever you talked to hand them your cover letter and resume and move on to the next one. 

If you get an offer and you still have more interviews or targets I'd say tell each offer that you are grateful for the offer and you must do due diligence and sleep on it. They should be ok with that and if they are not move on. Keep repeating until you figure a way to sell yourself to a organization that needs something you can offer. 

Good luck

Someone should build these palm oil guys a breathable exoskeleton suit with an electric charge to zap that big ass snake when it wraps around you.      Well done. I couldn't agree more. 1.8 HS GPA here and the whole time I knew I was wasting my time. I had one teacher that agreed and she made a deal with a group us really disruptive guys that she would make us brownies on Friday's if we worked on getting some Microsoft certs. I ended up getting a few certs and ended up in IT and now I've got a 4 word title and CEO's actually call me for advise. Shit still blows my mind when I think about how HS made me feel like I was the dumb failure and now I'm the youngest person I know at my level.       Just my opinion, I think it's the level of intrigue he displays when he says it that could rub some one the wrong way...the big black cock is attached to the scary black man. Not saying Joe is at all a racist or bigot but I hear what this post is about. People can be sensitive about that I'm certain it turns off a portion of the audience but Joe doesn't seem to be looking for mass market appeal so probably the right thing to do is not listen if you don't like it.        34     Male      Both, it depends on the size of the project and type of work.

My long term GF is a former D1 soccer player, driven, beautiful and smarter than me. Sometimes people are rude to her for no reason until I walk up and look them in the eyes. I look hard as f until I see the yellow coward scared little soul. Some people will look right at us and I'll speak and they will turn their heads. Luckily for them my girl is smart and nice and I love her because I'm a person that loves a good fight especially when I have something I'm fighting for. She's used to it. I'm not so it's harder for me to just move on.

I'd say I'm on the privileged side.      Nope. That would make the story less odd though      I was at my friends camp in Delaware I think near the Indian river.

This is a good outlet for those thing I guess.      They can get you in the am. You get woke up to someone on you.      Prob an x-large t-shirt wearer maybe 2 x. BMI in the 50's would've been my guess. I could have easily got her away from me had I not been completely drunk. She maybe had me by a few lbs I was 180-190 range. I'm guessing she was 5'3-5'5.      We did have a few beers but the guy that was letting us stay wanted to get up early and fish. We had plenty I'm surprised he didn't hit them up or leave me there!

Good day, don't be a douche to people that comment on your posts. It's childish.      If that was to me no dude she wasn't but I've consented to worse since...

Listen if you lend yourself to see the lesson you are being taught and humble your heart to the new beginning you will see that you weren't in the right place or right path and this is a season of change. I'm not telling you to go to a church or to do anything but I promise you you won't go through anything you can't handle. You will gain strength and some point in the future someone will come along that you now possess the skills to assist. If you leave us we all loose. Look for the lesson.      And there you have it.      It's tacky to say and it varies but I'll say it's a lot more than I need but not as much as I'd like it to be.      I have answers for you but no time to deliver for you right now. I'll give the quick..1. I don't network well. I'm anti social but my work performance networks for me in a way. Ppl hear who can do stuff and they call. 2. I don't fail because I don't quit. The competition out here is weak. Lots of quitters. 3. No i do the opposite. I ensure the bad ppl get confronted. 4. Ppl play dirty on me. I believe in doing double positive. Meaning if someone e screws me I try my best to accept it and still do something positive for the person or group. Then never work with them again or charge 500% more 5. You have to take the shit work and prove yourself.   What's the latest on the missing children, pizzagate, Wiener saga?

subject2901," An ""Art"" for bellum.io  Hi /u/bellumiogame , I made something for you!

http://imgur.com/LHkUHtG  New ""Profile"" Feature    ""Agar"" a Diep Story, Prologue: ""Liftoff""  Hi guys, let me know if you like these or if I should continue...but these stories will get very cringy, and I know your grandpas can write better and whatnot. Anyway, if you feel like reading this junk, go ahead. Also, this isn't really organized, I just do a stream of thought. So some parts might not make sense, and this plotline probably won't have a climax or anything

---

Somewhere in Diep, two days before launch

...and lets realize that this has been possible thanks to global peace, and that we will continue to seek and achieve further achievements of all diepkind.

---

D.I.E.P., the Diep Interplanetary Exploration Program, launched their biggest ship yet. It launched a Class 3 rocket to kick off the A.C.E., the Agar Colonies and Expedition.

This program was a major step forward for diepkind, and the program was focused on exploring/colonizing the planet Agar. It was a colorful planet that also orbited its star, Zeach. (Zeach was located in the galaxy of Io.) 

The planet orbited Zeach slightly farther out than the planet Diep. Although it had been difficult to collect data from the planet, scientists found out that it had about 73% percent of the mass of Diep.

The rocket consisted of many delicate parts, but its first stage was probably the most famous one. The main booster had 9 Diep International; Generation 4 Type 2 Engines: the DI-4-2.

It also had three very powerful DI-4-1 engines, each capable of a staggering 41,000 Booster Power. The total max thrust possible was a little over 258,000BP. The first stage would take it on a suborbital trajectory, and the second stage would make rendezvou with the mothership waiting in orbit.

The mothership will then take the ship to an Agar-encounter trajectory and rest it in Agar orbit. The 18 tanks would then take three descent ships down and land in different places. 4 tanks will stay onboard.

---

Day of launch	

T-minus 10 minutes...t-minus 5 minutes...fuel feed cutoff...t-minus minute

All systems running nominal, vehicle on internal power...t-minus 30 seconds...

T-minus 10, 9, 8, 7, ignition sequence start...4, 3, 2

(rumbling vibration begins)

...1, zero...

And we have liftoff!  [Bug Glitch] GUI and stuff like that  First of all, you need to add flairs /u/bellumio 

Anyway, sometimes, you can't click on the player menus. Well, you can click, but the individual buttons actually don't work, and the sparkle and blink a lot. I don't know if anyone else has encountered this?

In addition, your allies, requested allies, and pending allies sometimes fail to show up.

I appreciate your effort, DeGhost!

Also...

##addawarningbutton  Any decent ""more planets"" mods out there that work for 1.2?  1.1 is fine too, but I can't find a good mod.  ""Mother"" A diep.io story (kinda)  What I am about to tell you will most likely make a deep impression in your heart.

---

Today I still recall that day.

My mother congratulated me, I was able to take out a pentagon for the first time without anyones help.

However, as I grew up, I started feeling a little rebellious--my mom, a manager, was just getting in my business that she shouldnt be interrupting with.

One day at Diep University, my friends were having such a blast. We had finished all our exams, and what I didnt realize was--this would probably be the most unknowingly best and exciting day of my life. Sorry, cant think of a better way to put it. So I was going back home, I was so tired. Then, before coming into the house, I realized: Well, I havent really cared about my mother in a while

Then a second thought: You know what? I really dont care. She bugs me all the time.

So when I came in, I ignored my mother trying to talk to me and went straight to rest that night. I didnt know that she was feeling so sad and rejected.

The next morning, I couldnt stand the thought that she was in my house, so I just grabbed my two squares for breakfast and dashed out, having evolved into a Tri-angle a few days ago.

Then I joined this famous club called the MG club--I didnt know what it stood for, but all the cool, kind of notorious for bullying, I guess, yeah. They all went there and hung out, and when I joined, I fit in well. Although I thought that what they were doing was wrong, I ignored it, because who cared at that time, honestly?

Then they introduded me this new kind of light drug called crasher fume--it was a version of crasher pieces, chemically modified with barrelium-2. When I started, I hated it. But I kept coming back for more--it was just strangely addicting. Soon enough, I was having up to five packs a day. If I had up to 10 a day, I could faint or even die. But I made sure that it didnt happen.

My FOV, attention span, and bullet accuracy was going down...yet, me and my MG pals wanted to go to Pentagons Field for a little ride. We arrived there, and farmed for several months to get to, yes, level 45, when we could be classified as grownups.

I was so happy being a booster--I was going lightening fast. I think my life was going downhill at that point. Then, a few days later, I hit a maze wall and had to stay in the hospital for a few weeks.

In between each week, I actually started getting my sanity back. I also began to worry about my mom--just slightly in the beginning, but a lot later. I was nervous, and regretted leaving her and making her sad.

It was a few days after I made the decision to go back home and introduce my friends to mom. I was packing my stuff, including a special alpha pentagon souvenir. Then, a friend of mine approached me and told me the following:

Um...hey, something happened.

I replied, Whats going on dude? Lets go for a short race up on that-

No, Oipeid. This is something much bigger and much more serious. I hate to break it to you...but...

But what? Tell me quickly, please.

Okay, Ill say it, your mother has been killed in the recent bosses attack.

This was a joke, I hoped.

Wha-wait...no...

I fainted, and woke up to my friends call.

MOM! ARE YOU THERE? HELLO?

I...I AM SO SORRY. I DONT--I DONT KNOW HOW I CAN...I AM JUST SO SORRY.

Still to this day, I remember that one big moment.

But Im here to tell you this story. Im alive and sane enough--at least I think so--to tell you the story. And to teach you this lesson.

Dont be like me. Dont live the life that I lived. Dont hang out with who you think you are expected to hang out with--make good friends. Make the good friends that will do the right things. Thank your dear loved ones, every day. Appreciate the life and the time you have every day.

Because remember--regret is the worst thing in the world--I know you can do good things in the world.  I just spawned as a level 1 factory in sandbox!  I have screenshot proof if you want.  Guess what happened today?  I was an overseer.

I move about halfway across the map, and repel my drones so that they are going toward the other base but down.

After a long time, I know that my drones are not spawning, so I put my cursor, still right clicking, on the gray border.

My drones got a kill behind the other team's base! I got Level 45 instantly!  Should I release...  my set of MegaProTipsForBellumIo^TM ?

No, seriously, I do have a list of pro tips that will make you much, much better at the game. Let's get this to 7 upvotes to make this happen.

Note: I'm not an upvote hungry guy, I just want to make sure that there are enough people to enjoy this privilege of being a redditor and getting help from the community.  There was a poor tiny base being cornered by 3 other big bases, so I made an alliance.  The little base didn't stand a chance against us four big players!  NEW UPDATE WAS A FEW HOURS AGO! IS THE DEV DEAD? WE NEED UPDATES!!! DIEPIO DEAD  [removed]  [Stupidity Alert] Way to disable CommNet?  Hello, I've been playing KSP since...idk...2015? But I am new to this subreddit. So hello!

I started a worldsave before 1.2 and thus before CommNet. However, I keep looking through the setting yet I cannot find a way to disable CommNet. Also, it's kind of annoying as well, and I am not that good at it.

So I have already started a save, could any kind Kerbonaut here give me a step-by-step tutorial on how to disable that sucker?  You need to add a refresh/exit warning message!  Read the title. Sometimes you either 1. accidentally close out of the tab 2. hit refresh 3. Ctrl + W. Because of this, there have been many glitches such as: 1. losing how many mp you can get by clicking 2. losing all your plots except for bases

So please, make it like diep.io and add a warning message. This would prevent users from accidentally doing this.  Trying some /u/PlatinumPeaks style art with crappy MS Paint skills - Tri-Angle    Greatest Frustration in Diep  First of all...I got spawnkilled many^many times.

Then when I manage to take out a level penta by off-screen luck, I get surrounded by a bullet field of enemies! Then right after I also luckily kill another sprayer!

Then, with the slow clicking and slow upgrade panel pop-ups, I am not able to upgrade and I die.

How great.  This subreddit is ded but  diep.io/#B82A2B5ABB306B6B30E35F  Just Imagine...  An income of 30K mp/s...

100 bases all guarded in thick walls by level 10 plots...

A total cash of 250,000,000 mp...

Yeah stop daydreaming  Exactly 77,777 points!    Really fun build with Octo Tank!  Name yourself ""Sawblade"" and go with this build: 6/7/7/0/3/0/3/7

It creates a semi-strong bullet shield around you that acts as a sawblade cut. It moves fast and has full-on body damage build.

Turn auto fire on and spam-move your cursor on the screen so that the octo tank looks really like a fast-spinning blade.

Do this in Sandbox, won't prove useful in other modes  Project HelpTheDev  We want developments added to the game, and who does that? The developer!

So I've decided to start Project HelpTheDev. Here is how is works:

If you have nothing else better to do and you are bored, disable adblock and go on diep sandbox mode.

Then, spawn, suicide, and click on ad.

Immediately Ctrl+W to close ad tab.

Repeat, you can do up to 10 ads per minute, adding up to 600 ads per minute! If at any given point in time at noon 20 or more are doing it, that is 12000 ads per minute! That's tremendous money!

So go support the developer now!  Master is renamed to Factory, I guess this ensures that the dev is WITH US!  :D  Diep analogy  Overseer is to manager, necromancer is to master  Welcome to /r/jtmsscioly  ;)  A pretty cool game to try out while diep is D.E.D...  Now I've been active on /r/bellumio these days.

Bellum.io is a really fun game, I think it has lots of room for improvement and potential.

Try it out.  Magic    And the AC was sad.    I just got 10,000 score  I can't post images yet, but it was a really good game!

Is Nova or Rov or Jaxx or ETE or QQQ or anyone here?!!!

I literally got 10,000 last minute... my heart was shaking lmao  I tried to clear out all the non-pentagon shapes to make the sandbox basically a mini pentagon nest. This took a while pls gimme claps    This person is the greatest person on the subreddit ;)    This person on reddit is just the worst...no manners, no respect, just insult. Even bad at diep.io...this guy/girl is the biggest fa**ot.    What is wrong with this subreddit    Every Predator ever---seriously, Predator needs a new look. Too much like cake. Credit to /u/Fawful49    I will blow your mind  How to tell which one wins if triple twin and triplet battle

Triple Twin = Triplet Win
tripletwin = tripletwin  Finally a diep.io update  [removed]  I can't handle this.  So many good suggestions.

This includes new gamemodes, new kinds of stats, (ex: invisibility for landmine, bullet power for auto smasher, etc) new classes, changes to sandbox, etc  (Shameless advertisement)  Join a.reconnectmc.com for some real funzies  Why is SK bad and why is RDT bad? Why is there a conflict?  It looks like it's the Russian Revolution all over again  This is my average score nowadays. How about everyone else? I usually don't go for high score, it's more of the killing that is fun.    Why Guardian is best to use as protection and be petted by  Summoner: randomly shoots squares from four sides which may accidentally hit you.

Defender: The auto cannons and traps may hit you.

Fallen Booster: There are a crap ton of bullets, plus you can't chase it well.

Guardian: Only spawns drones from one side, and it is a triangle.  Some good song to play during diep.io. Especially in boss fights!  This really gets my heart going

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ  Anyone else remember the good old days...(comment things like my post content)  ...when the 2-tdm mode had small safe zones?  Waiting for a new update, (2)    Let's just have a fun time!  First of all, please don't just spam dominators, motherships, or ACs... they make the game no fun.

We'll have friendly battles in this server:

diep.io/#24FA9DE3BB30B4F9E29935  So today,  I was a Pentashot (trying it out and comparing it to a spreadshot) almost dominating the server. My name was Soap Noodle if anyone found me.

Then, when I was randomly farming, a small unnamed level 1 tank spawned near my bullet stream and that is exactly where my cursor was. I turned off auto fire to prevent spawnkilling, but it must have tried to get away (it ran out of invincibility).

However, the bullets that did not disappear yet killed him.

I felt so bad.  How to REALLY play diep.io while the updates are lacking    8-bit diep.io    Anyone else, like, think the Booster is CUTE?  I don't know why, but I think the Booster in diep is one of those cutest things that can't be explained of their cuteness.

You know, like it has a round body with the short barrel in the front and the four barrels in the back,

It's like it's a little excited child ready to go somewhere.

The Booster is so cute.  The Overtrapper Is Actually Good.  Let's talk about the Overtrapper. It's mostly a defensive tank. It may seem like a sucky tank to use, but here is why it's good: (And I'm not joking)

1. It has traps are small but can defend you quite well, especially if you are setting up a ""scatter fort"" to defend yourself and block bullets.

2. The traps last a long time, so you can make the defense system quite big.

3. The drones make sure (Like the Hybrid's) that you don't accidentally collide with shapes, attacks low level tanks, etc.

4. It looks cool.

Rest in peace!  So, Zeach gave me the link of the newly hugely updated diep.io. Read for further description.  So yesterday I received a PM from Zeach, telling me that I was one of the five lucky active redditors to receive a link to this. Apparently he didn't want the link to go public, but after a few minutes of thinking I decided to leak it.

The new diep.io ""version"" is so hugely updated, and it includes some of the best additions and changes that we wanted in the game. After playing a little in Sandbox (only mode available for snapshot versions) I decided the community has to see this, it's been so long.

I'm guessing this would be deleted by a moderator soon, but if any of you are reading, please don't delete this.

The link to the new diep.io version is [here](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ).

Enjoy playing it.  Maybe this is why...    THERE ARE OVER A MILLION MG'S!  ...in a kilogram.  What I watched an hour ago    NEW ""SIZE DOES MATTER"" DIEP.IO TANK?!?!?! SUPER LONG BARREL'S MAX PENETRATION!!! 200K+ SCORE?!?! Diep.io Hacks / Mods! (Diep.io game / diepio game)    NEW ""HEX-DECA TANK"" IN DIEP.IO?!?!? EPIC NEW OP TANK!!! 500K+ SCORE!!!! Diep.io Hacks / Mods!    Can someone link me to the list/image of colors that are used in diep.io?  That is because I want to try my best at art~~using MS Paint~~.  Welcome to this subreddit!  Hello!

In this subreddit, we will explore all ~~photoshopped~~ genetically mutated species on diep.io, as well as studying the tanks of diep.io. That, is diepology/diepiology.

Now, what are you waiting for? Put your diepiologist/diepologist hat on and start exploring!  Can someone, like, make an upgrade tree?  Yeah...  #DicksOutForSpikeLaunch  [removed]  Remember when...  Triple Twin was the go-to tank and the ""best"" build was 0/5/0/7/7/7/7/0?  Once you get in, it's impossible to get out...  If you don't have a mine dispenser and you are being followed by a powerful ship as strong as you, there is practically no way to escape it, it is certain death.

I think most people get what I mean, I can't really describe it well but when is happens it is very frustrating.

What is your guys's opinions on this?  [NOT SUGGESTION] Imagine if you...  Got a stat point every 100k. So if you have 1mil points, you would have racked up 43 points.

This post was a short post  Hello!  I'm new to this subreddit, haven't played the game ever but it looks reeee^eeeee^eally interesting. I'm looking forward to playing it.

Is there anything I know? Like diep.io, which stats are prioritiy? FAQ's?

Thanks!  I'm actually...  [removed]  Test (ignore)  1.6mil  The devs of agar.io released this cool new game.  [removed]  How do you flair a post?  I'm dumb.  Anokuu TRIGGERED by ""incorrect"" build    Types of leaderboards  The leaderboards in each server are pretty different and interesting, so I want to sum up some of the types of leaderboards just for fun. Please don't comment that this is totally useless.

Also, assume that by FFA I mean the Maze as well, and by TDM I mean both team modes (4-tdm and 2-tdm).

I did not include Domination, Sandbox, and Tag. (Just doesnt make sense)

[FFA] FFA TOTAL Domination:

1.4mil
45.8k
21.0k
20.8k
12.5k
10.4k
9.8k
8.3k
8.0k
7.6k

Explanation: There is one really good pro who has racked up hundreds of thousands, or even a few million points. This situation is very rare. The first place tank starts dominating the server by killing almost every tank in sight, and the only remaining tanks are a few lv 45 tanks and low-level tanks.

---

[FFA] FFA Domination:

230.3k
56.9k
32.8k
23.3k
21.6k
18.0k
17.3k
15.9k
15.8k
12.3k

Explanation: There is a top tank which has many times as much score as the second place tank. This is common, and rarely develops into TOTAL domination. From the top, the scores drastically dwindle and it shows a gentle curve down the bottom. (Description of looks)

---

[FFA or TDM] Rivalry:

403.3k
398.7k
381.5k
78.0k
67.2k
64.9k
63.9k
45.2k
39.7k
23.6k

Explanation: There may be 2, 3, or even rarely 4 top tanks that are fighting for the top score. The differences of scores between them are usually within 30k, and they rank in terms of score in the hundred thousands. Note that in TDM the top tanks might be in the same team or may be on different teams.

[FFA or TDM] Balanced:

120.4k
109.2k
100.1k
89.9k
87.5k
76.2k
68.9k
63.2k
57.8k
54.4

Explanation: The name may be misleading, but it means that the slope of the scoreboard is very even and there are no drastic changes between ranks. This is most likely to happen (telling from my research) when the server is fairly new, but not too new. For TDM, if this were to be even more balanced, the leaderboard may have a color pattern such as:

RED-BLUE-RED-RED-BLUE-BLUE-RED-BLUE-BLUE-RED (and so on with 4-tdm matches)

---

[FFA or TDM] New:

6.8k
4.2k
4.0k
3.6k
2.9k
2.1k
1.4k
970
305
130

Explanation: This occurs when there is a brand new server, hence not much score from each player and not much competition. Self-explanatory.

---

[TDM] TDM Domination:

450.9k BLUE
389.4k BLUE
302.4k BLUE
106.9k BLUE
56.3k BLUE
49.9k BLUE
47.4 k BLUE
41.4k BLUE
37.7k RED
32.8k BLUE

Explanation: This situation is a pain in the a$$ when you want to do a team turnaround. That is because when the other team has almost filled up the leaderboard guarding 95% of the map, the other team cant farm as many shapes and back at the dominant teams base even more players are thriving and supporting the team. Usually in the top 1 - 5 places, the scores are high.

---

[TDM] After/before turnaround:

450.9k BLUE
389.4k RED
302.4k BLUE
106.9k BLUE
56.3k BLUE
49.9k BLUE
47.4 k BLUE
41.4k BLUE
37.7k RED
32.8k BLUE

Yes, I did copy the score and only changed the team color because Im lazy.

Explanation: This happens after OR before a turnaround, and it is interesting because two explanations are possible:

AFTER a turnaround: The minor color tanks are the ones that survived the big attack from the turning team, which is BLUE in this scenario. They still need to be killed off in order to achieve a turnaround of top 8 - bottom 2.

BEFORE a turnaround: The player that will lead a turnaround is usually the 389.4k RED in this case. The player may rack up high score and killing the other teams tanks until he/she allows some other tanks like 37.7k RED in this example to gain a place on the leaderboard.

  They removed X-Hunter!!!  So they basically combined the Predator and the X-Hunter, so that the Predator now has 3 barrels. It keeps its zoom ability.

P.S.: I'm sending this with Internet Explorer, might be a little late  Almost thought this was about 2b2t holy shit.    Fit becomes STAFF of RUSHER'S SERVER?!?!?!!?? (GONE WRONG) (GONE PRESIDENTIAL)    Why Anokuu is called Anokuu  She plays as necromancer. Then other players underestimated the necromancer at first and Anokuu started beating then and they said

AAAAAAAAAAAA

and some people said

NOOOOOOOOO

and when she defeated all of them they said

KUUUUUdos to you m8  Whenever there is a new gamemode  I got 1k score with basic tank.

GIMME WR  PLEASE ADD ABILITY TO LIMIT CLASSES IN SANDBOX AND MORE OPTIMIZATIONS!  For example, the owner should be able to kick players or spawn in shapes and bosses.

Also there is always this one fuckhead to goes AC and does not follow rules.  QUICK! I NEED A RESPONSE FASSSST  Did MoneyShit AKA MiniClip buy diep.io?  [HELP] Can someone explain 2b2t now?  So how do I start... Oh

You know, did the Rusher war end? Fit is a lost cause, and who is he teaming up with, where did they come from and what are they called?

What is the conflict nowadays?

What's going on?

Is autism spreading further?

Someone clarify current events please.  These are NOT diep.io hacks.    TIP - when the arena closes:  1. Press F5 ASAP and press Enter to refresh the page

2. Join any gamemode ASAP

3. You are almost first in that server, if you are gud you will be able to control the new server.

4. Profit  So today as a level 16 tank I got an off-screen lv 45 kill...  and it felt good.  I predicted the future.  20 days ago I posted something that complained about how so many ftb spam tanks wee in this subreddit.

So I said something like ""Do we need /r/diepioftb or something!?!""

But that subreddit is now 19 days old.

Possibilities:

The maker of the subreddit took my idea.

Or, it's a PURE coincidence. But if I took part, I feel proud.  Have some lethal dose of clan cancer.

ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK, ALL 676 COMBINATIONS OF ALPHABETICAL COMBINATIONS FOR CLAN NAMES! Credit to /u/Blo-_- FOR THE IDEA.  [removed]  PLEASE! WE NEED THE ABILITY TO BE SANDBOX ADMINS SO WE CAN DISABLE/BAN CERTAIN CLASSES AND KICK PEOPLE OUT!  [removed]  Anokuu EXPOSED in Windows 10?    FIT EXPOSED IN GOOGLE DOCS!    I hate it when I get teamed on and bombarded by two bullet spammers from two sides.  ;(  Spread Shot vs Triplet. Build both 0/0/0/7/7/7/7/5. Who wins?  I'll be doing more of these.  VERY fun story (stress relief)  Hello.

So I spawned in as ""Fighter Pilot"" to play as Fighter.

When I was not even level 15, I kill a triplet by 110% luck. The triplet, fighting with another bullet spammer, had very low health.

So I immediately upgrade to Fighter and choose the build 3/3/0/4/6/6/7/4.

As soon as I do that, a pentashot starts a fight with me. I hit a few shots, get away, hit a few shots, get away. The best shots land when the pentashot uses its vulnerable back to boost towards me with the recoil.

Since I have regen and a ton of health, my health build is pretty solid. I get the pentashot down to SERIOUSLY low health when he/she escapes. I was like ""damn it""

And there is this overtrapper, and again, I take down a little of the player's health at a time when the same pentashot (now full health) comes at the two of us.

Taking much damage from the traps, the pentashot gets down to SERIOUSLY low health, again. Then I take the chance, while they are distracted, to one-shot kill the pentashot. My rear bullet also kills the overtrapper.

So obviously, I was very happy and excited! Right after, I get in a fight with the quad tank, and trust me quad tanks are slightly underrated.

The quad tank was a very experienced player and it almost got me. Then I run away to regen, when the pentashot I killed with the same name ""astro"" comes as a rammer basic tank and kills me.

...then while he is regenerating, I quickly respawn and conveniently spawn close to the player.

;)  Bored?  [removed]  WHAT IS THIS? The text is yellow, I joined from another browser with the party link.    I don't have a backslash on my keyboard  ;(  The subreddit right now    Wait... the sandbox thing is super hype but I can't join it for some reason.    My reaction to the new buttons update and sandbox. Dev, thank you you are a god.    A great new game!  [removed]  When your team does a turnaround and saves a stupid rammer    So... is auto fire on or off? I'm pretty sure I turned it on... (not photoshopped)    Build mistake  I was going for a glass cannon build with the triplet.

I was about to do M+8 for movement speed but my hand slipped and the game put all points in body damage.

Fml.  Almost untouchable... and yes I am using the same name.    Does anyone else spectate the tank that killed you?  I do, even if it lasts for tens of minutes. I watch for two reasons:

1. It's entertaining, almost like watching AI fight.
2. I just wanna see that bitch die.  FFS!  Do we need another god damned subreddit called /r/diepioftb or something? There are way too many STUPID tanks (some are good though) spamming this subreddit right now!  Fun story with Spread Shot (It's fucking underrated, btw. Ok maybe not underrated but OP if you're good.)  First off, build: 0/7/0/5/7/7/7/0 (The health and bullet speed help a lot, you'll see)

And my name in-game, ""Soap Noodle"".

So I enter the server, then I chose twin. Then I choose Qua-no, accidentally the Triple Shot. So I farm until I get to 45, then I choose Pen-no, Spread Shot. So I was like ""shit.""

I didn't know Spread Shot was so good.

First, it's the perfect counter to rammers. And many others. This story contains some fun material, it may have annoyed the players but it was a hella fun for me. Here it is:

You don't have to be aggressive or anything. Just be frank. He'll either come down on the price or you can buy one from someone else.     It totally looks like sim city when you zoom in.     I would maybe just call it ""compact"" instead.     Woah! Are you celebrating something, or did you get a discount? Those things aren't cheap.  [NPD] Malekko Helium MkII so far, so great       TC Electronic Shaker... I think     Fuuuuughhhh... waaaannnnnt!     I've never played a Klon, but I've tried the Soul Food and the Archer with the same amp and guitar and the Soul Food sounded harsh and noisy compared to the Archer. Maybe it was a fluke? It's obviously subjective, but I thought I heard a pretty substantial difference.     I think the Archer beats the Soul Food by a mile.     Damn, I'm a little envious of that distort knob on the Throne Room, I've never seen that one before.     If you're talking about the small, older Semaphore, I have one and it's cool, but I ended up getting a Diamond Tremolo (tried it against the Empress first too and thought it sounded better) because of the tap tempo, subdivisions and the double tempo hold button thing. If you're talking about the bigger semaphore with tap tempo, nevermind (except for the double time hold feature). 

I know I've already posted about it, but the Uverbia is crazy good. Just want to reiterate that. I've also been using it as a distortion pedal on some recordings and it sounds so cool.     I would prefer not to be burned. I'm not saying they're good (or original) just that they're popular, which could be lucrative if you're starting a business.      Diamond makes some really good stuff. Also, Malekko, Catalinbread, Empress, Earthquaker, Subdecay... Walrus Audio, JHS, and OBNE are getting a good bit of attention.     J Rockett Archer (Klone)
ScreaminFX Uverbia spring reverb
and my RE-201 Space Echo if that counts... 

if not, either the Empress Vintage Modified Superdelay for its versatility or the Analog Man ARDX20 for its... I don't even know what it is... magic maybe?     I'm really into it. Haven't quite figured out how to fit it on the board yet (which pedals to boot off), but if I can't do it I'll just end up setting it to the left or maybe even near the amp. It's something I'm probably going to leave on most of the time while I'm playing so I don't need super quick access to it.     Just posted a video demo here --- https://youtu.be/Jfn-o_vJdB0  [NPD] video demo of ScreaminFx Uverbia real spring reverb pedal       It has a 3 spring MOD tank inside of it and a bunch of other stuff relating to the gain structure. I'm going to record a demo either later today or tomorrow.     You are correct! There's also an output driver inside the enclosure that can do some pretty fuzzy things to the signal making it a great pedal for psych stuff.     The Digiverb is just for scale.  NPD ScreaminFX Uverbia spring reverb pedal... I've been playing with this for about 15 minutes and it sounds amazing       Analogman ardx20 is badass! It does a great job of not getting in the way of the signal and also has an fx loop allowing for a lot of extra flexibility.      I got the black fountain recently... it just wasn't exactly what I was expecting and I ended up finding a good deal on the empress vintage modified superdelay on Craigslist so it got on the board instead. 

Diamond is badass! They're also really pleasant to interact with. That tremolo has got some magic in it too.     It's pretty cool! Has a ton of different effects. Really unique. Some of them are totally usable and others are completely  bonkers. I never really use it because it's a desktop unit though.     I believe direct is the left channel/mono, so it's the one to use if you're playing with one amp.     The diamond tremolo is amazing. You might be able to find one used for a good price.     You should try putting a dummy cable out of the second output (right) on your boss super chorus. Some stereo chorus pedals will send out vibrato in one channel if you trick it into thinking it's putting out a stereo signal. That should make it more wobbly sounding.     Yeah! The colors on that one are especially cool too.     I just got an Archer a couple of weeks ago! It's working out pretty well so far. How do you like it?

I hope you look like this though  cutoffs        This thread is down vote central. Wha' happened?     You might want to play shittier gear if you want people to give you money...     I read that it was a yamaha e1010.     That's a darwin fish also.     Yes! Done!     Yeah, I got lucky. It's rare, but sometimes happens. I got my Analog Man ARDX20 delay from guitar center in perfect condition for $200 a little while back... certainly not the steal of the century, but a pretty decent deal nonetheless (plus you can return it if you don't end up liking/using it). Just gotta keep those eyes peeled... and check in multiple times a month like a weirdo who only comes into the store for about 90 seconds, stares at the used case and then leaves.     If you hook up two of them (I already had one), you can use one as a stop/tap tempo/clear phrase button, and the other to scroll up and down through the different loops and select the next one while you're playing.     I had the same dilemma today actually. Ended up getting the boss because I got it at a good price and I've read a lot of horror stories about digitech's software when it comes to loading tracks onto the looper from a computer.  [NPD] Boss RC-3 Looping Pedal - got used it in pristine condition from Sam Ash for $100. Prettttaaay, prettttaaaay, pretttaayy good.       God, I hope so.     I think you're just talking about a multitap delay. I believe there are settings for multitap on a lot of different digital delays.     You should get a vox pathfinder 15r. They sound so good at bedroom volumes and can get much louder. The tremolo is really nice sounding and they are super cheap. I like them so much that I have 3 of them.     The digiverb is super underrated.      For me, the ardx20 and diamond tremolo do just what I want. Everything else I kind of sub in and out.     Hahahahaha   Why has no one made a horror/christmas movie called Monster Claus?       I have that same color scheme! Love the tilt eq.     Oh man, I've had my eye on that skreddy echo for a while now. I'm assuming you're happy with it?     I think it's more the purview of the semantics police.     Yeah. I won't be doing that again.     Context: I asked my girlfriend if she meant to say she ""listened"" to two books on tape last month when she said she ""read"" two books last month. Arguing ensued. She is pretty upset.  Do you think it's ok to say you read a book when you actually listened to it?       The Diamond Tremolo is definitely worth checking out.     I was really excited to get a black fountain, and was super underwhelmed after I got it. The one setting that I really liked (vintage), I wasn't able to blend properly. The volume would jump really fast from not being there at all to being too loud. Also, the modulation was nothing special. I think I was just expecting too much. They just look so cool and those knobs videos make me want to buy every pedal they demo.     Also, everybody(close friends, family and girlfriend who I live with) responded in a caring and supportive way when I told them. It was a relief to know what the problem was and helped explain my odd bathroom schedule.     I got diagnosed in January. My case was severe, but besides being on prednisone twice the main thing that has helped me has been good probiotics (vsl #3) and apriso. I mostly stopped eating junk food, spicy food, and food from taco trucks and stopped drinking soda. I also avoid liquor for the most part. Don't be too freaked out and listen to your doctor.     Analogman ardx20. Ohhhh weee.     I think Mac Demarco uses a Yamaha E1010. It's not a pedal, but it's what I've heard.  I wonder if 50 year old me will think I'm as much of a dumbass as 30 year old me thinks 20 year old me was.       Looks like an ehx micro pog.     It seems to be overlooked a lot, but I actually like the Digitech Digiverb. It does a lot of fun stuff... I belive it goes 100% wet too.     I used to do that! Sold it and got a JHS emperor... which I honestly didn't like all that much... and then sold.

Anyway, that tone knob on the ce5 is great.  WHAT THE FU - - - oh nevermind    WHAT THE FU - - - oh nevermind    Truly He is the Nap King       Headroom and dynamics  Look at This Crazy Beast        Dig! is badass     I won't downvote you for that... maybe just close your eyes?  Teaser for a new crazy glitchy pedal from Malekko. I'm definitely liking the weirdness.       And sample rate reducer. Also has a crazy filter on it.     *its  [NPD] Malekko Scrutator: What does it's name mean? I have no idea. Do I like it? Yes.       Downvotes be damned!     I's juss jokin' around. 

Seriously though, if you find this pedal, please let me know. Vibraphones are magical.     Buy a vibraphone and put it in a guitar costume.     He may not have pants, but he's right.  Hey! Look over here!    Hey! Look over here!       Also, a space echo is ALWAYS a good investment.     I believe Lovetone pedals are pretty much all over $500.     Empress vintage modified superdelay $449     Diamond $249     ""Crazy feminist gets arrested"" is a bullshit title. This is just a crazy person. Feminism has nothing to do with what happened. It does make me curious about how I can get free inhabitant status though...      I have the digitech digidelay and the dd5. To me the digidelay does it a little better.     I'm not familiar with the white atom. Have you made a decision yet?     I didn't think deals like that even happened anymore. Congrats! You made out like a bandit.  Have been [GAS]ing pretty hard for a phaser...  And found a Maestro MP-1 today for $100! I can't take it home from the shop for a couple of weeks because of used merchandise laws in my county, but I'm super excited. It's the only phaser I've used that immediately spoke to me. It sounds so detailed and full but not over the top. Plus you can control the speed and depth with your feet! The same shop has a Maxon ph-350 and a stage phaser both priced really well. Anyway, just sharing my excitement. I'm itching to take this thing home. 

As you were, pedal friends.     Execution via pelican has to be one of the worst ways to go...  the happiest dog    ITAP of a hotel room       Thanks! Yeah I took it a couple of weeks ago with a Galaxy S6.  The Hotel Room       There is no jhs on that board. It's a throne room.     Did you get the 1024?     Keep them close to your heart.     Diamond, Malekko and Analogman are all super solid. I've been wanting to check out Mr. Black, Dr. Scientist and Chase Bliss also.     Many kudos to you, good sir. All of the kudos.  [NPD] Malekko Fetish Analog Field-Effect Distortion, I gigged with this last night at Largo and I gotta say it reaaaally hit the spot. Two thumbs as far up as they can go.    Definitely one of the more specific warnings I've seen...       There needs to be a PSA on /r/guitarpedals about when to use the word ""humble"". It would prevent a lot of arguing.     When I'm recording, if I'm trying to accomplish what I think you're talking about, I run my guitar through an re 201 space echo first. Overloading the mic input sounds pretty great. The echo you can have on or off. Also it's possible to plug your guitar into the PA input and get only the wet signal into your daw. If you turn the repeats all the way down and turn up the speed as fast as it will go in mode 1 the latency is manageable.     Keeley just came out with a pedal... I think it's called the 30 ms double tracker. Check it out. The demo I watched sounded great.     You did too... on purpose maybe?      I can't say enough good things about the diamond tremolo. Best sounding to my ears and very tweakable in a usable way.     Mine is the empress vintage modified superdelay. It's not my favorite but it's very versatile and sounds good. Hasn't been booted from my board yet. That and the Meet Maude are my two delays currently in use. Meet Maude is my preference for sure.     I have 2 that I've already paid for coming my way and neither has shipped yet. Patience is definitely the name of the game.     Had one a while ago and ended up selling it. I could never get behind the actual distortion so I really just ended up using it for the ""feedback"" a couple of times for recording. I like the freeze more for that kind of use, especially live.  Did a personal inventory today while working on my resume       The diamond compressor is super high quality and very easy to use. It also has a built in tilt eq that is very handy for cutting through the mix in a live band situation.     Oh yes.     You got it.     Duesenberg starplayer special -- diamond comp -- archer -- meet Maude -- universal audio Apollo -- pro tools 11 -- native instruments guitar rig (fender black face amp)

There were other pedals in between but they weren't engaged. 

Would've used my real supro or vox, but didn't want to wake the girlfriend. Also, guitar rig sounds surprisingly good. I use it on recordings all the time, especially when I'm working late at night. It beats the shit out of the Waves guitar amp plugin.     I couldn't find them for sale anywhere yet. Am I missing something?     Oh man, fender blenders can get naaaaaasty. I used to play in a band with a guy who had one and it felt like someone was shoving a pencil in my ear we he turned it on.  Fairfield Circuitry Meet Maude Demo (audio only)       https://soundcloud.com/subject2923/meet-maude-demo     I paid a little more than that for mine($195 American including shipping), so I would say that's a good deal. I just posted a quick demo if you want to see what it sounds like --- https://soundcloud.com/subject2923/meet-maude-demo     Just made a quick mess around demo here ----- https://soundcloud.com/subject2923/meet-maude-demo     It's a really dark and gooey analog delay with switchable randomized modulation ( off/a little/a lot) and a built in compressor (a little/a lot) and it just sounds amazing. It's honestly what I was hoping the black fountain would be. That's not a dig on the black fountain. There is $100 difference in the prices, so there (ideally) should be more features. It feels a little more alive than my other pedals, and it has this thing I've never experienced in a delay where if you crank the feedback and play, it goes on and on and gets murky and crazy, but if you hit another note or chord it kind of ducks the soupy glue and will follow what you are doing (I'm assuming the compressor is doing this). I had it cranked to almost 100% wet and was doing that with the modulation turned on and I started feeling a very pleasant, soft wooziness drift over me. 

Anyway, I've been with it for about an hour now and I have to say I'm extremely satisfied. It also has a tone control and an fx loop and can be controlled by cv (though not at the same time).

It can do short delays and relatively normal stuff well too.      eschew obfuscation     (that's a good thing)  [NPD] Meet Maude, the first pedal to ever make me feel like I'm straight up on drugs       The zeta design is really cool.     I'm not listening to it right now, but I feel like there's a slow kind of deep phaser on the guitar too.  Wednesday got me like    Wednesday got me like       I don't know, but here's a cheesy pun off the top of my head:
""It's just a phase""     I know the moogerfooger is way more tweakable, but I can't see how anything could sound that much better than this one. I really love the foot controls and the general design of it too.  NPD '70s Maestro MP-1 Phaser (designed by Bob Moog) It sounds like god is chewing on my guitar.       I see what you did there! Fender... Champ... Eh? Uh? Yeaaaah.     Drone Zone     What's the question?  I have yet to play with any Rainger FX, but this seems like it could be verrrry fun... and super annoying to my girlfriend and pets.    Happy annoy your cat day!       Ahhh, I probably just haven't noticed the others because I don't check them as obsess... uhh I mean frequently.  Why does r/guitarpedals disappear and then reappear somewhat frequently from the ""my subreddits"" dropdown menu? Is this only happening to me?       Roland space echo... echo... echo
201, baby     I think this is probably Richard Swift's studio.     I don't believe so, unless you've modified yours somehow.     I talked to Paul Barker (the malekko dude) the other day and he said their new pedal platform is going to allow for a lot more crazy shit like this in the future. I think so far it's the scrutator and this one.       I do! I've only been playing with the pedals for an hour or so, so I still have a lot of experimenting to do, but so far it's super tweakable with a good variety of sounds, most of which are pretty great. The drive sounds surprisingly good too.     Definite Moogerfooger in there, but I don't know which one.  [NPD] x 2/Shaking with excitment/Apparently there's a blue Wizard of Pitch       I highly recommend the Diamond Compressor. It's super simple, sounds like a legit rackmount compressor (very high quality) and works well as a preamp too. Also, the tilt eq is faaaantastic for sculpting your tone.     I can't help but notice that your board is made of carpet. Custom job?     The best barometer for gear prices is sold items in eBay.     That is of you want a gooey dark analog delay (plus a bunch of other options in the case of meet maude).     Not particularly. Meet Maude is exponentially better imo.     I had really high hopes for it and then some serious issues with the blend/delay level. Could never get it to sit right. I think I remember much more distortion than I was anticipating also.     ehx microsynth

https://youtu.be/NLI9NR07PW0

just for you     Yep! It's the mode that lets you tune the repeats when you are using the pedal as intended.     If you plug it into itself in manual mode you get a tuneable oscillator. Pretttty, pretttty, pretttty good.     So far I've mostly been messing with mode 1. I'll run a tone into it from the wurlitzer to the freeze, give it some stutters with the foxtrot, then use the ct5 to add 5ths and octaves by messing with the direction smooth all of that out a little with the fairfield. The length knob is great in this situation too, especially when you want to change the tempo by shortening or lengthening the fragments.     I like it a lot so far. I'm pretty much just using it to add a little randomness/texture to the droney stuff that's coming out of the freeze. Haven't really gotten into the pitch aspect of it yet but I'm sure that will be fun.     Dude! That video just sent me down a 20 minute youtube whole of looking at Electro Lobotomy instruments. So cool...

As far as instruments go, guitar is my main one, but I've been using a good bit of this cool old Wurlitzer electric piano I got pretty recently --- http://i.imgur.com/lDsnKBV.jpg , a decent amount of autoharp (mostly backwards so far), bass, mangled drums, vocals... I'm probably going to get more into noise territory for dream sequences and stuff so I'm sure I'll be adding more weird/unconventional instruments and samples for that.     Wonderyak got it. Thanks so much!     Correct! And it's amazing.      Thanks a lot! It's always refreshing to interact with cool, supportive people online.     Yeah! I'm so excited. The director/producer/writer is someone I met in the first year or so that I moved to LA (been here for 5 and a half years doing various music things). I did some music for a short he made last year and he's seen me play shows and heard my music. He wrote a really good script and got it to the lead actress. She signed on and helped him wrangle more people. He then enlisted me as a kind of consultant to help with a song they perform in the movie and I told him I would love to write some original music for the movie if possible, and pretty quickly that turned into me being the composer. Soooo, time + work + luck?     http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5198796/  Scoring a movie   these 4 have been an invaluable combo when pure dreaminess is called for.

Also, the alesis bitrman. I love that crazy thing. Oh, it's not exactly a pedal but I have this insane sounding spring reverb made by a company called Monacor. They were based in the US, but I have the German version for some reason.       Yeah... that's exactly my point.

Let me know if you have any questions. I'm open to interesting trades.     Thanks so much! I was kind of experimenting on this one, singing mostly in falsetto with a droney melody in kind of a weird rhythm and when I was mixing I definitely noticed the Kevin Parker influence (and a little Panda Bear). It's funny how that stuff seeps in. I love Currents, btw.  Surreal/Dream Pop song I wrote and recorded yesterday. Thoughts?    Surreal/Dream Pop song I wrote and recorded yesterday    Meat and Potatoes    Biv, Roy G       Yep! The switch on the left is the on/off for the pedal and the one on the right is the on/off for the photocell theramin.     Please post videos of you operating the Ipad with your foot.      I got the jupiter 3 very recently and posted about it on here.  Super fun synth that you can trigger with any audio source. Also talked to the guy who makes them and apparently it's just something he does in his down time. They are made in super small batches and very infrequently and he's not interested in scaling up.      Is that Pick Cage I see?      DS-1 and TR-2 are both super sub par     There's actually one for sale for $250 in LA at Caveman Vintage Music (where I saw it in the first place and got obsessed with it). I don't know if they ship, but they might put it on Reverb or something if you message them.     my hand clicked purchase right as my mouth said ""you cannot buy another pedal""     done did it     If you want to hear it (not a full demo by any means, just one cool setting and chord progression I made up on the spot) with the settings from the photo
-----  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR7KSuQNyl0  [NPD] Mid-Fi Electronics Deluxe Pitch Pirate (feeling pleasantly woozy)       Yeah... I don't know how new it would be. There was a good bit of space oriented music in the 50s (pop), 60s (psych), 70s (psych, pop and prog, especially prog), etc... 

That being said, I am TOTALLY down for a more concentrated space music genre.      Bravo, sir! I've only heard tell of the KoT, but I had an ARDX20 and they are stupendous. Way to circumvent that insane waiting list!     I have also napped in my car on occasion... again, that's why this case is a nap goal.      I would think ""Wow!  What is the likelihood that I would find a photo of my dad napping in public on reddit"".      I'm not making fun of him. I wish I was uninhibited enough to nap in public... aka nap goals. Things can be funny without being made fun of.     That's quite an assumption to make. Even if that's the case, I still think it's funny to do it in a donut shop.  #napgoals       You can plug any audio source into it and it triggers the synth, or you can hit it (it has a pickup inside). Also: photocell theramin to control the pitch. I plugged a crappy yamaha dd-9 I've had since I was a kid into it and messed around with the pitch knobs. Everything sounded like funky old video game music. Started messing with the sweep, modulation and decay and it sounded like rototoms played in space. I couldn't be any happier.  tired and terrifying       I didn't even say the make and model in the title... whoops! It's a Chamber of Sounds Jupiter III.     Aesthetically, it is very well done, but I think that more graphic oriented pedals tend to sell better in the current market. That's just my opinion, mind you, but something to consider in the future. The eq is a good idea though, for sure!  [NPD] 365 Million Miles Away From Earth (not a traditional guitar pedal, but one that can be triggered by guitar and one that experimental guitars players will no doubt appreciate) + it looks amazing       Fletcher Munson! Never forget.      Also, the digiverb goes 100% wet and those x series pedals are nearly indestructible. I'm now going to stop talking about it and go play with it instead.     I love the Digitech Digiverb. Have had it for and used it on recordings and live for years. Many other high end pedals have come and gone, but funnily enough this one stuck around. Coincidentally, the digidelay is super flexible and fun too. I'm sure you can find both of them for very cheap on craigslist, ebay, or reverb.      That old grey mxr 117 has a wide array of cool and insane sounds.      Not sure... I haven't seen any announcements about it or anything.     I got it direct from Dwarfcraft.     I was so excited by the new pedals that I spelled ""excitement"" wrong and didn't notice until 11 hours later.     Either a dream or a very pleasant hallucination. Definitely what I was looking for.      Thanks!  hay            Idk            the drool    Feeling the drool    weekend plans complete with food stain    my weekend plans complete with food stain    Was just gifted this MTI Auto-Orchestra drum machine/bass synth.

Also, I'm looking for the pedals that control the chord changes. Thanks!    Anybody know a good place in LA to get an MTI Auto Orchestra worked on? I'm also in the market for the pedals that work the bass section. Thanks!       I'd look up my bank account. Maybe I would actually have some money from the interest accrued.

     If you have pro tools I guess the easiest way would be to import the songs and normalize them all... But you're probably dealing with perceived loudness because of more aggressive limiting and compression in modern music too which would mean you would need to squash your old tracks. That's kind of complicated and would probably sound like shit. 

For the non technical approach, you could group them in your playlist according to loudness and just go adjust the volume whenever you know the next group is about to start playing.     I wouldn't call this prog rock... I love ELO, and consider them to be a straight up pop band, just a really really good one.     Whammy the shit out of the volca! Make a loop of it with the infinity. Play that backwards (I think it does that?) and move the whammy after the infinity in the chain whereupon that loop will be whammied the shit out of again. Make a loop of that with a ditto, then run that through what I'm hoping (but not sure) is a moog ring mod.  Loop that with another ditto and gently rock yourself to sleep .     Sold it last night. Sorry. I'll take this down.     Cr 68 for 300 is INSANE     That's all I ask.     I've been looking at those! Currently have a TR-66 on the way and thinking about getting a univox sr 55. The TR-606 will probably be acquired pretty soon though.     Oh shit! Yeah, that definitely sounds right. They're using that delete knob a lot to pull stuff in and out.     I would buy the 32 if you still had it.     The space drum function, that is. The rest of it sounds pretty great.     That's how I found out about it! Now I'm on a vintage drum machine  kick...     Standard leaves all of the instruments in, wood block takes out the wood block, so on and so forth...     It sounds like a cartoon version of a rototom.     I just heard about it a couple of months ago and was able to find it pretty easily. That may have been luck of the draw though.  Ceci n'est pas une guitar pedal       Will do      Nope. Los Angeles.     It's cool! I got a good deal on it so I'm probably going to flip it as I have most of my delay needs in the studio covered by my Meet Maude, space echo, Yamaha e1010 and effectron.      What are your top 5 out of the 40 you've owned?     The blue sounds very nice, but I've never tried the red. I've read a decent amount about both and it seems to be about an equal split as far as people's preferences go.     I like Diamond as a company. They make great sounding pedals that are really well built (I have the comp and the trem too). The vibrato is one that I've wanted for a while. It has just enough features to be fun and tweakable but not so many that it's overwhelming to use.

subject2947,"    1 nerf in months woo, lets all wait another 4-5 months for the next weapon balance Lol...     Social engineer? Doesn't take a genius to manipulate 13/14 yr olds Lol...     I trust the devs that they would accurately buff/nerf weapons, They would most likely do some testing with it first, to see what works. 
I dont necessarily agree with the ruining other peoples builds, as the majority of builds would stay strong even after weapon updates. Its just nice to add color to the pvp side of the game is all.   When will we see much needed weapon balancing? pvp is dying.  I Remember this was talked about in the osrs streams awhile back about buffing the acb special attack, and some other weapons.

The Current meta right now for pures is ballista to gmaul which is extremely broken.
It also gets quite boring having the exact same meta for a very long time. 

Would love to see the meta change by buffing some weapons like the acb, dragon longsword, dragon mace.

Its not to say that they dont do weapon balancing, but they come very frugally, I Remember they buffed the crystal halbard, buffed the abyssal dagger special attack, And nerfed the blowpipe speed. 

But other than those 3 its been a very long time since they have changed up weapon stats which is why i feel the wilderness is dying a bit.

Post your thoughts.     Found the name buyer/seller     God you're fat as fuck      Thnx

     Add delay to remove authenticator. Problem solved
     I love how there's a delay to remove bank pins but no delay to remove authenticator...     Except it's like a 1/300 drop rate

Idiots like these should stop crying on reddit for attention. Then proceed to show zero proof there router actually gave out, then blame it on some clan.     That's what I said? Was most likely a server dc   not a direct ddos on him. Saw someone point out he was using the world hopper in the video right after the ddos which doesn't load at all on any clients if your Internet is out. Anyways I'm well aware what a DoS,DDos,  Botnet are. If you don't believe me msg me your ip Lul      Lol some of the mods on the subrebbit will remove anything controversial just because they dont like it, its ridiculous, Majority are nice   do their job, but theres a couple mods here who rwt/ involve themselves with fishy characters.     Forgot about amulet of the damned buff for each barrows items.  Only 5 Balance changes since 2015???  Weapon balancing that we currently need -

Dragon longsword - Damage buff

Ballista - Damage Nerf

Armadyl crossbows (special attack) - Damage buff

Dragon mace - Accuracy Buff

Abyssal blugeon (special attack) - Maybe Poisons other players?

We've had about 5 balance changes since 2015 most of them barely affecting the weapon - 

Crystal halberd buff

abyssal dagger buff

blowpipe nerf

Abyssal blugeon buff

Heavy Ballista Nerf - You can 1 tick now   still stack all the damage, It needs a damage nerf.

- I know 07 has a small team, But pvp is dying, noone can deny that.

Maybe if the current meta was changed, More people would start pking more? just a thought, post your thoughts.

Kappa      Wow someone actually did get falsely banned, Wait that happens all the time. However its the people who cry wolf on here that ruins it for the actual people who were falsely banned smh, Its great that they rectify their mistakes quickly though. and i hope the legit sincere people actually are able to get the support they need from jagex.     Yep, Nessy done took my elysian Lmao     You can go on as many accounts as your pc can handle (not against the rules) although breaking multiple rules on many accounts, rwt mass botting etc. Will get your accounts chain banned (They ban all accounts associated with your I.P) but thats rare unless you're a serious rule breaker.  Just got Lured for elysian :(  Got the elysian from 99 slayer + many months of merching.
Anyways i was at the grand exchange when someone came up to me and traded, He put up a 400m cashstack (which he probably got from luring)   said do you want. I'm like sure. He said add me. the scammer then messaged me saying he's tired of playing this game and is leaving for college, so he's giving away all his items but first i need to play a trust game.

He then traded and gave me a ring of dueling, which i accepted   he told me to follow. 

I went over to the duel arena and followed him, when suddenly (scammer #2) comes out of nowhere. He then says, watch out this guy has been scamming people all day, I was lucky enough to anti-lure him though. scammer #2 then goes on explaining how theres 2 rounds, and you take the money and run on the first round. But the more items you bring the bigger the prize will be. So me thinking i can anti-scam i decide to play along and bring my elysian. 

Anyways we arrive at the mage training arena. He then goes onto explain that when you drop items, they appear for everyone in 60 seconds exactly I then agree, He then says to go in the creatures graveyard and try dropping anything going out, then going back in   picking it up. I do it (still playing along) I'm able too obviously. He then says first round of trust game, i want you to drop your ely inside the creatures graveyard, Then come out and trade him for my prize. Still thinking i can pick it up whenever. I go and drop it then quickly come back up and trade him. He then confirms by trading me then he stalls time about 35 seconds in trade. He then says Bury the bones and you win the game, But pick up your elysian first before it goes away. He then puts up 27 bones and an arma helmet in trade   i accept fast. thinking i got a free arma helm i decide to run and pick up my elysian, Still have about 20 seconds. But i cant enter the graveyard, because you cant bring in bones. I then panic and begin dropping my bones as quickly as possible. He enters the graveyard   says thanks. im panic dropping bones as fast as possible. But its too late, he then comes up with the elysian, im pleading with him to give it back, He says he'll give it back on one condition, I say whats the condition, He then says He needs about tree fiddy, Well it was about this time I noticed that this scammer was about 8 stories tall and was a crustacean from the protozoic era. I said, ""Dammit monster, I ain't giving you no tree-fitty! After that i went on my way   started to rebuild from slayer   merching. long story short never trust a scammer.     leader says doesnt seem experienced enough  Can anyone help me find the name of this song?

Authenticator on email doesn't do crap if secondary email doesn't have it aswell, (they hack backup email to get into original email)  Don't know if its been posted here before, But here's a sick for honor downvote gif.       http://i.imgur.com/SFbhQHA.gifv     Some streamers and stuff have been falsely banned though. So i'd imagine if the person wasn't a streamer the amount of crap they would have to do to get a mod to look into it. Like 95% of the time though its some kid trying to be a troll   cause reddit drama.     This has been going on for years. I doubt they'll switch out their potato servers any time soon.      Are you stupid lmao? Look at the video was clearly a server dc, idiot lmfao      Wasn't even ddosed, your entire Internet goes off completely not just runescape.     No because they already have a report option for ""asking for personal information""     Solicitation - the act of asking for or trying to obtain something from someone.     It already is. It's under ""Solicitation"" - the act of asking for or trying to obtain something from someone.     Someone must've obtained your old password somehow most likely through old databases (you should change passwords every 2 weeks) Then they used a method to get through authenticator. If you want I can message you the link to the post on it. (Not going to post it in here cause it will trigger someone/probably get deleted as it is an exploit). Seriously though getting hacked is the worst feeling   I wish you luck on the rebuild.  ",0
subject2991,"    Dung beetles=Garbage men     Mess with the Devil's cob, get your hair pulled out.      Wow! Look at this........GRAPH!!!!     Scales and arpeggios build finger strength and endurance as well as helping your brain to divide the hands from each other making it easier to play different things in different hands. Also if you ever want to learn concertos, there are tons of scales and arpeggios that you are expected to play perfectly.      Name?     You might want to pay more attention to the dynamics. Right off of the start it seemed rather loud. Beethoven was notorious for putting in so many dynamics and expressions throughout his pieces and it is necessary to pay close attention for them.      I think you may have overestimated me, but thank you for the info!     That is clearly a saxophone.....     Togas     When she says, ""I just like you as a friend.""     When she gives you that look!  Masters degree  I'm starting to look at different schools for a masters degree in collaborative piano and I'm not sure what schools to look at. Any ideas?     If a person ever says they are going to beat you up, reply, ""you couldn't even beat your dick!""     Find a bunch of different music and sight and sight read and keep sight reading. You would be surprised how important that becomes later.      Would love to see my teacher sight read something while using this.      Find what inspires you for each piece.     To start I'm just going to say that I don't think that it is the best event they could have come up with, but as someone who lives in the desert, this is something I really like. I have added at least eight more Pokemon to my pokedex, and still need more water types that I don't have. Plus I still need more candies to evolve other Pokemon. It may stink for you, but I would have never gotten enough magikarp candy without walking it and I really don't want to have to walk 600 kilometers to get it. Maybe instead of catching work on leveling up? With increased water Pokemon you could evolve a bunch of different ones for experience.      Try practicing scales by going two octaves up, then switch to contrary motion for two octaves up in the right, down in the left, then two octaves up in the left down in the right, and then back together down to the starting position.      Okay that makes sense, thank you. Scarlatti lived towards the end of the Baroque era so his keyboard sonatas would most likely be played on the harpsichord. In this case there needs to be a sense of baroque style playing, so try to keep it light as far as the touch goes. 

As for interpretation, Baroque music is usually interpreted as very mechanical with little expression, especially Bach, or very romantic (rubato, varying dynamics, etc.). Scarlatti tends to lean towards the more romantic side, so you have tons of freedom to interpret how you would like to.

I would recommend listening to various recordings of different pianists of the sonata you want to learn to get an idea if what other people are doing, so you can formulate your own. 

Hope that helps!     Can you clarify your question? Are you asking difficulty, or stylistic as in how to play?  Unown and other rare Pokemon?  Are the unown in the game yet as well as the other rare Pokemon? I heard about that maybe they are in the game and I saw the numbers in the pokedex, but are they actually in the game? Also if the unown are in the game, is there a chance that when all are caught you will receive some sort of gift?     Both. I'm not sure about getting banned, it is something I would have to research.   Anyone aware of shiny Pokemon?       Use All G.

Highly unusual indeed  College students, what unusual things have you done in order to keep your grades up?    The new officer  One day the police dispatch received a phone call. On the phone was a lady who was screaming that an officer had just broken into their house and searched around. Confused by this the dispatcher tried to calm the lady down, which was unsuccessful, and she eventually hung up the phone. Not sure what to do they disregarded the call as either a prank or someone with a prejudice. 

However, as the weeks continued, they received more and more calls from various homes and companies all saying the same thing. An officer came in and searched the premise without any justification. 

Finally, they managed to ID this officer and sat him down to ask him some questions. First they asked him if he had been breaking into these different places, to which the officer replied, ""Yes.""

Aghast and confused by this they asked him why. The officer looked back and forth at them, then said, ""Well I read it in the training manual. It said I had the ability to search any premise just 'cause.""     That's a good idea. Thanks      It is appreciated   Ginger the baker  
Once upon a time, in a very, very small town, there was a baker who was named Ginger. She was a very modest person, and not only was she humble, but also very soft spoken and kind. She was famous in the town for her baked goods, especially her cakes. 

One day she was experimenting and created a new cookie. So far, everyone loved it. Deciding that she wanted to add the cookie to her common sale items, she needed to name it. So she called the town together and had everyone try it.

Once everyone had sampled the delicious cookies and helped themselves to some complimentary  cake, Ginger walked up onto the stage and said, ""I have asked you all to come here today to help me name this cookie. Any ideas?""

Someone called out, ""What's in them?"" 

She replied, ""There is just the usual stuff, flour sugar and the likes and also some ginger, which is what gives it that special flavor!""

""So,"" the person continued, ""there's ginger in it, and your name is Ginger, so we should recognize you on your creation and call them Ginger Cookies!""

Ginger was appalled by this notion and tried to fight against this idea saying, ""I don't want my name anywhere in the title of the cookies!"" 

However, the people were entrenched with this name and after a bit more of Ginger fighting against it, the crowd began to chant, ""Ginger Cookies! Ginger Cookies! Ginger Cookies!""

Finally, enough was enough and, Ginger began to scream at the crowd angrily, while flipping tables everywhere!

The next morning, the headlines in the local paper read, ""Ginger Snaps!""  How do you find the spark in a relationship again?       But there is snake in someone's boot     You may have just started a war     How long have you waited for this moment?     But the dino might not.     Took me a second, but still Gross  Fred and Dory  Two archeologists named Fred and Dory were down on the jungles of South America searching for ruins. Along with them they had eight laborers to help them with all of there equipment. 

One night the laborers were all around a campfire telling the legends of the jungles. One of these legends was the cannibals that would cut your feet off and save them to eat later as snacks. Later that night one of the laborers disappeared. 

As the the nights rolled on the laborers continued to disappear one by one. 

When there were only two laborers left Fred and Dory decided they needed to flee for their lives, but on their way back they stumbled onto a village. 

The village seemed normal enough. The natives were just going about there business. Fred and Dory were approached by one why gruffly said, ""what name?""

In reply both Fred and Dory told them their names, as did the two remaining laborers. Then without hesitation the native struck down both of the laborers killing them instantly. Fred and Dory backed away with fear in their eyes, but they were soon surrounded and locked in cages. 

They both watched horrified as the natives cut off both of the laborers feet and then hung them to drain the blood out of their bodies. Then it was their turn. Fred and Dory were both killed and had their feet cut off. 

Later in the week, the natives were holding a celebratory feast, and each had their own pair of feet for a snack. One cannibal looks at another and says, ""what you eat?"" 

The other cannibal looks at him and says, ""Dory toes.""      But did we get all the letters right?  What is a life-hack that you use commonly?       People who have pet squirrels??

     Mother's Day.......how ironic     This was a piano piece before it was a guitar piece, just so you know   What movie title sounds better when said sarcastically?    A blonde takes her car to the repair shop  One day after a huge hailstorm, a blonde took her car into the repair shop to fix all of the dents that the hailstorm had created. Upon arrival, the auto-repair men saw the extensive damage and did not want to repair the car regardless of the amount of money they would get. Seeing that she was blonde, the auto-repair men decided to have a little fun. 

They told her, ""Oh you don't need us! All you need to do is take the car home, park it, and start blowing into the tail pipe and all those dents will pop right back to normal!""
The blonde was thrilled by this and hurried home. 

A little while later, the blonde's neighbor, who was also blonde, saw what was happening and came over. ""What are you doing?"" She asked. 

The blonde replied, ""I'm trying to get the debts out by blowing into the tailpipe. But I keep blowing and blowing and nothing is happening!"" 

Her neighbor looked at her and back at the car and exclaimed, ""Oh you silly! You got to roll up the windows first!""

A blonde, a brunette and a redhead go hunting  A blonde, a brunette and a redhead all went out camping and hunting together. After setting up camp the brunette left to go hunt. 24 hours later the brunette came back with a deer. The others were in awe of the brunette and asked, ""How did you do it?""

The brunette replied, ""Found tracks, followed tracks, shot the deer.""

The next day the redhead went out and returned 48 hours later with a bear. The blonde and brunette were in complete awe and asked, ""How did you do it?""

After taking her to the hospital the doctor informed them that the damage was severe and the would have to do surgery to remove different parts of the vagina that were too damaged. 

The surgery went well, but unfortunately the nurses mixed her pain medication with another drug which caused the girl to have vivid hallucinations. She ran out of the hospital and into the street in nothing but her underwear. After running around for a while still racked by hallucinations, she took shelter in a restaurant, but was unfortunately kicked out.

subject2997,"    Roughly 50% more expensive (in the hypothetical scenario where ad revenue is simply replaced by an increase in subscription fees and nothing else changed).      But Barry didn't grow up like Iris was his actual sister. He knew he long before he moved in with her family and already had a crush on her at that point.     Finally? People complain about this all the time.     Yeah I'm pretty sure the only reason the Barry/Patty relationship had less melodramatic CW bullshit is because it was only ever intended to a short thing. If they made her a long-term love interest it would be just as bad as Barry/Iris.      They are only related by paperwork

They're not even related by paperwork, Barry wasn't adopted by the Wests.     Why do you assume Guggie is responsible for this?       besides his TT win last year

And his stage win at the TdS. But yeah      That is teenager stuff. Kara is in her mid 20s.

Unfortunately this is the CW, where adults behaving like teenagers is standard practice.      made 120 an episode on 100 and 200 next season per cast contracts.

Yeah I don't believe that for a second.     The big crossover is just one episode a year, that won't save Arrow if its performance gets too bad.     Seems legit     And then there's [this guy](http://sourcefed.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/maxresdefault-1.jpg)      The ratings weren't that bad

They weren't that good either.     Prison Break finished filming in early July, it didn't really affect the availability of Miller or Purcell for the CW sows.     Na just the CW ones     [Legion's ratings are fine.](http://tvseriesfinale.com/tv-show/fx-tv-show-ratings-33426/)     Local news is typically available over the air.     In the comics books the main villains aren't exclusively speedsters.     Doesn't mean we have to like it      But was this the one with Nina Dobrev?

It was, though she left the show two years ago (but is returning for the series finale).     Switching Sara with John Jr is the biggest effect we've seen (and will likely ever see, since pretty much the entire point of that was to show that Flashpoint had an effect on other shows), and that still wasn't that big.      And how many of those: (a) had the option for extra episodes to be ordered mid-season, and (b) premiered in the fall? Extremely few (most of those 10-13 episode shows are cable shows; cable typically does shorter seasons than broadcast and without the option for midseason extensions). And any shows that don't meet both those criteria, particularly (a), are not relevant to my previous statement.       I've learned from Olicty to never accept the logical and if these people are worse well that applies. 

That is a fair point       Getting the order for the back nine seemed like a surprise.

It wasn't. When a show premiering in the fall has the option for additional episodes to be ordered the producers are hoping that option will be exercised (not getting extra episodes in that situation means the show is pretty much guaranteed to be cancelled), and in Lucifer's case its fall ratings were solid so the back order was not surprising. And many of the show's contracts will account the option for the extra episode order, for instance Lucifer's main cast members wouldn't have been allowed to book other gigs for the time when episodes 14-22 would be filming (unless the producers okayed it).      Well if they are just coming into the show they've got a while to go before she does die.

Only if they're starting from the beginning and not just jumping in now. And even they they do take the 80 hours to watch from from the beginning, if they're doing it specifically for the ships then they've probably had enough spoilers to know that she dies.     Seems a bit late for that..     And then its ratings fell to half those of The Flash. Even if it had a higher budget to begin with I doubt it stayed that way.     Because every season of The Flash follows the same formula      He doesn't know where she is.

But he could easily learn. He seems to know quite a bit about everyone on Team Flash so it's not unreasonable that he'd sniff out an attempt to hide Iris, plus he could also just torture one (or more) of them until they reveal Iris's location. 

Anyways hiding her on a different Earth is effectively no different from just sending her to a different city.     IMO Arrow also suffered a lot in S3-4 from removing the ""normal person"" parts of Oliver's life (Queen Consolidated, Verdant, etc), so Supergirl following that route is not at all encouraging to me.     If Barry send Iris to Earth-3 or Earth-19 what's stopping Savitar from just going there and getting her?     What good would that do?      Many assume this is the last season.

Any who asuumes that hasn't been paying attention; both HBO and the showrunners have stated that season 8 is planned to be the final season.      sure, he's in flashbacks

This is not a minor thing; Slade's late arrival as the present-day Big Bad in season 2 only worked as well as it did because we had seen him so much in the flashbacks.     Did I ever claim that broadcast viewership isn't decreasing? No. Decreasing linear viewership does not mean the industry is dying; you want to claim that the industry is dying then cite a source that actually says that.

  you wanna tell me that tv-less homes are somehow watching broadcast? 

Well...

 all the major broadcast networks let you stream their shows from their websites and apps

Now what the numbers are for that I don't know, but it's entirely possible. Also TV tuners are a thing, though I don't think they're very common.     He did pretty much the same thing on the second mountaintop finish of the that race as well IIRC.      Wonder how it'll affect The Flash or Arrow

I'm going to go with ""not at all"".     Likelihood of events from other shows having significant effects on Arrow: nil.     If?     Watch Arrow 4x08 ""Legends of Yesterday"" for the conclusion of that story.     Barry's kind of an idiot     At this point people are probably downvoting you simply because you're whining about downvotes.     That also doesn't look like a particularly long or steep hill.     Wiggins became a GC contender two years before Froome did and on a different team.      they'd have a bigger budget

Why would the budget increase? The shows earn revenue primarily on a per-episode basis.     But played by an English actor      Their narrative is ""We're the best team in the world on the cutting edge of physical and technological advancements in the world of sport and medicine but some of our guys who went to Med School can't work Excel forms or figure out DropBox""

From my experience I would have no problem believing this by itself. People who are brilliant in their field can often be surprising clueless in others, and many companies have woefully inadequate IT practices (and while Team Sky may be high-budget in the world of cycling, their ~$30 million in annual revenue is really not that large as far as companies go).      at least 2 had full seasons from the beginning.

None of the shows I listed had full seasons from the beginning. It's true that only 3 of the shows on that list had 9 additional episodes ordered, but that list was just from this year; do you want a list of all the shows that had 13+9 orders in recent? Because I can get that, and I can guarantee that of that list Lucifer is the only show which delayed airing its 13th episode until anytime later than March. So should I believe that Lucifer takes significantly longer to produce than basically all other broadcast dramas? Or that the delay is for a different reason?

 Gotham are delaying while having a full schedule.

And it's the same break as Lucifer (maybe plus or minus a week). Again: What's more likely: (a) Lucifer and Gotham both happen go on break at the same time for completely unrelated reasons, or (b) Lucifer and Gotham both go on break at the same time for the same reason. 

 None of your examples are of picking up that many episodes, nor are any of them the quality of Lucifer. 

Three of them (Bull, MacGyver, Designated Survivor) were also 9-episode additional orders, and again there are numerous examples of shows getting back nines if you look beyond just this year. As for 'quality', nothing about Lucifer indicates that it would take abnormally long to produce compared to other network dramas.

 Some from Lucifer did say they didn't have all the episodes done.

They obviously don't have all the episodes done yet, most full-season shows are still filming currently. But has anyone from the show said that the reason for the abnormally long delay was because of production issues? To my knowledge the answer to that is 'no'. 

The only evidence that the abnormally long delay is due to the show's production being behind is random people on reddit have said it, without giving any further explaination or evidence to support the theory (and most were likely just repeating what they saw another redditor say). That is not a good reason to believe it. You ask how I could know this isn't the reason, but you don't ask how one could possibly know that it *is* the reason.     Not officially, but it will be.     They're probably referring to Picard.     Her identity has never been a secret to the DEO. They knew who she was shortly after she first arrived on Earth, and in the very first episode J'onn openly refers to her identity.      Its a paid subscription service.

That doesn't make it legal; similar services have been shut down in the past. Of course they're not not going to *say* that it's not legal because that would be moronic.

 ""Our free plan includes all major terrestrial stations that as an American citizen or resident you would normally be able to receive for free""

The issue is that those terrestrial stations have the rights to broadcast to people physically in the US, not the rights to broadcast to US citizens wherever in the world they happen to be. To legally broadcast or stream in other countries they would need to have purchased the rights to do so in each country, regardless of whether the viewers are American citizens/residents (which ustvnow doesn't actually verify).

Using ustvnow's paid service in the US is [presumably] legal, but that's about it.     It's not legal; TV distribution rights are sold by territory, not by the nationality of the individual viewer. Perhaps for people who are actually located on US territory overseas it would be legal, but even then only their paid service would be legal (unless ustvnow is paying retransmission fees for its free service and just taking that as a loss, but that seems unlikely).     Yep     Wanting alternate ways to access content is not necessarily unreasonable; stealing it when you're not satisfied with the options available to you is another matter.     Most shows that will be starting next fall are currently casting and/or just starting production.      To be clear, they *have* given you a way of giving them money, you just don't like it and want a different way. Which is not necessarily unreasonable, but is still a different situation.      Its free and legal

It's almost certainly not legal, it just hasn't been shut down yet.     Maybe, though it's hard for any of us to say how much. We don't know how the deal with Netflix is priced, or how that compares to the international distribution deals that other CW shows have.      See this link

 Broadcast is dying

Nothing in that link shows that *broadcast* is dying, it's all about cable. And I already acknowledged that cable is not doing well (aside from premium cable).

 Because Nielson is still the gold standard of viewership measurement and very little has been done to take other considerations.

Nielson is still the standard for pricing the sales of commercials on the linear broadcast. That says little about whether or not networks are considering other areas.

Networks are very aware of streaming; all the major broadcast networks let you stream their shows from their websites and apps, and they often advertise those streaming options. Those views are not counted in Nielsen's C3 and C7 ratings because they typically have a different commercial load than the linear broadcast, but the network still counts and considers them. However they don't release those numbers to the public (just like Netflix doesn't release its numbers, and how most of Nielsen's data is not released to the public), so they're not heavily discussed in the media. Also 3 of the 4 big broadcast networks collectively own 90% of Hulu, and the 4th has its own paid streaming service.

However, when a deadly new criminal, Tobias Church (guest star Chad L. Coleman), enters the picture, Oliver realizes the best thing for the city might be a new team of superheroes. Meanwhile, the flashbacks take us to Russia where Oliver faces off against the Bratva.

In particular, as 'Supergirl' is leaving Cat says ""Kara"", then immediately afterwards turns to Kara and says ""And Kyra..."" So Cat knew the proper pronunciation of Kara's name, yet only used it when seemingly directed at Supergirl. The only way that makes sense is if she knew, and her then talking about how they don't look anything alike was a red herring to make Kara think she didn't know.

Also Cat's behavior towards Kara and Supergirl since then fits with her knowing that Kara is Supergirl. For instance in 1.16, Cat didn't seem to be concerned that Kara was missing at the exact time Supergirl that had gone off the rails, and the interaction between Cat and Supergirl  at the end of that episode was far more similar to the interactions Cat had had with Kara that those we'd seen her have with Supergirl.

Edit: Ok certain details of this may not be quite right (see the comments), but I still stand behind the main idea; Cat knows, she's just keeping quiet about it.  [Spoilers] Supergirl 1x16 Promo ""Falling""    Mr. Diggle Wiggle    We had it wrong  The mods were never the real problem, it was the admins all along.      Whatever the local affiliate station wants (usually local news).       But perhaps they will move Arrow to Tuesday at 10 PM for Crossover week

They can't do that, the CW only has the 8pm to 10pm airspace.     Live+3 ratings don't really matter. The CW sells most of its commercials on C3 and C7 ratings, so Arrow is certainly being evaluated based on those, as well as other metrics pertaining to revenue. 

Also if you rank the CW shows by L+SD ratings and them rank them by L+3 ratings the order is pretty much the same.      It seemed more like a specifically tailored response to alarm by someone whose job it is to sell the show.

Exactly. It's just like how last year the AoS producers were spinning the move to 10pm as a good thing even though it clearly was not.     It's because the CW shows *are* cheap.     18-49 demographic ratings. C3 and C7 ratings are the most relevant but also rarely released to the public, so Live + Same Day is the next best.     So Live+7 total viewers, restricted to ABC comedies. Not a metric that matters to broadcast networks.      It was rated number 2

By what metric?      Riverdale has a better chance of standing up to shows like This is Us and the Shonda Rhimes block. 

Can't agree there. TGIT and TIU have a much different viewership demographic than Arrow, whereas Riverdale's is a lot more similar; also as a second-year show that's not pulling huge numbers Riverdale needs more protection than a sixth-year show.     This is on the CW. The pilot was originally being developed for Fox but they passed on it and the CW picked it up.       now they are gonna compete with Arrow

Gotham airs at 8, Arrow at 9; they're not in direct competition.

  DC should try their properties to not clash with each other. 

DC doesn't control that     After Flash, assuming LoT has another 16-17 episode season.     Only a few CW shows made it longer than 6-7 seasons; being on the CW is no guarantee of running forever.      This has already aired correct?

Nope.

 What channel is this mainly on

It'll be on NBC, you can stream it from their site/app after it's aired (or get an antenna and watch it live).
     I don't know if the episode count has been officially announced, but the filming schedule for Riverdale S2 is reported to run from late June to early April indicating a ~22 episode season.      Arrow had the second highest crossover ratings of the 4 shows last year.

And the highest was Flash, not the finale on LoT.      big budget Hollywood won't even show two men kissing

And does the CW? In the DC shows they've shown plenty of kisses between two women but none between two men as far as I've seen.  Trailers for The CW's New Shows: 'Black Lightning', 'Dynasty', 'Valor', Life Sentence'    Trailers For New CW Shows Including 'Black Lightning'       Today at their upfront presentation. The CW president said ""Black Lightning at this point is not part of the Arrowverse"".     TGIT and TIU both have very different viewership demographics than Arrow, I doubt they'll hurt Arrow's ratings all that much. Thurday Night Football is probably a bigger concern, although LoT held up well against it last fall.     Supernatural's ratings this season were only slightly lower than A",0
subject3039,"    Paul Blart Mall Cop.  (Serious) Update/Advice  Hello, a month ago on the r/BPDSOFFA I wrote a little bit about my relationship with my BPD SO. (Can be found here: http://www.reddit.com/r/BPDSOFFA/comments/2ztwh9/my_very_first_relationship_learning_to_deal_and/ ) I recommend that for anyone who wants to know what is sort of going on. This is sort of the update on how things have been. I moved away and she went to rehab for help, she kept me updated and said she is learning more and more about BPD more than she has before which is awesome. We hit the 1 year mark a few days ago (my first relationship!) and at this stage in my life with how things are/have been with the move and her I feel content right now. She still has a few more things to do up where she is at and so that brings me to this. For those of you have lived with a BPD SO what are some advice you could give me? Her and I have lived together but with  her moving to a new state, this will be a new adventure for her. I've read around on here and different places about the risks and believe me you, I feel like I know some of them. Inside I feel this is right, not just for me but also for her and she has told me she wants this too. She wants a new life, a new start, she wants to be happy. Again, I know the risks, at least I feel like I do..I also feel like everything I've/we have been through has helped me to be ready for what is to come. The question I would love to know would be what is the best advice you could give me and what are some things her and I should do/ know before she makes the jump? I feel so much for her, we love each other and as she told me today, what we have is so strong. Who knows, maybe one day I might pop the question to her and ask her to be my wife? I'm 23 by the way and I know that is young..Not saying I'll ask her anytime soon but, hopefully at some point :) 

Anyway, if anyone would give me proper advice that would be tremendous, advice on what to do, what not to do for both her and I. She has expressed interest in going to therapy when she gets out here so that's a plus. I will defiantly have to keep you guys updated on the things to come, thank you     swwwreeeeeeeyt  First post on reddit! 3     What was the relationship between Germany and Japan like in WW2?  Sorry if this has been asked before but I am curious because it's not something I've really heard about before. I would assume they had some sort of trade deal going on but did they work together on the battlefield? Did one side send troops to the other fighting side by side and what was the end goal if the war worked in their favor?      Or! Two lovers being torn apart  This is soap. When I look at it I see something that would be in the cosmos    I always feel like somebody's watching me       Husky :)  I made a new friend today       Friend who bought ""because someone bought six (6) Chalupas and four (4) triple boxes""   My friend spent a total of $40.00 at Taco Bell tonight    Sunset from a friends backyard    Ever have sex while camping?  It's in tents    Why has it taken so long to get or almost get a true look at Pluto?  July 14, after about 9 years and 3 billion miles New Horizons will finally arrive at Pluto and we will finally be able to truly see what it looks like. It may be a simple answer but why did it take so long even with all the high advanced telescopes we have. Being able to get a high resolution of Andromeda you would think it would be easy to get Pluto right?      It's for everything. Tried Netflix and that also did not work. After many tries I switched over to Firefox   People of Reddit! which Sci-Fi spacecraft(s) would you want to be built and why?  Mine would either be Battlestar Galatica/Pegasuses or SSV Normandy SR-2  Network Failed, Can't Install new extensions  Tried reinstalling Adblock plus and regular adblock to no avail today and when I try it gives me a ""Network failed"" pop up with some hints as to help try and fix it. Tried reinstalling chrome twice and also tried with Netflix and that didn't work either. Anyone know of any fix? I also tried downloading off the adblock website which didn't work either    Went camping up at Horsethief Reservoir, Idaho yesterday       ""Adapt and overcome""

subject3065,"    You had me at eating rations out of Agnes     I might do this when I get home.  You don't work at a grocery store do you?     DUKE NUKEM!  He is the original zombie killer so he should know his shit by now.     Ask yourself this question:  Do you want to suck an old dirty cock while taking it in the ass or would you prefer to suck a nice clean cock with good side benefits?      It depends what you want out of life for yourself and your future family.  Did your parents go to college?  If so, then they might be disappointed that you didn't go.  I didn't go to college, my father got an associates in auto mechanics but he didn't have any expectations for me because he was busy drinking.  So anyway I joined the military and it was the best thing I could have done.  The last thing I wanted to do was 4 more years of school and I had to get away from my loser friends.  I joined the Air Force and became a mechanic and recently retired.     My 10 yo daughter likes playing Minecraft and she made a killing zoo with all the different animals in the game.     I think OP is an alien taking a poll on how we would react if they were to drop by.  If you do decide to drop by, please bring gifts.  We are a couple centuries past shiny beads so a teleporting device would be cool, otherwise we may not believe you.     My wife is from a small podunk town in Texas that had two brothers strike it rich with the whole fracking thing (I think they invented it).  Anyway they are billionaires and decided to build an airport to fly in 747's so it's a long runway.  They ended up making the runway longer than necessary so their kids could max out their cars top speed.  They also built a recording studio in town and I've never seen anyone there.     ""Don't look a gift horse in the mouth""  If someone gives you a free horse, don't examine the condition of its teeth in front of the person who is giving it to you.  Not sure what the intended meaning is unless someone is literally gifting you a horse.     Maybe you don't go hiking enough?  With hiking shoes you get way better traction and ankle support than with biking shoes or regular running shoes.  Also hiking a good line is similar to hiking a good line but you have to see where each footstep is going to land.  After a while it becomes instinctive like riding a good downhill route.  I can run across stuff that I would never be able to ride across.     I've been riding MTB's for 19 years (if that matters).  I ride very similar rocky trails and my front tire is a CST BFT, this tire is awesome!  Every time I go out I am impressed with the way this thing sticks.  I just aim for where I want to go and it does it.  On the rear I run an old school WTB velociraptor, traction like none other while climbing on rocks.  Other tires spin out but the big paddle like lugs down the center just keep biting in.     Now you will smell the milk before you drink it...for the rest of your life!     Of course since I was in the Air Force my deployment was considered the Army or Marines vacation.  Those guys had it way WAY harder than I will ever know.  I did 20 years and never once was shot at or was in any danger.  Much respect for those guys.     drowning, I hate water over my head     All of the extensive training for chemical warfare thank god.  We had entire exercises that would last for a week where we had to play like we were being attacked with nerve agent.  Although I was deployed to an island in the Indian Ocean.     ANAL CARNAGE  cuz ur gonna get fucked m8     ANAL CARNAGE  cuz ur gonna get fucked m8     Old ladies and gay guys hit on me all the time, my wife thinks it's funny.     Good news!  They have classes in college for that.  I took one and now I don't have any problem speaking in front of a large group.  They made a video of my first speech and made me watch it, very eye opening.       He was tweaking according to the military channel.     I can speed read.  The first and last sentences in a paragraph are the most important, the shit in between is mostly filler to support the intro and conclusion.  Also the first and last paragraph on each page is the most important, again the rest is filler.  Don't try to vocalize each word in your mind, your brain can process that shit way faster than you can speak it.  Look for numbers and proper nouns, those might be important.     There is nothing to say, I like my life the way it is.     No that's not the same place, the one you found is up by Amarillo, the one I was talking about was near St. Jo.  http://trails.mtbr.com/cat/united-states-trails/texas-trails/texas-dallas/trail/the-breaks-at-bar-h-mountain-bike-ranch/prd_170485_4581crx.aspx

It's probably still closed which is a shame because it was a cool place.  Are the bar H ranch MTB trails in St Jo still closed?  Did some riding there years ago and want to go back.     Yea that shit was funny at first and then I slowly became one of the assholes.       Even if you think you are a fat cow, dress nice.  I've seen some really sexy big girls and they were all dressed nice.  That means no sweat pants.     Ear plugs for sure!  I never realized how much the noise effected me until I used them once.     They look like lumber jacks to me.  My guess is retro truck driver look is next with the plaid sleeveless shirt and sweet trucker hat...but you never know     Assless chaps     Me and my friends were partying out at the cliff overlooking Lake Michigan.  There was a house down the shore where they were constructing a building so they had some heavy equipment and other stuff around the place.  We decided to do a covert raid on the place in the middle of the night to see what we could snatch.  I found a box of nails and stuck them in the dirt facing up all the way across their driveway.  Then I got in the backhoe and proceeded to piss all over the interior of it.  About this time I hear a loud crashing sound (friend tried to smash out the large front window of the house) and a bulldozer starting up (other friend was gonna try and drive it off the cliff).  I freak out and run back to my jeep and they all show up shortly after.  We all jump in my jeep and haul ass out of there.  By pure coincidence we get back to the main road and a cop car goes flying by right in front of us so we chuck the vodka bottle out the back and I proceed to get the fuck out of there.  So the cop doesn't even come after us but I'm still driving all over the damn countryside like I'm being chased because it was fun.  Anyway there was a sweet jump coming up at the bottom of the hill over some train tracks so I decide to hit it full speed.  I forgot the road splits off in a Y right on the other side so when we landed we were going too fast to make the corner so I stuffed it in this guys front yard.  I bash my face on the steering wheel and only see dirt flying.  My buddy in the back seat rams his face in the back of my seat and bloodied his nose really good.  Next day come to find out that backhoe and dozer belong to my bosses husbands company and she is asking us if we knew anything about it (we all worked at the grocery store together).  I've been through this drill before and I pretended like I knew nothing.  There are a lot more stupid shit stories we used to do but that one sticks out.  A couple random things...slashing tires for no reason, shooting out windows with bb guns, turfing rich people's lawns with my jeep (ideal yard was on a corner), stealing shit from the store....once we put all the fighting fish together in the pet section, they fucked each other up.  Drove out onto a baseball field with the intention of tearing that shit up, instinctively I looked around first and a fucking cop was watching us.  Slowly drove out of there and of course got pulled over and my buddy was freaking out cause he had an oz of weed on him and a big ass knife...I talked my way out of it.  Broke my brothers back in my jeep.  Almost burned up my girlfriend in my jeep (accidentally).  I never got caught but some of my friends did...one is still in prison 20 years later cause he helped kill someone.  I got the fuck out of there and joined the military, best decision I ever made.     They have KFC in Germany, it's not bad     Vagina     Keep your dog on a leash!  Next time I see him out im gonna fingerbang his ass!     From nose picking.     If it's an alien, it should know better than to break into my house and try to anal probe me.  Therefore I would view it as an immediate threat and choke it out with its own puny alien stick arms.  Then I would lock it in my gun safe after getting the ole mossberg 500 out then go looking for more.      Was drunk and jumped on my buddies motorcycle without a helmet for a quick night ride.  Came around a corner and 3 deer were standing right in front of me.  I didn't have time to stop so I aimed for the gap between them and made that shit!  Needless to say I turned my ass around and slowly went back to the house.     I had this crazy bitch that worked for me and she used this one on me...I wrote her ass up lol!  I really wanted her gone but she knew how to ride the fine line and I was not experienced enough to end her.  If she tried that shit now...BAM fuck her right in the pussy!     Texas     I'm also ambidextrous...was taking a dump when I saw your comment so I had to try.  It was a little awkward but I got it done with no mess lol     I can write backwards with my non dominant hand...in cursive!     Where do you see yourself in 5 years?     I had to go look...reminds me of tutting.       Have you ever tried it?  You might like it!     Lol it works good for making grilled sandwiches     So I'm 41 if that is aged enough...pretty much twice as old as you lol.  Anyway, picture yourself being my age.  Think of the worse case scenario health wise (300lbs, diabetes, heart problem, hair falling out, kidney stones, liver transplant lol) and do everything you can to keep that from happening.  If you smoke STOP NOW!  In my opinion these things are entirely avoidable but people do not take care of themselves.  Because in the end, your health is the only thing you really have.       Spray butter is the shit!!     I retired from the military at 39.  I get $2,000 per month for my retirement pay.  If I live to be 81 I will have been paid over $1 million dollars.  Basically I won the lottery!     You make Minecraft videos!  My kids will watch hours of Minecraft videos and then go replicate what they just watched...ALL DAY!     One uppers.  Most of them don't even realize they are doing it.  I like to nonchalantly one up them back, wether it's true or not, they get the hint pretty quick usually.     I'm not the only one lol!  I have to post now...     You don't need a fat bike to ride in the snow...or studded tires.  I lived in Alaska for 4 years and found riding my MTB on snowmobile trails is almost like riding on a sidewalk.  Other things I did were cross country skiing, snow shoeing, ice skating.  It only seems cold outside until you actually get out there, that's the hardest part!     All gave some but some gave all.      Amsterdam!  Hookers n blow woo hoo!     Nothing, I don't even know how it works or what the point is.     Go sign up at the nearest Air Force or Coast Guard recruiter.      You see it all the time with parents at their kids sporting events.  The parent yelling at their kid like its the damn major leagues but even if it were so, it's still a GAME.  I hate those kind of people.     Yes, stop fucking around and trying to rationalize to yourself to drink more alcohol and quit drinking NOW.  Not tomorrow, not next week, RIGHT...FUCKING...NOW!  Get rid of anything you have in your house and try to find something else to do with your time.     Just out of curiosity, how many people have actually PM'd you ""MONEY OR BOOBS""?     I think the people who organized it were trying to get the attention of the average American citizen.  Since WWII we have been manipulating the Middle East in order to get the most oil for the lowest cost and I think these people were trying to bring this to the forefront of the American conscious.  Basically they were tired of us meddling in their affairs.  I really think they were not expecting the response we gave them, however it had a tendency to unite the ""extreme"" Muslims, which by the way we didnt want because we needed the oil at the time.  Fast forward 15 years...now we have fraking so we don't need to rely on the Middle East for oil like we had to in the past.  In the mean time, our military is weakened from a decade of war and China and Russia are taking advantage of the situation by taking over neighboring states and creating islands to project their power while Obama coasts out of the White House.     When buying cars the floor guy will act like he has no control over the price of the car you are trying to buy and has to constantly go to his ""boss"" and ask during negotiations.  Then when you are done with him you have to talk to the finance guy (btw don't ever use their financing) and he try's to load you up with all this extra crap.  You tell him no but he puts it in the paperwork anyway hoping you don't see it and the whole time he acts really busy and annoyed he has to deal with you.  Then they will try to lowball you on your trade in...don't ever trade in your car.  Sure it's convenient but pay for that convenience.  I hate car salesmen/women.     Got up and got my boy ready for school and walked him down to the bust stop, woke up my 2 daughters and hung out with them until they had to go to school.  Went back to bed for like an hour and a half.  Got up and made myself a cappaccino and a PBJ for me and the wife for breakfast.  Rolled out to my garage and changed out the front brakes on wife's car then took car for test drive.  While out I fill it up with gas for her and used our Kroger points to get $.20 off per gallon.  Came home and started a load of laundry then took a shower.  Put the clothes in the dryer and plucked my wife's eyebrows and chin for her (she loves that I do that for her).  Went out to eat lunch at Montana's, not going there again cuz it sucked.  Came home and hung up my laundry and got my lunch ready for work (2nd shift).  Massaged my wife's upper back cuz it was bothering her.  Got to work and sat through weekly safety meeting and listened to Alex make fun of entire presentation.  Changed brushes on 3 traction motors and also the main generator slip ring brushes.  Inspected the main gen fuses and diodes.  Now I'm chilling at work waiting for 11:25 to get here.     Like literally chowed down on some turds?     Lolz were had      Lolz were had     I would drink my own wine piss and see if it comes out stronger.  Same with my chocolate shit.     Take 3 hits of acid and PM me in the morning.       That's awesome!  Once I got a large drink at McDonald's, you know the styrofoam one, and it sat in my truck all day in 100 degree heat and still had ice in it after 8 hours!  I paid $1.05 for mine though     Good luck man, hopefully it will work out for you.     Looks like a fun trail.     You guys have good rocket engines.     Way to go man!  Seems like whenever I take people out riding bad things always happen to them.  I don't even like riding with strangers because I feel bad when they crash because I feel like it was my fault for going too fast.  I guess I'm a bad teacher.     We get 10 seconds in Michigan.       What about would've (sounds like would of)     Ok, I always use the Enduro Max bearings on my bike, check out their website:  http://endurobearings.com/products/bearings/max/    
Find your size in the catalog then Google shop the part number for the best deal.  good luck!     Wait!  Are you sure the suspension bearings are making the noise?  Maybe you have a loose bottom bracket.  Maybe you have a loose or squeaky seat or seat post.       You may be surprised by how much the U.S. still makes.  http://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-manufacturing-dead-output-has-doubled-in-three-decades-2016-03-28     I could easily take that corner, they were just trying to go way too fast lol     But it was still bad right?  I mean the part where they were snatched from their homelands, separated from their families, stacked into cargo holds of ships like cord wood and then forced to endure the entire Atlantic crossing like that?       I don't think this is a documentary, it's more like a Lockheed Martin commercial.     I'm a mountain biker, you can wave at me if you want to.  Also I'm a hiker, if I see a mountain biker bombing down a sweet downhill section I'll gladly move out of your way!  Sometimes I ride my bike on the road, I try to be considerate of traffic behind me and not hog the road with my slow ass.  Sometimes I drive my car down the road, I don't get mad when a slow ass biker is hogging the road, I just wait until I can pass safely.  Don't get me started on horses though...     I lived in Vegas for a while and there is a lot of hiking in the area, I used this website to find new places:  http://www.birdandhike.com/Hike/_Hike_index.htm     The best thing he mentioned was TUCK AND ROLL.  Don't try to break your fall by putting your arms out, that's how people get broken collar bones.     Been MTB'ing for 19 years, I don't worry about my bike until next time I want to ride it unless I know something broke.  It's in my garage right now covered in mud from my last ride, I'll just lube the chain and air up the tires next time I go out because it's just going to get dirty again.     I'm bored at work so I looked around...found a router specific forum that asks your question and many people answered.  http://www.routerforums.com/general-routing/98705-need-some-help-restoring-vintage-craftsman-router-315-25050-a.html#/topics/98705?_k=n4wbkf     Added bonus, no more illegal aliens from Mexico!     Yea, by looking at the size of the gears, the output shaft turns faster than the hand crank.  I looked up Eureka and they made all kinds of stuff so there is no telling what this was used for.     I second WWII, although you need to understand that it was just a continuation of unresolved issues from WWI, which in turn was a culmination of smaller issues all leading to the outbreak of the first ""modern war"".  I was always taught that WWI simply started because Franz Ferdinand was shot, nothing more or nothing less.  This, of course, is not the case so I had to go do some reading to find out for myself.  Additionally, to understand what is going on in the middle east, you need to have an understanding of how the two wars shaped the current countries of the area.       Definately aliens     Yea I bent it back as good as I could but it's not perfect.       Maybe static caused by liquid transfer and not properly grounded?  Glad nobody was hurt.     Maybe your rear derailure or hangar is bent a little.  Mine is tweaked a little and it acts goofy in the middle of the cassette so I just don't use those gears if possible.  I'm too cheap to buy a new one.     That's good you can change out the battery quickly, that way you aren't stuck in one gear out in BFE.  Also are they water proof?  There have been times I've submerged my rear derailure riding across creeks and swamps.    Locomotive traction motor change  Changing a traction motor on a GE C44ACCTE.  Nothing out of the ordinary but thought you guys might like it anyway.  Locomotive engine failure    Changing a locomotive grid blower motor    Engine won't crank    Temperature difference  In my lifetime I have experienced a 183 degree F temperature difference.  -60 (without wind chill) in Fairbanks Alaska and 123 degrees F (without heat index) in Las Vegas Nevada.  My Great, Great Grandfather's Two-Man Saw    Antique air compressor    Be nice to your cashier  I used to work in a grocery store as a bagger a long time ago.  One time this old lady was being really bitchy to the cashier so I dropped cans of soup she had bought on top of her grapes and smashed them.  I was imagining how pissed she would be when she got home.  Ouachita Challenge anyone?  Anyone planning on doing the upcoming Ouachita Challenge in April?  I have started getting back into shape for it, it's been about 10 years since I did it last lol!  I live Granbury so I ride a lot in Glenrose at the dinosaur park.  I plan on doing at least one weekly MTB ride there in the mornings (I work 2nd shift) between 9:30 and whenever.  Let me know if you want to come out and ride!  (I'm not fast)      I'm happy for the kid, at least he has an opportunity to do something if he wants to.  He's already a black belt which is an accomplishment in its own.  Past accomplishments are a good predictor of future performance.     He seems to be well on his way.     I'd make him bark like a chihuahua if I were bubba (kinda like squeal like a pig if you know what I mean wink wink).     Yea they played videos all the time, I would record my favorite ones on the VCR and watch them again later.     Yea I still don't get it.     I saw it on MTV when the video came out.     Sorry man, good luck     According to their chart they should work together, maybe you got a bad shifter.  I am assuming you read the manuals and set it up per instructions vs winging it.  You should probably contact their tech support or customer service.     Not a bike mechanic but I was looking at the SRAM compatibility chart and everything is compatible...What size chainrings are you using?  The chart specifies 44/33/22.     Do it.     Seems the consensus so far is the ""winners"" don't get punished, only the losing side.     Thanks for the reading material!       Thanks for the info!  I didn't even consider when the UCMJ came along.     Have you heard of IMBA? https://www.imba.com  They have a forum area and this is where you will find the answers you are looking for.  I have no personal experience on getting land access, good luck!     Awesome reply, thank you     I've just been seeing people argue about war crimes that were committed in the past when, at the time, they were not really considered crimes.  It's easy for us now, long removed from the situation, to criticize what was normal behavior during times of war.     Ok thanks I'll check them out!     Looks like the Lieber Code allowed reprisal against recently captured POWs by musketry.  Can't do that anymore.  Do you know of any instances where a Union soldier broke the rules of the Lieber Code and were punished or was this more of a guideline?     See what you get from talking to the anus?     That's right, the officers were from the aristocratic class back in the day and they had to maintain political ties back home for the most part I suppose.     Check out Time Z pedals.  They are clip less and have a platform, it's what I run on my xc bike.  I've had them for a long time and they never gave me a problem like my old SPD system.  I started out using toe clips and eventually switched to clipless and never looked back.  I like to be firmly attached to my bike and not bouncing all over the pedals.     Seems like the first step is to secure permission for building trails before you start.     This is why you need to wear a helmet.     Ok, so the trials were conducted at the end of the war.  I'll look into those to see if they knew they were willfully violating any prior agreement.  Thanks!     Ok, I'll do some reading on the Hague Convention.  Thanks for the reply!  History of the concept of War Crimes question  How well established was the concept of today's version of ""war crimes"" during the American Civil War?  I saw some discussion about war crimes on another post during the civil war and I am wondering if they are applying today's concept of war crimes onto the actions of the armies of the time.     You have a rare piece of history, make sure it stays in your family.  I like the picture of the big storks nest on top of the old house!  Thank you for sharing!     Looks like this was the last time the Whitehead torpedo's were used in battle anywhere.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitehead_torpedo     Very interesting, thank you for posting!       Yes, gotta strengthen the core for sure.     I got four!     Yea I remember reading about different suspension designs and how they react to terrain differently.  My bike has the Faux Bar design and when I stand up to power up a steep hill the torque tries to lift the back wheel off the ground which makes it spin out easier vs old hardtail.  Or maybe I'm hallucinating.     $5,000 you say...I'll definitely check more into it.  He's only 8 and he said he doesn't do it that much but watches videos or other kids scripting.     I rode a hard tail for years but now I ride FS.  The main trade off I noticed is the FS lack of climbing ability compared to hardtail.  I had bar ends on my hardtail and I could stand up and pedal, you cannot believe how much traction those things have until you try one.  I miss technical uphill climbs, sorta.     My daughter had made them today while my wife was at work...We ate all of them before she got home.     Are these separate spank sessions?  If so I would recommend cutting the number down a little, maybe 3 max.     I think it's Japanese porno cartoons.       Thank you for your service!

Not sure about the down votes...the man asked a question, I replied with my experience of not performing any maintenance and the longevity of the components with said lack of maintenance.     You mean 50 minutes right?  I usually eat a power gel every 45 minutes to keep me going on rides over an hour.  Anything less than an hour ride for me and I'm fine with only water.  If I go longer than an hour without eating anything I start having mood issues and start having a bad time.     That's what I'm talking about!       My man!     I tried only water on a 35 mile ride, I didn't make it.     My last FS bike I had for 8 years and serviced the rear shock once towards the end before it was stolen, never touched the front shocks.  My current bike I've had since 2011 and so far no service and no problems...If it ain't broke don't fix it.     The amount of war material the US was able to muster was three times that of all the other countries combined!  If the US had remained neutral throughout the war and not provided any materials whatsoever the outcome in Europe would have been much different.  Here are some very interesting stats:  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_production_during_World_War_II     Check out the IMBA epic map...https://www.imba.com/model-trails/epics/all-rides     I said earlier that the guy who raped his 12 year old daughter should literally have a new asshole torn by bubba...With a broken broom stick.  Fuck that guy.     Should've could've would've...Should of could of would of, once I saw should've of     A large angry man wearing camouflage threw a trash can down the bay and woke us all up after getting 3 hours of sleep.  I was wide awake.     Same here, I really don't remember when I learned how to use a clutch.  Maybe I was born with it like you!     Hero with Jet Li.  The sound is awesome on a surround sound system, the story line is great, the action is on point, it was done in Chinese which adds to the whole martial arts theme.     My kid loves playing Roblox.  He would always talk about whatever he was doing on there and for a while I didn't want to hear it.  Then I realized this is something he is passionate about so now I let him tell me all about it and I ask him questions to keep him going.  He likes building things and scripting (still not sure what that's all about).  I watched a part of one of your videos yesterday and that's cool you two make videos together.       I was in a similar situation as you but I HAD to run because I was in the military.  I was in the Air Force for about 10 years and we never had to run but then they came up with fitness standards so I had to start running.  At this point I have been biking quite a bit so I had my cardio base built up like you.  The problem I found was I could go out and hammer out a couple hours on the bike but barely run 1.5 miles.  This was before internet so I was on my own.  I have learned that being good on a bike does NOT transfer over to being a good runner.  Different muscles are used and it takes lots of training to get them strong enough to be worth a crap.  Another problem I developed was plantar fasciitis, which may be what you experienced with the heel spur issue (I'm not a doctor).  That's because I would go out and run long runs without the proper build up to strengthen my ligaments and tendons, basically I was doing too much too fast, apparently you need to build up mileage slowly over time.  So ""becoming a runner"" is going to take a long time and you need to ease into it or you will get injured, unlike biking.     Sick fuck gets what he deserves.  I hope they put him in the same cell with big bubba and he tears him a new asshole, literally...With a broom stick.     I always wanted to live in Salt Lake City.  It looks like they have everything I like to do close by.  Plus they have four seasons unlike Texas.     Bam!  https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/9jt/BICYCLE-DISNEY-GOOFY-HANDLEBAR-MOUNTED-SQUEEZE-HOOTER/B005FVXMT0     A real man isn't swayed by marketing hype.     Maybe I can explain.  When I'm out on the trails I'm out there to have fun and relax.  I want to be alone in the wilderness and not be comparing myself to other people or even myself while railing some sweet single-track.  I have used it trail running a few times though just to track how far I went.  Running is different for me, I'm there to torture myself so I'll be better at MTB'ing.     Something something violent pose...TURN THAT SHIT DOWN!!     Air Force mechanic...A yard of flightline, bolt stretcher, K9P, fallopian tube, prop wash.     Dirt.  I vaguely remember eating dirt as a child.  Once I ate some that had oil in it from my mom's car in the driveway, I think that's when I stopped eating it.     I don't.  My parents were anti sports so I never got into it.  I did ride my dirt bike, 4 wheeler and snow mobiles a lot and I enjoy watching a good motocross race even if I don't know the names of the guys racing.  That is something I can relate to, I know how much skill and conditioning it takes for a person to go that fast on a motorcycle.  I'm guessing it is similar for people who played football or baseball as a kid, they know what it takes to be able to perform at the professional level and probably wanted to do it at some point.     Statistically speaking, you have a better chance of being struck by lightning (1in 960,000) than die in a plane crash (1 in 1 million).  However, you really should be scared every time you get in a car because your chances of dying in a car crash are 1 in 4,433 if you live in Montana.  Your fear is irrational compared to the other every day things that have a higher probability of killing you so relax and live like there's no tomorrow!  (Because you might die choking on your dinner 1 in 4,404)     I'm hoping for at least 85, possibly 90.     A hand crafted turkey sandwich made from HEB's finest brand name wheat bread, stuffed with Kroger's mesquite smoked turkey and a slice of Kroger brand pepper jack cheese topped with a slathering of spicy mustard.  Chased with a 12oz can of Mountain Dew and a few chunks of freshly cut pineapple.  Mmmmmm     I've seen many smart people make stupid decisions and I have also seen stupid people make good decisions.       They have Viagra for that now...Be careful what you wish for     I have had the same problem as you.  You want to recreate the scene and the feelings you had while you were taking the pics.  I have come to realize that it's not really possible and I try to disconnect my feelings and memory of what I saw while taking the pic and focusing more on what I can make it look like afterwards because I rarely get a photo to come out like I ""wanted"" it to.     It's my pics, I do what I want.     I was in the military and was stationed in Alaska and was transfered to Louisiana, I'm from Michigan and we stopped by to visit family.  I didn't want to leave AK but I had to.     Yea we thought about walking around devils",0

No one is forcing anyone to eat their shitty college food...also, anyone who judges an entire culture on cafeteria food is an uncultured idiot anyways but \_()_/     Actually no...he's only 3 years older than her   she was 18 when she was pregnant.

I'm a girl and I sent it to a girl as well     That makes me feel a bit better tbh      Thank you. Yeah we literally broke up days ago  Half a bottle of vodka later...       Live-in-life     I really appreciate the input...to be honest, I hadn't even considered that   don't know much about it. Does BPD share a significant amount of traits with NPD?     Yep my Russian/Latvian family who got separated in the holocaust TOTALLY must have had slaves here in a continent thousands of miles away      Wait so he's a legitimate model!?!     My EXACT thoughts

Like      Definitely true! It's RIDICULOUS how hard it is to fill a prescription that's actually needed, when it's so overly perscribed. I've legitimately had to go to 6 different pharmacies for a single script once     K but no ones arguing that..?     Nope. That's flexing your white priv     Hii you're clearly just bisexual   ashamed to accept it for some reason     I personally love being the one to give BUT I'm very fem   most women I date are on the more androgynous side-therefor it's usually a giant power struggle haha. That being said, there are MANY women who ONLY give   are uncomfortable receiving. This would be a good dynamic for you.     I think a common misconception is that if a proper diagnosis is made, the corresponding prescriptions won't produce negative side effects   that's simply not true...  Someone can definitely have ADD   still experience adverse effects of a stimulant at a low dose. For example, adderall is mostly effective for me-though it does seem to trigger my already pre-existing insomnia/disordered eating. BUT it's much less dangerous for me than Vyvanse for some reason. Everyone's different   our bodies just react differently     This reminds me of how I've been called transphobic for saying I'd never date ANYONE with a penis. Keep in mind I'm lesbian   have in fact dated people who identify as trans. Refusing to take the d makes a lesbian a ""bigot""? How is THAT mindset not considered misogynistic      YES     ...I've never heard of that. 

Personally I went from 120 to 90 lbs in maybe 1-2 years on it      Fine? I'm gay   have lots of tattoos but I MADE THE CHOICE to be these things openly period     What gay people...     What's funny to me is how so many SJWs are SO about being ""sex positive"" and are against ""kink shaming"" but GOD FORBID someone has a preference that excludes them, suddenly the tables turn      No one said it can't ""be a thing."" It just doesn't make you a part of the gay community, which is CORRECT. A real sjw would demand a ""safe space"" within the lgbt community all for wishing to have sex at the right time.     Nah you CAN in fact do whatever you want. You just can't expect to be praised, coddled or even accepted along the way. It's a choice     

Omg that flair      I'm Mel, 25, from Denver but living in Brooklyn now. I moved here to study Fashion Design   am also a full time intern at a design showroom in Manhattan. I'm gay, single, love going out   feel like my life couldn't get much further from the lives of the teen moms but still somehow I've always had mad love for it hahah. I think I just enjoy watching stories so different from mine, stories that make me see there's more to everyone than meets the eye both good   bad ya know?     25, Brooklyn   my roommate actually got me hooked haha. We bond over teen mom   she convinced me to make a Reddit just for this sub. I stand by it haha      Nope I definitely meant misogynistic... The statement is basically saying to prefer just vagina, is wrong   that one must also accept penis. It's basically forcing men on people who are not attracted to men     who the fuck finds out someone uses tampons   thinks ""DAMN THEY COOL!"" ???     #ableist
     How is this mindset not seen as INCREDIBLY misogynistic? Even further, one could say it perpetuates rape culture...to guilt someone into accepting penis despite their comfort or personal preference     I CANT http://imgur.com/iBhPaiE     If you can't write without being an arrogant douche bag, don't.

Aka need to bump into these two messes     No not necessarily...I mean it's sort of setting yourself for disappointment to expect more than a hookup-BUT that doesn't mean that's EVERYONES intention. I dated a girl I met from Tinder for about 5 months     Ahh okay that makes sense. But does that mean his DV charges with Jenelle were dropped?     Ummm what's up with the date? Also doesn't he have other charges? Where did you find this? Something seems off     SAME     Wait how else does one pronounce groceries? Gross er ees?     No I made the choice to be OPEN about it in the work place      Yeah same here     The fact that so many of us have no clue what ""doxxing"" even is, should show how little we give a shit about random tumblr bloggers lol

Edit:spelling     Admittedly it's hilarious someone thinks they can delete an entire sub-Reddit due to made up ""doxxing."" BUT I think considering this person clearly isn't very reasonable   Is a clear instigator, you should just delete this whole post. It's not contributing anything positive.     !!!YES

I kept waiting for her to tear up or AT LEAST tell her how beautiful she looked etc but nope nadda
     ""I'm a left winger but just stop."" I mean, obviously...?     **she'll buy herself another ring     Lincoln's hot mess teacher      Well regardless you get my point. It's not a LIFESTYLE for her ya know?     What a dick!

Edit: but I looked @ her account   she seems to habitually hate on celebrities   teen moms in particular. I wonder if he just snapped eventually   handled it poorly     Oh what Twitter fan? Do tell haha     What does her ""in bed"" have to do with ANYTHING? Bye     This is a joke right...? One of them openly DRANK WHILE PREGNANT. The other doesn't even really drink in general let alone pregnant...how can you not understand the difference?     I doubt she cares enough to ""try   throw people off"" tbh     Jenelle looks really sad in almost all her youngest photos, which makes me sad too     Omg I forgot about that! What season/episode?!      RIGHT!? I'm all for a laugh or two but expecting someone to go hunt down years worth of 30 something year old yearbooks is WAY too much     That's TOO much...this is getting obsessive don't you think?  Showing someone TM for the first time  Since Teen Mom is after all a [guilty] pleasure, I often find myself having to realllly explain when wanting to watch it with someone who hasn't before. Like I've got to find THE trashiest/most drama picked episode to show them as a starting point ya know? Which episode would/have you chosen to show a first timer to get 'em hooked?     Even with consequences, they still continue     You win     The entire series is on YouTube

You're welcome     I think it's supposed to look drawn like a comic ya know? How their features are exaggerated     Lol doubtful....pleather pockets are everywhere. He's not original      You're correct...he said so on the special      This person has been trolling all the trans related posts, just ignore them   exercise your power to downvote      wtf i especially hope that dog one is untrue omg :(     Nathan's EVEN WORSE because as terrible as Adam is, he isn't violent :l     in all fairness, farrah made a comment about kail in the newest article someone just posted. i'm guessing thats what she's referring to     I think what bothers me most about this whole argument, is that it doesn't take into account that there may very well be trauma involved in someone's aversion to certain genitalia. Whether that's rational or not, isn't the point. Someone not disclosing to some who is already a victim of sexual trauma, that they have certain parts may in fact really fuck with them.      So would you expect someone who's infertile to tell you right away?     oh good ol' TERFS      perfect, looking forward to it (:     Im so happy to hear of someone else with the same set of unique circumstances...I know of many who were already with someone who later transitioned or people who met someone after, but none who met before   got together after as well... how does your boyfriend feel about your sexual identity? Mine doesn't seem comfortable with mine   it's mostly something we avoid      It's because your scalp provides the oil that keeps your hair moisturized, so extensions become dry   brittle very easily without washing w/ special shampoo   conditioner     She looks like Jodie arias to me :/     I agree :/ well for now, I'm working on my degree in NY   don't really see myself leaving since I Work in Fashion Design which is limiting. He doesn't want to leave his government job in Denver because of his health coverage plan while in transition :/ it's just tricky for the time being ya know?  Comforting long distance boyfriend  Just a basic overview; I've known my boyfriend about 6 years, though we were merely acquaintances for the majority of that time. At such time, he wasn't out yet   identified as a lesbian, as have I. Fast forward to a few months ago... we started chatting casually on facebook,   seeing that I'm now currently living 2000 miles away/had nothing to lose, I confessed how I've always found him attractive. From there we began texting, calling,   realizing how genuinely compatable we are for one another. He visited me last month,   though I was iffy if I'd still find him attractive because of pheromones etc [he's 9 months on T   undoubtedly a man], I'm truly very much in love   incredibly attracted to him. Being that we are long distance in the midst of his transition, he's expressed the fear that the further he goes on T, the less I will be attracted to him. He's scared I'm just attracted to the version of him from years ago, that best aligns with my previous homosexual identity. I assure him that what attracted me then was his smile, dimples   puppy dog eyes. Those are still a part of him. Not only that, but I find myself attracted to the things I thought I'd be turned off by; I.e. His tummy hair, deep voice etc because I know these are all things that make him feel better aligned with his authentic most self   his confidence alone is sexy. It just gets hard some days reminding him of all this, especially when dysphoria hits :/ anyone else in a similar situation or able to offer some advice in aiding him to feel more secure in my love for him?     I personally feel Amber is well aware of all these tweets, KNOWS they were him, knew he was a Teen Mom creep from the beginning   LIKED that about him... she knew how desperate he is   is just as desperate to be idolized. Its sick   I feel no sympathy     She's a fashion design student now @ FIDM in California   laying low I believe

PLEASE EXPLAIN THE PORN INCIDENT!?     I deleted it. I get you didnt mean anything by it. but still its shitty to refer to her as ""Bruce"" still     okay hopefully

  if so, my bad     i never said she was nice     i'm referring to her treatment of the other girls within the franchise     i mean degrading to the other girls of the franchise     I mean they're all trash...some just less so than others

Ugh how fake can he be!? His tweet of praise is STILL up      Spoiler :/     I was with you all the way until the last sentence :l     I like how she thinks morality   legality are the same thing #SoDeep     I think she thinks ""mentality"" means mental state      He refuses counseling... :/

He's told me he's feeling really dysphoric,   that the lack of sex is making it worse (?)

but I can't get myself to give him only that aspect of things...I feel zero sexual attraction to anyone ever without the emotional aspect being tended to first   foremost ya know? :/  Ftm boyfriend   emotional changes?  My boyfriend   I have been together since September, though I've known him for years. We met as ""lesbians"", though he's been on T over a year now   I fully recognize/respect his male identity. We were long distance until a few weeks ago, when I moved in with him. Before that, the last time we saw one another was mid January. i was generally the more dominant one, making the moves. He liked being held, cried sometimes   was openly sensitive. Within that last month apart, there have been a ton of biological changes. His voice is much deeper suddenly, he's growing a mustache   in general, he's passing SO much more. Now he pulls away from most affection...he has a suddenly new dislike for cuddling, holding hands etc. Even if I simply rest my head on his shoulder, he complains that I'm treating him as though we're in a ""lesbian relationship."" Even touching his thigh or offering him back massages [which he used to beg for] now seems to offend him. He told me straight up, I need to learn how to appeal to a MAN physically   that touching him where I do turns him off now... His lack of affection has made me scared to initiate sex   that lack of initiation on my part, has in turn angered him. we even broke up because of it.... but we still live together   are trying to mend things. I just feel at a loss for how to move forward from here. How can I validate him while still not catering too heavily to toxic gender roles? Anyone else ever gothrough this emotional hault of sorts...?     I disagree...idk enough about circumcison to say whether I agree or disagree w/ it BUT I do know most people at least BELIEVE it to be medically beneficial-not just cosmetic.   that is where it greatly differs from other body modifications IMO     Kail reaches out to the press   stirs shit up on Twitter. Chelsea genuinely keeps to herself...  cis gf seeking advice for ftm bf  So I will probably post this on r/mypartneristrans but it's not nearly as active as this subreddit   also tends to be more mtf oriented. I'd love to hear from you guys on the following;
My boyfriend has been on T for about a year now,   isn't often misgendered anymore. But saturday was real rough... [first off, most of his family still calls him by his dead name   misgenders him pretty routinely]. We went to a family get together so the day already was probably not exactly easy for him. He's too shy   sweet to correct anyone   I don't really feel comfortable correcting his family since they're just now meeting me [i just moved in with him last week from across the country]. Anyways, the real discomfort came later into the night. we agreed to see his cousin perform at an open mic night/stand up comedy. We arrived a few minutes late   had to sit in the very first row. One of the comedians blatantly made eye contact with my boyfriend   loudly butchered his pronouns. Immediately, my bf left the room   headed to the bar for beer. I followed after   he said he was fine, but ""too sober"" for such an experience. I understood   we headed back in, enjoying the rest of the night. That is until he was ONCE AGAIN called ""she"" by ANOTHER comedian. My heart fucking broke for him   again he headed to the bar. This time when I asked if he was okay, he ""jokingly"" said he'll probably avoid being in public for a long while   will be pretty emotionally fucked up. He continued just drinking the night away   not really wanting to acknowledge the pain of it all. We haven't really talked about it since   I just know he's hurting so deeply, even though he jokes. What can I do to help him feel loved   respected for who he is? Should I intervene when he's misgendered in very public situations/  or by family members? I sure want to...I just don't know if that's helpful or makes it even worse. I've asked him   he tells me that's up to me     The cringe is real     #Sober     2 weeks seems...excessive 

Sorry but idk if you have room to be judging other people's parenting \_()_/

subject3097,"    What could that be?     Lol he still uses it with CoA for low/medium level opponents      True, but he also needed 1.5 years to master gear 4. Also, I think Tankman vs Cracker was kinda like old Luffy all over again lol      Well you also have to factor in that he currently battling much more experienced people that himself, you can't expect him to be holding back     How could he do that without a timeskip ? (Honest question, no sarcasm)     Do you think there's going to be a gear 5 at all?     I think that for Luffy to do that, he'd need at least  another timeskip. We se Zoro training basically every moment he's awake and I believe he's nowhere near Garp  Luffy's next power up  Hello everybody, what do you guys think is Luffy's next power up is going to be
1) A new G4 form

2) G5

3) Awakening 

4) Other

If you can, could you also explain what this new power would work?

Edit: thanks everyone for the replies! 

Seems like a lot of people's sentiment is MG2GA (Make Gear 2 Great Again) but I don't think that would be possible. 

We have to factor in that Luffy is currently punching above his weight by meddling with the Yonko who are both stronger and more experienced than him, so a huge power spike is honestly to be expected.     Robin loosing her battle to her parasitic breasts      Yes exactly And she basically volunteered two episodes ago     Yes, but the difference is that people know about the Nazis, heck a whole channel( History Channel) broadcast are basically looking at the Nazis from different viewpoints      I'm I the only one waiting for Tomoe (book shop beauty) to be drawn by Sagiri?     I think an adult exposing themselves to a 12vyear old would still be pretty illegal  Why is Japan's Imperialist (especially the war crimes) not as ""publicised"" as it should be?  Hello everybody,

I wanted to ask, why isn't Japan's past as well known to general public as say Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy? 

Most people I talk to seem amazed when I try to highlight the fact that Japan has not only a ""victim"" of WW2 but also one of the main aggressors both before and during the conflict.

This comes as a surprise considering acts which are just as  horrible were committed in Japan's Imperialist campaigns over a longer period of time than the other regimes.     I'll just add my two cents here, since you don't even have to be informed on anything to post on here.

1) OP from the review certainly went overboard in most in not all aspects, but I think it's safe to say that based on the Manga so far, the Author does at least like the  idea of a strong military state with a possible outlook on colonisation. 

2) The fact people even think that Imperialism, Colonisation and ""Military"" past are things to be celebrated makes me kinda incredulous. Sure it's fun to hear how great commanders ""annexed territories after great battles"" but I think *state condoned pillaging, raping, brutalisation, murder and many times enslavement of the new populace* describe the aftermath more accurately. 





     Odd but not wrong     If this is sacred geometry as you claim, why mix it with something as profane as a fictional jolly Roger?     Why be so heated though?

I believe either one between 24 and 25  [Fate/Stay Night]        What do you think the awakening/G5 would be like?     Is the .io site a fake or a back up?     What would you think his awakening would be?     Wow that sounds really cool tbb     True but in Enies Lobby he got 2      Yeah I think that's really the main idea behind their alliance. The only scenario I see this happening, though,  is Law dying      Do you think the increasing number of gears also poses and increasing threat on Luffy's own life by reducing his lifespan?     Hmmm I don't know if it would make them great again, I think the Dragon claw would still only be used for melee purposes rather than 1v1     What do you think his awakening would be like?      Hogback!

Dereshishishi      Gurarararara     The closest thing I to this I can remember is Machvise      Sogeking forbade him     Perona 

Zehahahaha     Yup it all makes sense now     Somebody suggested he could transform himself into a giant by inflating his muscles bones and pumping blood faster ( a mix as you said). I'd see this well against Kaido for instance.     But affecting the environment would add a completely new capability to his DF, unlike the other DF awakening we've seen      The thing is that , even 2 Yonko fighting one another wouldn't use their base powers to defeat one another. 
Also u don't think his base power is week just that the people in the new world are freakishly strong       Why would Mihawk do that if Perona was around for even longer than Zoro?     Yeah and Sanji's  locker seems full of... err... handy material     Zoro Zoro Zoro Zoro   One Piece virgins  [removed]     Yeah right, next you'll tell me Sogeking is Usopp     I feel ashamed cause half of the answers on this thread are mine     Gangster Gastino/Caesar Clown

When you enter r/Animemes and they are not lewding lolis    You are all going to jail       I'm actually saying that it's weird how Luffy wasn't able to ""repel"" the attack and instead was swallowed in. If you think that Haki makes the Logia ""touchable"" then it should also imply that you should be able to hit them freely but this might be different for his fruit  Personal reflection on the latest chapter [SPOILER]  [removed]     Yes finally      Erm I don't know, she probably has made other Kuja pirates her bitches tbh     He's very similar to Luffy but I agree he could have done the deed      I'd say Nami too, she's been all around the East Blue on multiple Pirate ships, I'd guess she's had her share of fun too     Yeah, it was a silly assumption to make in the first place and it was also common for older samurai to ""introduce to the ways of the world"" their personal disciples back in Feudal Japan      Hey!

It was the combination of the animation, OST ( *oh the OST*) and the general ultimate betrayal that the characters faced that did it for me.

You can see what I'm talking about  [here](https://youtu.be/ymf-q6M28-g). 

I personally don't think any anime this year could ever top that and would go so far as saying it's been one of the best scenes I've seen in anime in recent years.

subject3183," Help me find this track please...so crack  [removed]  Hey TwoX, I wrote an article on Janay Palmer's attack by Ray Rice. I think you guys may like it.  October is Domestic Violence Awareness Month and the video was pretty shocking. I felt it gave us a look into domestic violence we don't normally see. It also gave us an opportunity to address a scary reality for many woman and men.  
  
I copied and pasted the text below. If you do enjoy it, check it out on Beacon where I published it (crowd sourced journalism, pretty cool check it out anyway). This was one of the first subreddits I subbed to when I first joined,I was so glad to see it existed and was solidly active. I'm really glad I can finally add something substantial (relatively).  Check it out [here](https://www.beaconreader.com/matthew-romagnoli/behind-the-closed-door-a-closer-look-at-janay-palmers-attack-by-ray-ray-ricebb), please, if you liked the article!
  
The only thing lacking from the video of Janay Palmers attack is sound. If there was sound we could have heard how they were having a fight, seemingly like all couples. We could have heard what Rice said when he aggressively got in her face outside the elevator and how she responded. We could have heard the ominous ding of the elevator door closing. We could have heard if Rice made an emotionally abusive or threatening comment as he closed in on her. Then we could have heard the terrifying sound of Rices fist making contact and Palmers head hitting the railing. Thats not how normal couples resolve a conflict, thats how a criminal does.

What else we might have heard though, before entering the elevator, was that the fight may have not been so normal. He very likely could have been verbally abusing her, which possibly was the cause of the confrontation in the first place. We probably would not have heard the lady walking by saying anything either. She very likely told herself it is not my business. Unfortunately domestic violence, or intimate partner violence (IPV), is still considered a private issue. Both of those titles lend themselves toward suggesting its a private matter. There is a private element of domestic violence. Domestic violence happens behind closed doors. That makes it so incredibly frightening and lethally dangerous. The video of Palmers attack, calling it the Ray Rice Video puts the spotlight on him and not the victim further minimizing her, gives us a deliberate look into the actions of an abuser.

Outside the elevator Palmer reaches and mildly slaps Rice after he says something, in an intimidating manner by projecting his face toward her (not to justify any intimate partner violence).The 58, 206 pound Rice doesnt even flinch from her slap. He does not budge an inch, except in her pursuit. He doesnt immediately react and strike her then either. He deliberately follows her to the elevator. Once inside Rice closes in on Palmer. He takes notice of a lady passing the entrance of the elevator and waits for her to pass by completely. He then strikes her the first time, steps back anticipating her reaction and, when she charges him, swings again knocking her out. It looks like something they had been through before. It also looks like he was thinking it through compared to reacting in the heat of the moment. We can only speculate on what we see. Ultimately the reality of what took place is reprehensible.  

This video is a small window into the thought process of an abuser. Often the abuse we see in public is the tip of the iceberg. What happens privately is often far worse. This mere glimpse behind the closed door shows us an ugly, violent, and dangerous reality.

This most likely wasnt the first time an incident of abuse, verbal or physical, transpired between the two. Its very possible it was situational couple violence, which is a type of domestic violence where violent acts occur after escalating from a fight. According to Michael P. Johnson and Joan B. Kelly, situational couple violence lacks the coercive pattern of control seen in other relationships with domestic violence. Their paper, Differentiation Among Intimate Partner Violence (pdf), even says men involved in situational couple violence do not differ from non-violent men in measures of misogyny. Unfortunately, no matter the type, the woman is more likely to sustain an injury from any type of domestic violence.

This video at a minimum sheds light on the issue of abuse in a larger context but demands a far larger response from everyone exposed to it. Behind that closed door is an NFL full of Ray Rices. A recent Daily Beast article exposes an alarmingly long list of offenders within the NFL. As reported in the Dallas News, black women are three times more likely to die at the hands of a partner or ex-partner. According to a study designed by Jacquelyn C. Campbell, a leader in the field, access to a firearm creates a five fold increase in intimate partner homicide. With gun violence already plaguing many of the black communities in America this only compounds the problem. Unsurprisingly, both Plaxico Burress and Aaron Hernandez, the two more well known gun-toting NFL players, both were involved in domestic violence incidents.

Possibly most troubling of all, this hasnt exactly been behind closed doors at all. It only took this horrific video for us to pay attention, which is often the case with marginalized groups. Now, maybe, that the light has been shed we can start taking this issue a bit more seriously and giving it the due attention it deserves. Undoubtedly, its a complex issue with partners often choosing not to press charges and even going on to marry their abusers. The muffled sounds of domestic violence seeping under that closed door can no longer be ignored. If this video has done anything, its opened that door wide and we have seen, quite clearly, what goes on behind it.     

We also would have heard his, probably, nonchalant tone matching his seemingly calm demeanor afterward as he drags her body out of the elevator. Most likely offering some half assed excuse as to why his fiancee is laid out unconscious. Rice has claimed domestic violence is not an issue in his relationship and this was a one time thing. Im skeptical. Maybe it has remained verbal and has not erupted into violence yet. The abuse or control could even have been recently emerging and still unrecognized. Maybe, as a couple, they are in the minority and it is situational couple violence. Either way, even if it is not an issue within his relationship, there is clearly one within the NFL and certainly one within many homes. Now that we have seen how ugly and dangerous it can be, even if it is a one time incident, its an issue that needs to be addressed. 

October is Domestic Violence Awareness Month and we are becoming aware of more incidents of domestic violence seemingly everyday. Its important to be able to recognize the signs of domestic violence or abuse and to take action. Safe Horizon, No More and the National Domestic Violence Hotline offer great resources. Consider making a safety plan to leave if you are the victim in a domestic violence relationship. Some services will help you escape if you feel you can not leave. Look locally for events to help raise awareness and dont hesitate to speak up if you fear someone you may know is trapped in an abusive relationship. The National Domestic Violence Hotline is reached at 1 800-799-SAFE (7233).

  Mid century ads x-post /r/design    26[M4F] looking to bullshit  anyway i enjoy, well love really, good conversation. i don't really want to get into the shit i or you like that much, because that's kind of boring conversation tbh (generic really is the word).  
  
prefer a female, not sure why, just do. i guess i love the woman's mind or something. i'm an attractive guy, a writer, love my job (that's not writing. other than that, you'll have to ask me.  
  
pm for kik
  
  ya know  I love this game. Not too many games to i regularly play for years. And I always look to try and challenge myself, something new, ya know. Recently I went wide with brazil for the cultural win. It was also on a new difficulty, King. It was successful. I was trying to figure out what to do next. Sometimes, going for the old fashioned domination win is just as fun!  
  
Any recommendations on who I should conquer the world with?  [Discussion] Hey, endgame questions...  Hey guys,  
  
I really was looking forward to this game and really was enjoying it. I've really turned into more of a casual MMO player (gamer in general). Half way through leveling my free month finished so I took a few weeks off to let them hammer some bugs out. After that resubbed and started again but kind of lost my oomph for playing. It wasn't so much that I ddin't enjoy the game, I do. It's challenging (which is a breathe of fresh air), i'm loving the crafting/challenge of crafting, and even leveling my tempalr (despite it being a bit easier/semi repetitive at times, can alwayus pick up a new weapon/focus on different skill line, which is awesome). 
  
That said, I like the game. What I'm weary of is the V level grind. Also, from what I'm hearing the endgame theory is a little skewed and you lose the freedom you had leveling with your builkd. I get that there's some obvious changes to make  to be competitive but like everyone wearin clothe seems a bit silly.   
  
I don't know, I guess I'm asking how the endgame is. How's the theroy? How's the reality? How are the trials? Are they raid like and challenging? How's the role o the healer? Also the 4 man group quests, is there room to heal?  I know this game isn't as clear cut with roles, and that's okay, I enjoy it. I guess as a casual player it seems intimidating to grind that much for an endgame that I'm uncertain about. So, help me out deciding to sub for another month (which I mostly likely will, just have enjoyed the leveling process), shed some light on the endgame/your experiences. And anything else ZOS has lined up I guess that I'm not aware of. I'd love to hear about some of your experiences in the trials, I've watched some videos and they do seem pretty cool, I'd just like to hear 1st hand accounts. I guess I don't want only PvP to look forward to. As much as I enjoy it and tend to be good at it, I tend to favor group PvE though. I'm sure I could grow to love PvP though if the pvE got played out.  
  
Anyway thanks for your input, honesty, and help guys! Hope everyone has enjoyed the game as much as I ave so far.

Best,

The deliberation is equally long and seemingly more arduous, resolving in a guilty verdict. Upon leaving the courthouse you overhear a conversation and immediately realize you've made a mistake.  ~~edit:~~  
  
edit2: i've said too much.  Okay, so the upside of Stakes Day...I made $314 profit, tripling my starting money. How'd you do?  I started with $125 in a new DRF Bets account (taking advantage of the sign up bonus which also gave you two free $40 bets, i believe the offer is still live actually)  
  
I hit a p3 starting with palice malice as a single and finishing with Tonalist. I also hit a decent DD starting with Tonalist and finishing with the strong favorite in the 12th race. Other than that I had a couple smaller exactas for $20-$40. The xpressbet guide to the Stakes actually had the trifecta (one of the analysts nailed it).  
  
So anyone else make some money??  ya know, not for nothing...  there are not many games with the persistent appeal of civ. Yeah, sure, I played WoW for years but that was an MMO and had a million expansions. This game still appeals to me and I still play it though, not too many games have that kind of enduring power. It really is something  else that, for years, I've (or it has) kept my interest and continue to want to play this game. Other games I still fire up but not nearly as much or if I do it frequently they have been released in the last 6/12 months.  
  
So, hear hear! This one's for you, Civ 5!  
  
Best,

ps - BE looks pretty cool, although I love the historical element of civ, it should be fun and different.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Hey DRF Bets has a great sign up deal and...  I might be able to make some referral money off it. It's late and I'm going to bed but I'll psot the link and my referral number in the morning.  
  
They are offering $20 wager + $20 wager on the Belmont stakes (might be 40 and 40 iirc). Plus they are offering $125 paid back to you after you wager $125 in the first 30 days. It's a sweet deal, especially with the Stakes coming up.  I'm a big fan of DRF?Xpressbet (and you can call and ask them to switch between the two without much trouble at all).  
  
All I ask is that you wait till tomorrow so I can possibly get teh $#0 or $50 referral (and if I win anything significant ($100+ sounds good) I'll make sure to kick it back, always remember a good deed ;) ).  
  
ANyway, figured I'd let you guys know. Plus, obviously they have their formulator for PP's, which is unparalleled with the databases it gives access to. I really don't think anyone seriously handicapping could use anything else. Just to clarify their PPs might not be as good as Brisnet (which I think are just trumped up with their added ""analysis,"" always felt less is more imho). Formulator though is fantastic. You can really dig and see patterns you wouldn't find anywhere else, unless you have an insane amount of old forms at the house or something, and even then that would be a lot of work.   
  
Also, small update. I know I've mentioned of starting a blog/tutorials to show how to cap and stuff. I'm still working on the website atm but want to start some handicapping tutorials this week, one before the stakes and then one for the stakes. Anyone recommend any good video capturing programs on the cheap/free (preferably)? I'm presuming a game capturing video software would work. Any tips?  Well, I guess I shouldn't be surprised but I'm not sure how it works as an ad    hey mostly do pvp or pvai?  hey what do you guys play?  
  
I play mostly pvp. For a while I had a good group to play with so we did custom games too which were a lot of fun. I find the game can be a little difficult without playing with a friend (or even just someone on vent).  
  
Thoughts or anything? Anyone looking for a partner? I usually play soviets and usually play team (even though random teammates leads to losses and being pretty damn good at 1v1).  Eminem's hosting a new rap battle league...here's the original Smack DVD battles    Great View...while we're at it let's compare UI's and list our addons...    Okay guys, take a breathe. The bots won't be here for long, here's why.  Because Zenimax isn't a bunch of inexperienced idiots. They opened up scripting for modding (to keep with a solid modding community of Skyrim and TES to be honest I don't remember much of a modding for other Elder Scrolls games but, I digress...)   
  
I'm sure they anticipated this would happen.  They knew it would be widespread. They new it would be an issue for gold, items, and everything that could be done to make some money. I'm sure they are going to put a stop to it. Whether they are gathering IP's for permanent bans or coming up with a solution for the end of public dungeon bot camping (after x time in a public dungeon or kills of a boss gold loot turns to 1 ?). Or x number of chat messages over x number of characters 5 times in a row results in a DC/warning for the first offense, I digress.  
  
They aren't stupid. We all agree that they did a pretty damn good job with this game. A lot of us would argue they hit a fucking home run. It isn't like anything I've experienced before really. It is truly its own experience as far as a ""game"" goes *certainly doesn't feel like any game I've played before though). People who make something like that aren't stupid nor short sighted (dat crafting system, lol).  
  
So they certainly anticipated this. They aren't naive. They open up LUA(?) scripting. I'm sure they are aware that botting was going to happen. I'm sure they have some solutions in place. What I reckon they are going for is some sort of solid permanent or semi permanent fix until the problem arises again instead of just putting a band aid after band aid that the botters can figure out how to work around. Instead they implement several changes and a solid fix on top to get rid of 95% of them or make them ineffective in one fell swoop.  this is a little frustrating...  alright, this isn't a bitching post about the verification thing. it is what it is. the $15 nature is a little different but whatever.  
  
so on my way home I grabbed a prepaid visa card and put $16 on it. Figured this will solve it. And now it still isn't going through. I'm wondering if anyone else is having any success/failure with prepaid visa cards.  
  
I don't want to hear the get a bank account shit. I'm currently between jobs/trying to get my business off the ground (cash is tight, don't want it linked monthly to it). Anyway I got a lot of shit going on and was planning on using game time cards.  Looked around everywhere for them and (surprisingly, thought my area would have them) couldn't find any.  
  
I should be getting some money into my paypal account tomorrow from a client and guess i could try that. The whole thing is just a little frustrating. Like I'm trying here Zenimax and just want to play.   
  
Waited years for this game, got a tease, and now...bleh.  well, i'm hopeful...   later this morning, eastern US time.
  
 well it's already 10:20 a.m. EST. we're pretty much into 'later' this morning. So, 'technically...' We should be ready to rock and roll and minute now. . .  
   
ahhh, the worst part is I have no desire to play any other games while waiting.  
  
tick, tock...the mouse ran up the clock...  sooo guys, time to talk about add ons yet? haha  I guess so right? I mean the conversation will happen eventually. Any that I need to have? I honestly enjoy the game as is but are there any that are jsut hard to paly without? I heard there's a pretty good one for combat with floating text that seemed cool, i wouldn't mind seeing my dmg done or an xp bar (preferably an xp bar alternative honestly).  
  
so what are we using? what do we think of them? what have we heard? gossip up boys and girls.  3 day early access is live!  Just bought it on amazon and I'm creating my character now!   
  
yay!  
  
I just creamed my pants maaan....!!!  
  
and i took some melatonin and tart cherry to help me sleep. well it worked, quite well. i fell asleep in my chair at my computer. woke up to the ESO site and longing. and then the amazon thing went through. like what? woot woot!  
  
I fell asleep expecting April 4th. Woke up and in 5 min I was making a character!
  
Edit: I forgot to add that if you want to play send me a PM.  Im not sure where you choose the mega server? But I'm in NYC.

  Just need a little bit more to get myself started...  Hey,  
  
I'm Matt and I'm a recent college grad. I'm trying to get my business started. Me and my girlfriend are looking to start an advertising/marketing business. We have put a ton of work and time into this already (as well as a bunch of our own cash). I'm an English Major/writer and she's and adobe pro. We have a lot of our stuff planned out and built/designed. We have even picked up a few clients to work with to help pay for it along the way. We are trying to hit the ground running though with a full web presence, business cards, listings, a couple of our own adverts, some SEO promotion, some more traditional promotion. We've reached out to local businesses and the local Chamber of Commerce too. We are like right that.    
  
When I first embarked on this trip I had a little bit of money. I thought I could use it to spend the time to write a book and pursue my dream (wouldn't have lasted that long but would have been a start to get some serious writing done for a little bit) or to start our business. I've worked my whole life and I work hard. I enjoy it. I also enjoy applying myself creatively. It is something I do extremely well. I choose to invest everything I could into getting us off the ground. It may have not been pursuing my ""dream"" but it felt like I might be able to craft a life that would lead to living the dream by waking up every day to a profession doing what I love, being creative.  
  
We are planning on doing a Kickstarter possibly but since we are so close to doing it on our own I thought I might try here/start here first.   
  
We planned out the bare minimum of what we need to hit GO and it's $1,500. A figure we are more comfortable with is $2,000 but we'll get by with what we can. Anything would help really and we'd be able to put a few hundred to this or that. We've already invested 1,250 on our own towards some initial web development, Adobe, and networking. 
  
So come help M M Ads get off the ground. Or MMad Ads or MeMa Creative Group. We are still kind of, er, opinionated over the final design/name (so we have a bunch of spec work missing it, it's kind of funny).  
  
We can show you some design work we've done in the past, link you to some of my journalism work if you'd like to see that, show you our driver's licenses if that's what you'd prefer. If you're in NYC and willing to meet up in person we'd love to do that too. Equally importantly if you can send any work our way as a means to generating revenue we are absolutely open to that (Banner ads, Print ads, article/journalism writing, web content, web ads, ad campaigns, local business, corporations). Posting here was a bit of a debate in itself since we both felt it kind of embarrassing that we weren't able to do it totally on our own. The cost of living in the big city and life in general has made it difficult to do so though.  
  
If you are interested send me a PM and I'll message you my/our Paypal. If you'd prefer to meet in person or do it by other means, please just let us know. I wasn't sure if it was best practice to post my Paypal up here but if it is let me know and I'll add it right away. Otherwise I figured it was best to send a PM and we could personally field any questions/alleviate any additional concerns.  
  
Since we aren't starting a typical brick and mortar shop and have invested a lot of time and some of our money we've been able to keep costs low. Just a bit more to get going. We're trying to cut out our niche in the world and make our mark.  
  
Thank you for your time and consideration.   
  
Best,  
  
Matt and Meghan  
  
Sorry for the wall of text wanted to be thorough, upfront, and as honest as possible.
Tl;DR Need another $1,500 to get our advertising/marketing business up and running. Send us a PM.  RELIC!! it's still crashing!  I finally got it working by deleting my subscriptions after the first patch. I finally got in to play a game. Then this most recent patch came out and it's crashing again. It starts up and the somewhere during the loading screens it ""minimizes"" to the start bar but is stuck there. I think it pretty much crashes but I'm not sure if it totally is crashed. Please help...   
  
Guilt trip time: This is one of the few games I LOVE. I played the original COH and thought it was the coolest, most awesome RTS game ever. I waited years for COH2 and love it. I appreciate playing it and all you do for it. I just wish I could play my favorite game...:(   looking for a civ to go wide that's a bit of a challenge?  title sums it up. I'm looking to play a civ and go wide with a bit of a challenge. Not one that makes going wide too easy. I just finished with Brazil and had fun winning culturally. I'd like to possibly use some of the newer civs but it isn't exclusive. I'm also partial to Dido because I had a game where I was playing well and got screwed. Dido I was thinking of going with the shoshone too.  
  
So what say you, /r/civ?  
    
edit:  
So I'm definitely going to try out venice (going wide seems to be part of winning with them and then ethiopia. they are both civs I've wanted to try for a while.  
  
For now though,  

i'm starting up a faith based game, going wide with arabia, that might be challenging (remember a decent religion based going wide strat on here a while ago w/ byzantine) .    
  
I just realized that winning, on a new difficulty (king, cultural win), with Brazil was a challenge in itself. they are a pretty specific, particular civ and i did really well with them. I think the real challenge would be to move up from king and see if I can win, so I think I'm going to try that and maybe go with the Shoshone, they seem interesting to play and are different than how I usually play. I usually go somewhat wide without much fighting/war/army but at the next level past king I'm going to have to really be diverse and use all my benefits and that includes their pathfinder unit.  
  
Thanks for the help/input!  
  
Indonesia is also on my to do list now too, as for India, well, they get the D...in his mouth.  I've been wondering about packaging my work...  I've mostly been working and sending copy as GoogleDocs unless they've provided a template or the place the copy is supposed to end up.  
  
I was wondering how you might package some of your different projects for  your clients.  
  
I was also wondering, do you regularly work with a go to designer for stuff or expect the client to have that taken care of? I do some design work myself so it has made it easier but I avoid the crossover because it can get messy with rates.  Faux News Brings the Truth (catchy eh? Cool vid of something that looks pretty damn near impossible to explain)  This is pretty wild. There's a large glass container and it slides off the counter, to the floor, and shatters. It looks pretty heavy/bigger so it makes me doubtful it was the wind but there is always the possibility of a natural cause. The shape and everything though would make it pretty difficult for a wind gust to move without moving anything else around it (that is if the door to the store was open this time of year too and without noticing that?)  
  
Anyway check it out, cool stuff (relatively).  

http://www.myfoxny.com/story/25053800/store-surveillance-footage-shows-eerie-footage[1]  YSK that if you just click I'm Feeling Lucky at the Google Homepage it will automatically give you a random topic to check out after clicking it a second time.  You leave the search space blank, click I'm Feeling Lucky and it gives you a random topic to check out. Google sort of tells you how you are randomly feeling (could feel? something you should feel something about?).  
  
go check it out, it's pretty cool. I'm feeling Stellar brings up a page about the Hubble Telescope and there's some other cool results.   
  
edit: i know this isn't making or breaking your day. I know it isn't paramount to your existence. It isn't climacteric knowledge. we all browse the net randomly at some point or another. this is different, unique way for you to do so, in a somewhat random fashion, to help you find some new and probably educational things. for it to be truly random use it in incognito mode or clear your browsing history otherwise you'll be directed toward something familiar. use it to learn about something different or brush up on something you know a little bit about.
  Hey, after last patch some guys had problems with the game crashing, i'm one of them, any help?  The game isn't so much crashing. It is still running is just gets stuck minimized. But it only started happening after the last patch. Any ideas on how to fix this?  
  
I can tell it is still running because when I click it to restore it I can hear the ""sega"" thing as it opens up. it just won't open and stay open. sometimes i get a green box momentarily but that's about it.  
  
i really want to play too...  Thoughts on playing king, war, and some other ish...you know how it goes  Just want to say, this was one of the first subreddits I found after joining reddit, one of the reasons I fell in love with reddit, we have an awesome sub...    
  
So I posted here, jesus maybe over a year ago about moving from prince to king. I ended up only playing a game here or there for a while so I kept it on Prince since I was keeping it more fun. One of my main issues was that I played prince really well. I dominated prince, just as is, to the point of having my choice of victory. When you get to King you need to focus your play a bit more, focus on your victory, use your benefits of your civ *thoroughly.*  Also, every element of the game comes into play. One of my big realizations was that I needed to stop focusing or building wonders like I did. They have their place and benefits but like the other elements of the game you need to focus/build the wonders that are relevant to the city, how you're playing, etc.  
  
That also goes for war. I hear people often complain about the end game they have to resort to war. Now I don't know if this sentiment persisted through BNW but you definitely don't need to be in this position. Now on King you're going to go to war at some point and honestly in most games you should probably end up at war. This will avoid that end game war and it's also realistic. War has always been a part of history, particularly in the greatest empires. Going to war at the right times, right points, can be immeasurably beneficial to your civ, and position you to avoid that end game war. It's another added element to King, going to war at the right tim",0

[removed]  Common Historical Inaccuracies in Fantasy Books  Most fantasy takes place in a western medievil world, but you are welcome to discuss fantasy that takes place in other settings. If you do please list the series since these are less common. Also please list whether this is common in 'TV/Movies' or books. 

Fantasy in general:
1. Too Rich: This bugged me about Wheel of Time. Gold isn't money. The white tower was too wealthy. They did not have a big area to draw taxes from. They didn't do anything to earn money and get paid. Set up health clinics? Help farmers grow crops? Help build stuff? Don't give me the 'they accrued wealth over centuries' they spent it too and currency isn't money. It just leads to inflation.

Most people in general is too healthy and too wealthy. 

2. Lack of Disease: Yeah. People didn't bath much. No antibiotics. They just basically ignore this. Plagues were alot more common in the ancient world. 

3. Food for Armies: The armies are too big and can't be fed. How the hell do the Orcs in Lord of the Rings eat? Same with Trollocs? They are huge and likely require alot of calories. 

4. Not enough farmers: In the ancient world I think 90% of the people were involved in growing and producing food. There are a few books where they use magic to improve crop yields, etc.. but they don't talk about it much. 

5. Game of Thrones one: No way you can keep food from spoiling for a 5 year winter. What about trees? if you have a long winter with nothing growing you would cut down a massive number. Sapplings won't grow back that fast? I think plants and animals in a westeros with evolution would be very different. How do boars live through a 5 year winter? What about building repairs? Buildings take alot more damage in the winter. A large part of many summers is repairing them. Who repairs in a 5 year winter?
 

TV/Movies: 
Alot of these I got from Youtube channels The Metatron and Lindyeige

Comstumes
1. Fake Leather Armor: This cheap garbage wouldn't stop anything. 
2. Leather Armband: Makes guys look tough. Useless
3. Backscabbards: Arm isn't long enough to get the sword out and how do you get the thing back in? 
4. Metal Sound when drawing swords: This would mean the scabard is metal and if you used it you would ruin the edge. It actually sounds more like moving furniture on carpets. 
5. Great Helms + Late Medievil Armor: Full plate was not developed until 1420. The Great Helms were 400 years obsolete and used by Crusaders. You can't open in the front and its hard to 
breath in them. 1400s helmets do NOT look as cool. They have beaks in the front. This is so you have more room for your breath. This was likely a big advance, but is rarely talked about. 
6. Chain Coifs: You hit someone upside the head with a lump of iron like a sword you will crack their skill open. They had padding under the coifs. This would not look cool. 
7. Full armor and no helmet: Cause they want you to know who the hero is. Head is the most vulnerable part of your body. 

Environment:
1. Torches: Day time torches? Why? Too many inside. Who lights new ones every 30 minutes? Only modern technology allows torches without alot of smoke. You would die from smoke. Plus you would 
lose night blindness outside. 
2. Dirt Road with 2 dirt lanes: Modern road. If you had a horse pulling a cart, the whole road would be dirt. 

Combat:
1. Arrows are too effective: Yeah they didn't work like artillery like we see in Lord of the Rings. If archers were that effective, why do they have anything else? 

2. Fire Arrows: Arrow would make the arrows go out and the type of arrows needed to light would not be armor piercing. 

3. Archers are not Strong enough: Archers were actually ripped. Warbows require a ton of strength and stamina to pull. They may have been physically stronger than melee soldiers

4. Cavalry Stops: Advantage of cavalry is you move fast and you get to run people down and stomp on them with a horse. Once you stop you are less mobile and people can kill your horse. 

If cavalry stops in the middle of foot soldiers they would get slaughted. Everyone would hit the horse to know them down and then kill them. 

5. Everyone Breaks up: Formation and order defeats armors that break up. When the Romans fought like they did at the beginning of Gladiator they got slaughtered. Their fighting style was designed
to work in an ordered fashion. Gladius is not a slashing weapon and has limited reach. It was a stabbing weapon and most effective in large organized battles. 

6. Water: Don't people get thirsty? There had to be people passing waterskins up through the ranks. You would get incredibly thirsty. 


Late edition: too many people are literate. If you are a scratch farmer or a blacksmith you likely wont be able to read. Paper was rare back then too.   How about a Stickied post with links to authors who post here?  Author Name, link to u/author link to web page. 

I think authors would like this and fans as well. There will be alot of the 'self promotion' authors who post links to a book no one has read. However, I think people will be able to find authors they like. Authors take time out of their day to post on here and often make good contributions to this forum. Authors can just add a reply to their info with links. Periodically a moderator can come in and just add them to the top post. Delete any other posts other than from authors. Limit authors to 1 post each, UNLESS they change their user or website link etc. Its not a self promotion post. If an author makes repeated self promotion posts in the thread take him out of the list at the top. This shouldn't happen too often.

On an ipad so please excuse typos. You get a very small screen. 

1. Didnt Scotland merge with England in the early 1600s when the Queen of England named the King of Scotland her heir? What mechanism allows for separation? Is this a new rule? 

2. If #1 is true, why has there been so little moving around in the UK to the point that Scotland has such a separate identity. In the US people move alot. I have lived in 6 states. There is some identifying by region , but far, far less. The UK is much smaller. I am surprised that there hant been more movement. This movement would decrease Scotland identity. So my assumption people tend to stay closer to home. I went to college 250 miles north, then afyer graduation moved 1000 miles away. This is not uncommon. If I look up people I went to high school with virtually everyone has moved far away and I didnt grow up in a poor area you instictively want to leave.

3. How do you expect to split up the UK national debt? I dont think the rest of the UK will take it all on.

4. From what I read more tax dollars flow into Scotland than out. Is this true? If so how do you plan to make up for it? What are the major issues?

5. Why do Scotts who want to leave, want to leave? Is it more political? South is more conservative? Conservatives in Brittain dont seem to be all that conservative to an American. 

6. Why is the EU more important to you than Southern UK? I am not clear on the issues that lead UK to leave the EU. I dont know alot about the immigration issue which seemed to be the big one. 

7. Wouldnt it cost alot of money to break up? you need to fund a military, lots of governing bodies, etc...

8. If Scotland leaves will you also kick the Queen to the curb?

  What time do the Brexit polls close and when will the vote be tabulated?    If you could found a religion what would it be and what would you worship?    What is your opinion about Smart guns?  would you be concerned if you were issued a gu that only you could fire?

Trading has all of sudden stopped working with my current reset. I am using tampermonkey in chrome. I can't trade with anyone. I am trying to trade with Zebras/Dragons which are all seasons and the trades never fire. I have the resources necessary because I can manually trade. 

I have tried playing with the trigger to see if that fixes it. Everyone else works. I have refreshed. Closed opened Chrome, Enabled disabled Kitten Scientist. Enabled/Disabled trading. Tried trades with others. Trading worked just fine until 2 days ago. I dont know what happened.   Request: Game Layout change  1. Please have all resources that gain and lose resource (such as coins gained from banks and used by scientists) show how much they are gaining and losing plus the %. You will probably need to move them under the resources that use storage.

2. Please put the resources that are not in storage in alphabetical order or some way that makes it easier to find what I need. 

3. Please have the numbers uses commas and an option for scientific notation. Its going to be a while until I need scientific notation, but even at 1m+ of something, its hard to read without commas. 

thanks.   Question about autokrafting and workshop  Autocrafting is when buildings such as banks crafting gold into coins operates? 

I saw a post in chat from Morpheox that says these buildings always take into account the 'multicraft rate'. This is the craft efficiency we get above work bench labelled items crafted right? 

So does this mean that if we also have 1 workshop with +10% autocraft our craft rate is

ItemsCrafted*(1+Autocraft bonus from workshop) * the crafting rate of the building? 

Request for Morpheox: Could you have items like 'coins' that have autocraft on it say how much they are gaining or losing from scientists like you do for the capped items? The screen layout would need to change and they would probably need to move under the items that have storage limits, but its easier to follow. 

  How old does a grave have to be for it to be considered archeology to dig it up instead of grave robbing?    Please Reduce Sailor Requirement for trades  Trading with Ships has limited use. There is a timer and you have to buy supplies which use planks. Its completely useless when you have a large fleet. IT doesn't make sense to leave a large number of Population basically 'idle' as Sailors. We should only need enough sailors to do trades for the supplies we are carrying.

If I am trading 2500 Copper for a few hundred tin. I shouldnt need Sailors for my entire 12 Ship Fleet. There is a cost of 5 Coins every time you add a sailor. So there is a cost built into move them back and forth. I can make the same trade when I have 2 Galleys. Why do I need more sailors with 12? I should only need all the sailors for fights since all ships are sent. 

If you need this many sailors than trading is useless.   Enhancement requests  I have a few.

1. Itsaguess has performance issues: Could be related to how many buildings, resources, toggles are on. This can be improved by having an option with a timer. So you can opt to have this stuff calcualte say every 5-10 seconds. Easiest way to implement this is with a sleep function. So give an option that can have the loops sleep for 5-10 seconds. Then just multiple the resource gain by the time the code slept. 

2. Loops: Not a javascript coder... but if resources and toggle buildings run from multiple loops in the code, this can lead to more resources being used. If its possible to refactor to 1 driver loop with a case statement that calls other functions. That could reduce CPU load. 

3. Heirlooms, diamonds, and any military drops. This shoudl be impacted by attack/power, HP like regular rewards are. Random factor added in is a good idea. 

4. Stats Tab: One that says how many total Legacy you earned is a good one. Lets people compare where they are in chat. Easier to talk. When I hear someone saying I'm at this tech. Whether its worth me going for it depends on how much legacy I have compared to them. 

Some ideas for Stats:
-- current reset length
-- total play time
-- avg reset/max reset time
-- total Legacy
-- max legacy in a reset, avg legacy

5. Achievements: This is more for fun. Doesn't have to add bonuses if you think that would be overpowering. Could add some points with it to compare. 

  Looking for good Fantasy/History related Youtube channels?  I know about a few of them. I am wondering if anyone knows anymore. I am open to a wide variety. The best way to describe what I am  looking for is by listing sites that I like. I am looking for book reviews, etc... More educational channels. I am rather addicted to youtube education channels.

I am also interested in channels that focus on elements in fantasy and historical books/TV Shows that are or are not realistic. The channels below have some videos on that. 

I am open to a wide variety. So please post channels you like.

  Attack Power on Expeditions affect on rewards  Does anyone know the formula? There was some discussion in the chat. For example it looks like hierloom drops and diamond drops are strictly based on % chance per expedition. So maximize expeditions to get more rewards. 

Really looking for a few things
1. formula for how rewards are calculated on fights
2. formula for how strong enemies are (I know there is a random function to add variance). 

Trying to do the following:
1. calculate optimum strategy for rewards. So roughly how many diamonds./heirlooms per hour, rewards for fights and non-fights depending, how many farmers I need to support this to balance it out. 
2. Help decide where to allocate tech. Since military tech increases attack power. Might be a good idea to stop allocating after a while and focus on others depending on where I am in the game. 

I think we can spreadsheet this.
  Fantasy Tropes that are meant to bring realizing, but never actually happened  Just saw some videos on Lindybeige about torches. I thought this was really interesting. 

I am not talking about any fantasy tropes. Just tropes in fantasy that authors add to make you think its a setting in the real time period they are referencing, but is just made up BS.

Here is one about dungeon ceilings. This is something from RPGs.

  What happens if a bound delegate at the Republican/Democratic convention violates the rules and does not vote for required choose on the first ballot or does not show up for the ballot ?  The reporting in the press has been inconsistent on this. I saw some reporters saying this is 'illegal'. I don't think laws govern conventions. I think its against the rules. So what happens if a Trump/Clinton delegate votes for Cruz/Sanders on the first ballot and violates the rules? Do they just throw the vote out and kick the delegate out? 

Is the 'majority rules' on the first ballot based on a majority of delegates that vote or a majority of all delegates? What happens if enough delegates choose not to show up for the first ballot and there are not enough delegates left to give Clinton/Trump a majority?

This is not going to happen. I am just trying to understand the rules better? I am not looking for a political argument here. I am just trying to understand the rules. I have googled it, but I can't find 'consequences on delegates for violating rules or not showing up'.  ELI5: What would happen if a bound delegate at the Democratic/Republican conventions violate the rules and vote for someone they are not supposed to on the first ballot or simply don't show up for the first ballot?  [removed]  Are marketers affected by any bonuses?  I see marketers raise glass, etc... do they get any bonuses? Someone in chat said you get some kind of craft bonus with marketers. Can someone explain? They are very expensive. I want to see if they are worth it.   any reason to build more than one ziggurat or megalith?  I dont see anything in the wiki about benefits of building more?   help understanding metaphysics price ratios?  So per other threads this reduces the costs of buildings. I see 1% for the first one, etc... how does that work? How much does 1% help?   Medic heal formula?  I added a medic. It heals less than 10 HP per round. That is worthless. What is the formula for much a medic heals?   Question about craft efficiency  My craft efficiency is 8%. I have 13 Workbenches
13*.08=1.04 which explains my 2.05 crafts

In leaders I added a level to Elisia which added 5% craft efficiency. 
That got me to a whopping 2.1 crafts. 

It doesn't look like it actually adds to craft efficiency. Instead it just adds 5% to your total. This is misleadng. 

IS this the same effect with the mastery legacy? 
  Efficient way to progress after resetting a few times  Paragon: 164
Karma: 21

So I have hit declining returns. It looks like accumulating Apocrypha for resets should be my next goal and I should go longer on a reset. However, aquiring faith is very slow even if i use most of my kittens in faith and I build up my Chapels.

What do people usually do at this point?   Who is on the roster at Tackle and Guard?  I know about the 3 starters we held over from last year. Newhouse was probably the worst tackle in the league last year. What do they have on the roster? The odds of getting someone you would want to start next season this late in the draft is unlikely. What do they have on the roster? Hopefully its people healthy...   Enhancement Request: Track Wins/Losses Rewards expeditions please?  Its really tedious to try to figure out what to raise HP or Attack and whether its worth adding more of a certain type of units to offset with Farmers. I dont think many people want this to be a monster spreadsheet game where we have to keep typing stuff in. Can we track the following:

1. when we hover over expedition, tell us how much food production we need to attack as soon as Morale hits the mark necessary to attack. I end up having to punch it into a calculator to check to see if its high enough and if i want to adjust farmers. Its a pain. 

2. can you track a log of rewards from expeditions? Such as rewards per fight, rewards per hour and the history of it? This way its easier to measure what we want to do with our troops?

3. Can you track wins/losses as well?   Factories strike me as ridiculously expensive?  What am I missing? You get a 6% craft bonus with a workshop upgrade. That is the same as you get for a workshop? When you open them up they are FAR more expensive than continuing to upgrade your workshop? I have reset 2 before so this is the first time I am moving beyond concrete huts to check out some more stuff in the game.   Enhancement Request: Please show us how long until we have resources to build something like in kittens game  In Kittens game when you hover over something you want to build it shows you how long it will take until you are able to build it. This is a nice convenience thing.   Enhancement Request: Ability to set how much of Shipyards, Foundry, Kiln, etc... to use  This is a feature from Kittens game. Buildings like Smelters, etc... you have a plus/minus sign next to them. You may have 10 levels in them, but may only want to use 5 at that time because the number of resources they require are too high.

With Shipyard since it uses 40 wood/sec I may want to raise it a level, but can't afford to keep it on at all times at that l evel. I may have to switch around workers. Also, i may want to raise it to exclusive use it with 'rush economy' then set it to lower when letting the game run. 

  Wayward Roguelike new early access game to review  The developers have an interesting approach. You can play the game for free on their website... if you like it you can buy the 2.0 version. I have played it for free for years. I think this is a game people will end up liking. It just went up for sale in early access. Its an old school survival roguelike. Its hard. I have played it a while and still suck at it.   Game with kittens scientist crashes periodically in chrome  It goes to an 'awe snap' page. Is there a way to turn on logging in chrome to see if its kitten scientist or something else? 

Also, can someone give me a command i can run from tampermonkey to automatically enable kitten scientist? I can turn on an auto-reload periodically, but kitten scientist always comes up disabled when the page reloads. This is likely the easiest fix.   how do you create a village?  Its not covered in the tutorial. I read the faq. It points to the tutorial. I am guessing you need to buy a certain number of legislators. I have bought 10. Can someone tell me what you do with legislators and how to get a village? Its not covered.   What is the ideal army mix to maximize rewards to attack frequency  If I go all pikeman I get enough morale to attack every 25 seconds. If I add swordsman and knights I attack less, but more attack so bigger rewards. Anyone work out the ideal ratios to maximize rewards/second?   Bug Report: Buildings showing up red  This was a stealth release. At first buildings and techs would show up with red text if your warehouse was not big enough to store resources. This is a nice feature. Now they are red if you dont have enough resources currently. This isnt any differnet than when tehy were grey if you didnt have enough resources currently. 

Please change this to
Greyed out if you dont have enough resources
Red if your storage isnt big enough to stockpile enough resources to build it.   Some questions about the game mechanics from someone who read the wiki  I have not reset. I played last year and reset once, but then lost my save. I am playing again. Instead of writing lots of posts and causing a mess, I'm going to post questions here. Ill probably edit the top post with dates in case I have new ones. I have read the wiki. I am using kitten scientist. 

Trade Ships: I wiki states how much they help with getting titanium in trades zebras. They also increase your storage capacity. Do they help in other ways with trade or anything else? I saw some references (I cant find the link) about how trade ships help with trade success. Was it only referring to titanium or other parts of trades?   There are updates to the game in bitbucket recently but not release?  I see quite a few commits in March and April of this year, but the last release was 9 months ago. Anyone know what is going on? I see a variety of people adding fixes. Are people just pulling the code and running it on their PCs? 

https://bitbucket.org/bloodrizer/kitten-game/commits/all

  Help understanding when to use mints from wiki  http://bloodrizer.ru/games/kittens/wiki/index.php?page=Buildings redirect=no

I dont understand what the catpower cap has to do with mint effectiveness. Mints reduce the amount of catpower/second which reduces how often you can hunt. I dont understand what the 'catpower cap' which I take to mean the total amount of catpower you can store has to do with this?

Also the wiki mentions cap for ivory in the field next to this. This looks incomplete. What was the wiki trying to say?   Please add a way to respec legacy  I am ok if it costs legacy to do so. I did not read the wiki carefully when I did my first prestige. The first two legacy branches i picked were Motivation and Depot. Now that I look at the game, depot is likely one of the last branches I would want to pick. Making a mistake like this early really slows down my game, due to how expensive makes other branches. 

We should lose legacy for respeccing, legacy, but it needs to be available. It takes time to learn the game and the mechanism for increasing cost isn't clear on the game page.   When to prestige?  I prestiged the first time when I had 70 legacy points. Got me about a 10% boost to production. Not a whole lot. The game doesn't tell you how much legacy you get when you prestige. Is there a good number of legacy points? I see some people below wait a month to prestige. That seems like a while. I was able to get up to have the option to prestige in about 8-10 hours.   What mods work with the latest version?  I went here and downloaded some utility  mods. All but one did not work.  got LUA errors when I started the game. I googled that and it said that its not compatible with .12.9 and up. I filted by mods in .11 and .12. How do I find mods that are compatible with the latest version?

  how does the kitten scientist trigger mechanic work?  I am not sure what the values between 0 and 1 actually mean? I lowered my build trigger to .01. My expectation was that it would trigger to build immmediately, but it never built. Can someone help me understand this?   kitten extrapolation not working for me  I played last year. My save game is gone so I started over. I am using both kitten scientist and kitten extrapolation in chrome. tampermonkey shows both kitten extrapolation and kitten scientist running. I have refreshed the page.

The chart about food usage does not show up. I used kitten extrapolation last year and it worked. I dont know what is going on. Tampermonkey is showing its active. I have refreshed. I have run through several years.   cant build town center  I have 20 blocks, 5 structures, and 3 coins. the game shows me meeting all requirements, but the town structure is still greyed out?  Feature Request: Limit animations to improve performance  I am using Chrome. It usually has the best performance. When I get to insane with skip 50 on after 150-200 Waves, I start having performance issues with the game stuttering. 

The same thing happens with a similiar Kongregate Game called Undying Spider. In that game there is an option to 'condense' the animations. I think this game needs the same option. There is just too much going on on the screen. We dont need to see it all. 

Can we get an option to limit the number of blocks displayed on screen? And limit other animations?   Question about darkness  This seems to be the only thing that matters against really tough bosses since they have so much HP, your 'damage' doesn't matter. This reduces damage by a percentage. 

1. Do the bonus elemental damage skills such as bonus damage to universal work with darkness? Not sure since Darkness isn't called 'damage' its a 'reduce'. So 25% extra on that. do you reduce by 25% more?

2. Does Impetus increase the amount of HP reduction from Darkness or is it just for 'damage'?

3. What about skills like incinerate that increases 'damage amplification'?  How to get blueprints and unlock insane?  In Headquarters I see you need more blueprints. I dont see it explained in game how to get them?

How do you unlock insane ? I am up to level 85 on hard. Is it getting to a certain level on hard?   Sharks Game Questions  1. ",0

subject3220,"    Yes You are right. I realized that, when My son, after few minutes said, that this is so boring, and I had to end the work alone ;-)
It was to be fun, and it was... ath the beginning, but then work was tedious.

Great perfection in making junctions.     nice thing made from scrape of wood
     Great looking and well done.
I know how hard is to make 45 degrees junctions in the coners. You've made it perfectly.     I remember such furniture in Poland when there was communism in our country and the people are very poor and they have small houses.

But.. where are You working, so You have a time for such activity ?     nice work, but isn't the roof too short ?
In rain it will be all wet.     First I think-what is so cool in this gokart, but then.. i noticed the cooler:)     How You achieved such nice shape? I'm making cheese too, but I didn't manage yet to create something with so nice shape as Yours ;-)

I recommend something which allow You to listen podcast from the internet.     what do You think ? It is my first post on 'somethingimade', so I'm curious of the others opinions.     Oh. I don't know where You from, but You can buy such doors in shops (on the internet), but it could be expensive way.
You can built them by yourself (there are tutorials on youtube), or, as I do, You can find 'guy which knows how to deal with metal' show him the project, and he will do it. 
Doors are easy to make. Just plate, frame and additional decorations.
     Hi,

Whole projects it's quite easy. You have to remember few things:
- construction is heavy, so it needs to be on reinforced foundations
- pizza/bread oven has to be built from special materials that accumulate the heat. I use fireclay bricks.
- smokehouse hearth and walls shouldn't accumulate heat, so I use normal, cheapest red bricks
- on the back of the construction there is a second heart for smokehouse. It has longer vent/chimney canal to get the colder smoke from fire. I use it to smoke with the smoke with temperature less than 24 degrees (celsius)
- it is important to have good air/smoke flow in smokehouse, so the minium diameter of the chimneys should be 10 cm. 

If You want to build something like this, You have to remember to fire it first without the meat inside and with opened doors. It is because, the walls should be drained from the water (water is in plaster and mortar). If You don't do that, the first somoked will not be so good, and You will have ugly, black stains below the metal doors (it is where the steams will condense - on the metal walls)     Thanks.
My son.. eh, yes, he was in his baby-swimming pool. It was very hot day then.   I want to show smokehouse I've just built (the whole building process).       I've made something like this by myself. Great effect, especiallyin dark room.
Try to move this device around - it still works and gives 3d effect but in a little different way.
You can try this type of holograms with normal PC screen. It gives You larger holograms.     nice one
very raw, I believe that it will be finished soon, yes ?     Oh, someone asked me what is the range of this cannon - it depends :)
If glider is perfectly made, it could fly more than 60 meters.     Toghether with my son, We've made powerfull toy which gives us a lot of fun and it's easy to make.

Looks really great.. And you save a lot of money.     How long does it take to built?
     Almost like in top gear     Nice work. Those lights are LED?      Wow. Interesting idea. Nice to see something original
     By the way, I would like to ask if such junction I'm making on 1:43 should be glued? I'm always putting the glue in such joints, but is this ok ? Does it strengthen the connection or gives nothing at all ?     It depends.

For example, You can take the photo from right angle and hide some imperfections, but I noticed that lacquer/stain/oil defects are more visible on the pictures.

Macro lens also Could give You nice look of the project. On macro You will have low depth of field and You can show what You want to show and hide defects     nice job. What are those cloudy marks on the sides of the table ?      Interesting idea and construction.
Do You burn some of the sides of the wood between the table legs, or it is just some stain on them ?     small project but very interesting work. 
I've subscribed Your channel.      Although it is not in my style but it is astonishing. I even could not imagine how to do that ;-)

Do You have some step-by-step photos available for that work ?     Could You post some picture, or maybe link describing what is 'the dado' ?     Interesting thing with a interesting history background but to be honest, the table surface isn't flat. This could be uncomfortable.      Nice 45 degree junctions.
How You placed it on the wall? with glue ?     too big cracks i my opinion.

You know, that You can get rid of them by mixing underlay lacquer with sanding dust ?     It depends what effect You want to achieve.

If You have nice flat surface, I recommend to use oils.

If You don't have well prepared/smooth surface, or You don't like/have oils, You could use stain. But if this is Your first project I not recommend water mordants but something which is easier to put on for example glaze or color varnish.

Easy to put is also wax, but waxes don't give glossy surfaces.     Do You have/tried hand plane ? 

It's cheap and can give You a flat surface.

But as for rectangular shape.. I don't know if there  is some way to do that with jigsaw/circular saw.     Hi.
Do You consider glaze (I don't know exact word in english, but in my it is called: 'lazura').
I think that You could find the dark one. 
Glazes are very easy to put and don't give bumpy surfaces as some Varnishes.     Very good step-by-step tutorial. I found very interesting how You make the swallowtail junctions.
+ from me.     Great project! 
Could You give a clue how You make the top ? Some special junctions ? It looks very smooth. I'm impressed.     don't be so modest. It's very good work. I see that even connections are made perfectly.

Some time ago I've mounted such stairs bought in Castorama and I must say, that Your are looking better:)      I don't think so. Maybe some scientist but not necessary an engigneer. Engineers write as chicken with claw.     How much does it take to do ?     Great photobomb.
admit it... it wasn't unexpecetd ? You tried to take such photo ? ;-)     ?     how durable is that toy ?     Very nice river. Clean shalow water and beautifull sights.
I see that You have proffesional tools. In my country only few are fishing like this.     what a strange video :)
I hope that any of this creatures wasn't hurt.     Good trick for kids.
I remember that we've done such animations in primary school.     This is something really original and working.
Good job.     can You do it from left to right ?     in fact this isn't so useless..      Thanks for the review I was thinking about to buy something like this.     Great video.

Olive oil isn't bad idea for kitchen wooden things. It's good for people, non poisonous. I'm using it not only for this knife but also in cutting desks projects.     Yes, there was the split, but it was only small crack, not very deep. I decided to leave it.     Great video, great sculptures. They are working pretty fast.

I recommend You to make two simple cheeses.

     Some time ago, when Crimea was Ukrainian (as it should be), I was there and I found the big bridge with two pylons. This bridge was over the living houses and one of the houses was build around one pylon.
So, I guess, that in some country they don't care about living conditions at all.  I can't believe, that this is not a fake.       don't get me wrong, those imprefections doesn't disqualify Your good job ;-)     So now I'm impressed much more.      It looks like proffesional work. Do You use some kind of pattern making that, or all was from Your head ?     I saw that some time ago on YT.
I wonder how strong will be such junction. This bended playwood won't crac after some time ?     strange. This is really something cool but why anyone is upvoting it ?

one question - how durable it is ? I can imagine breaking connections after some time (sooner than later ;-))     it looks very nice. There was a really lot of work to do with all that painting. Good job.     I think You will have some support. You can glue the legs.     Be carefull with finishing Your projects with oil. The wood have to be almost perfectly sanded for that. Oil will reveal all imperfections and it will be devastating to see all Your work turning into something ugly during oiling.

If You want to sand, I recommend orbital sander.
First 120 or 180 then 240 and 300. After that look at the elemenst placing them against the light to see all potential imperfections.

But.. maybe You could use some stain (if You want to change the colour) and after that use the wax. Hm.. ?     great project. Maybe it isn;t the most beautiful but I like such projects where recycled elements are used.
Upvote from me.     It looks like You are doing two things wrong:
- don't use the sandpaper across the grain
- if You are cutting wood, start from the side which will be visible. Those chipping is because this piece of wood was cutted from bottom to top-from invisible part to visible part. In fact those chips were done earlier, by the saw. Sanding just reveal them.     You should post it to lifehack. This is real, and useful hack.     Very nice project. You could however use some sandpaper to mage the edges more smooth. On the photo there can be seen some imperfection on them.     this video is a little bit funny but mostly strange  Oscilloscope Music - Pictures from Sound [for the electronic nerds]    A 4-bit Calculator made in cardboard and marble    Crazy russian su-27 pilot almost..       what it is so funny in this video ?

You know, that You can use other stains ? Some people recommend to use food stain, becouse then You will get transparent blue see.     This is great project. Looks very steampunk.
How much does it cost to build one?     Yes, indeed     I think that Your work is telling what it ment to tell (what You've just described to me). Really good work.     It's funny and very creative. Good job.     1/2/3 are ok, but the others.. not in my taste.
I up voted You     I didn't see Your project before, but I think, that it looks nice. You are using some templates or draw this by free hand ?

I rememeber that my grandparent have an ancient/old device to sharpen knifes which was made of the circural stone with crank which was hanging half-immersed in the water. I always thought that the water was for lubricating but now i see-it was to cool sharpened steel.     Yes, tung oil is good.     Yes, with small file. It was... very boring.     Hi, thanks for comment. 
I don't agree with You in one thing: ""Olive oil will get gross and sticky in a week or so. ""
It;s not true. If You get natural oil - yes it will get sticki and rancid, but not olive oil !
I have several wooden cutting desks finished with olive and they aren't sticky at all. The oldest has more than 3 years and it is still good.
Also, as I said in other comment:
Olive oil isn't bad idea for kitchen wooden things. It's good for people, non poisonous.      Hi, thanks for advice. Vinegar is a good idea but after such bath the knife will have no rust but still there will be bumps and holes in it. Am I right ? What to do with them then ?      Pity that such weak quality of that video, because the musci is really good     it looks scary     hm.. i don't know what to think after this video.

Very nice work especially that You don't have professional tool used in pencil making industry (like lathe). I like when someone don't search for excuses saying that he has no machines/devices and just do something with only what he owns.

apart of that - very nice pencil you make:)     really great work!

Maybe You will consider glueing? It's easy to make and leaves no marks at all.

Staining it's a complicated thing. It depends what effect do You want to have. Flat, gloss, mat surface ? etc.     Yeah I also think that this is great job. What about costs ?     Do You search in gardening shops ? maybe there ?     could You write some more about this gate ? what is the purpose of that?     It's ok. Would it be painted ?

maybe some comment from someone ?     Hi. 
Renovating axe isn't maybe what everyone wants and needs to do, but I've decided to make such tutorial because:
- I've made it :)
- it could be satisfying to watch (especcially with good music)
- it could be helpful for some people not living in the cities
- I wanted to show, that even ordinary tool could be well made/good looking/original and could give a satisfaction to the user

If You have some questions - I'm ready to answer     what is that ?:)     Is it Your's video ?     This patterns - You made it using an electricity ?     Always plus from me for an electronic devices!     Daughter should be proud of You!     I think that this is amazing technology. My dad has cut his finger in such saw, so I think that such is good idea.
thanks for the vid. it was interesting.     Such small votes up. Maybe try on recycling reddit.

plus from me     Good video. I will definitely make such wall for my router. Thanks.     internet is full os such song but still it is funny. Point from me.     This isn't oddly satisfying but oddlyfrustrating ;-)
anyway, point from me     WOW! I want more pic!

Anyway, the bag looks good. I like projects where old things are reused.     Very nice idea. Everybody has a lot of newspapers which goes to the trash. Now they could be reused.  Imagination.. leads to creation of the bedroom lamp for kids. (I've taken almost 5000 photos to make this vid)       Looks good. What type of wood do You choose ?     Wow, this is brave     Funny title. You have to try to post on HOW-TO reddit group as well ;-)     Yes, exactly. Thanks.     Great ;-)
No I don't decide what's interested to You, I just tried to say that 'somethingimade' in this/in my case is not only the finall effect, but also the 'making of' video. This is the whole, and this is why I've added video instead of picture.
     You see The result on The video thumbnail, but The whole proces is interesting.

But hey, listen, I could go on and on about myself - Tell you about my hobbies like reading. How I devour novels within hours of buying one. I could tell you how I absolutely love day dreaming, or that I enjoy long, long walks (Sometimes both at the same time.). My favorite style of music? Geek Rock. Not that you'll hear it from me. Or how I was working with a rocking tech company a few months ago, Nerf Wars were one of many office hazards. If I was embarrassed about the fact, I'd probably try to hide the fact I like gaming, video and table top, but if someone were to ask me. I'd probably let them know. 

You may also hear rumours that I'm a fantastic cook. Not that I'll confirm them, but I'd be lying if I denied them. Haha 

Maybe I could tell you about how I love watching videos from TED.com, or that I really enjoy listening to comedians as I work? Nah. I'll keep that to myself too. How about the fact that I'm a huge comic book geek, and I enjoy telling people about all the easter eggs in the movie we just watched? No no. I might come off as too nerdy if I told you that! 

Ohh I know. How about that I love hiking and camping? A good beer, and a campfire is a good night in my book. Hmm... But if I said that, then you might start thinking I was a rugged outdoorsy type. Which I'm not. I just like certain things like that, I don't do them often enough for my liking though. Ok. Well. I guess I'll keep my mouth shut for now.

- So yeah. Those are just some of things I wont tell you at the moment. Wouldn't want to waste your time eh? Anyway. If you got through all that, I think I'd like to know about you now.

  What does your SO do, that bothers the the heck out of you, but isn't bad enough that you'd ever want to break up over it?    It's not often I get photo's taken of me,this is one of maybe a half dozen I've had in over a year, and my favourite. I'd love to see it drawn!    [WP] You fell asleep normally, but you wake up 500 years later, something happened when you went to sleep that made all humans disappear.    I [24 M] am a massive extrovert. I've moved to a new city where I haven't made any real connections. Today, out of nowhere I just got crushed by this loneliness on my chest all of a sudden. Like I could physically feel it. Any suggestions?  Okay, so a quick run down. I'm new in Toronto. Been here since January. I've made a lot of ""friends"" people who I enjoy spending time with when I can, and they seem to enjoy my company when we're around. I don't put ""friends"" in quotes because they're bad people or anything like that. The opposite. The folks I'm referring too are great! 

But I never get invited out anywhere, and whenever I invite anyone they're often busy. The only time I get any real connection with folks is for dates. I'm really really good with gals. 

But I've never really met anyone who wants to see me regularly, who seems to want more than something physical with me. And I can't stand anymore fwb situations. 

I'm intelligent, I'm friendly, I go out of my way to help people whenever I can, and like I say. People seem to love having me around. But clearly there is something awful about me that no one will tell me about so I can fix it.

This one girl, who has been my best friend since I moved here, she couldn't even make time for me three weeks ago when my grandfather died. The only person who did was a gal I've been seeing, but I've only gotten like two texts from her since then. 

TL:DR People don't ever seem to want to spend time with me or ever think about me, and it's been eight months. I'm alone in this city and it's crushing me.  Whenever someone says ""If you don't have a solution, don't complain"" they never give a solution to make the other person want to not complain.    First we lose Duke for Sgt Hammer, and now we lose Egon for the Medic? Why are starcraft heroes being shunted aside for these basic units?  When I say lose, I know full well we might get these characters. But Sgt Hammer and Medic fill the roles that Edmund Duke and Egon Stentman would. So the /need/ for those characters is much less now.

Now, I have a specific question. I need to create a bunch of SQL queries. I'm going to post them at the end here, and I was just wondering which terms I should look up to accomplish each of these. I'll be working while checking this page, so even if you can only help me with one of the ten, that'd be great. This is the last stretch of my project, and I'm having a wee bit of trouble. Not a ton, but enough that I figured reaching out couldn't hurt. Thank you for your time!

CSS to style your page.

 The main content area must be separated in two divisions where the left division occupies approximately 1/3 of the content area and shows an image of your product and at least one link to a web site where a visitor to your page can purchase the product.

 The right hand side of the content area must contain three clickable tabs so when a visitor to your page clicks on any of the tab, the appropriate content shows up. That functionality must be implemented using Javascript and the DOM discussed in the lecture.

 The third tab must contain a registration form similar to the one shown above. Using Javascript, validate province, postal code, email, password and age. The register now button must show an alert box containing the data entered by the user.

Instructions
Write a function named sleepCheck that takes the parameter numHours

Otherwise (else) if the number of hours of sleep is less than 8, have the computer return ""Get some more shut eye!"";
Then call the function with different hours of sleep

Call the function with 10 hours of sleep, like this: sleepCheck(10);

Me [24 m] with my best first date ever [26 F] She's from a culture that doesn't celebrate homosexuality, she supports it, but because I'm Bi, thinks she will be unable to fulfill me if we're together.  Okay so, we went on a date. It. Was. Stellar. We both had an amazing time. We even went to a pride parade, and she thought it was beautiful! She wishes her home country could celebrate like that. So it's not that she's homophobic. But around the end of the date, she found out I was bi. I didn't think it would be a big deal.

But now she is concerned that she cannot fulfill me in the way I need, and doesn't want to hold me back. This is a case of her just not understanding how it all works, she's even admitted as much, and I don't hold it against her.

And before anyone says ""She's just using this as an excuse to cancel"" /she/ made the second date before she found out about my sexuality. It would have been easier if I just kept my mouth shut, because if I'm with her, that part of me wouldn't matter. I'm happy to be monogamous with one gender or another. 

Can anyone give me advice on how to let her know that that is the case? I've tried saying that I wouldn't need that part of me, but she's so unsure.

subject3232," How do you like your steak drama? Eaten off a model's back? /r/oldschoolcool has an argument over proper preparation.    This drama has a nice balance of malt and hops, but can you really call it craft drama?    So, in retrospect, I realize my bridal shower last year was basically Beetlejuice's wedding scene...    Coconut cream pie I just finished making    Coconut Cream Pie recipe?  So my husband asked me to make coconut cream pie. I've made it before, and it was good, but it's not as good as my mom's. And that recipe is the one recipe she won't share with me, for whatever reason. All I know is that I've seen her preparing to make it before and she uses cream of coconut instead of coconut extract (coco lopez brand) and flaked coconut both in the pastry cream and on top I went on their website, no coconut pie recipe. Does anyone have a really good recipe for this? I have the ingredients (and I got both coconut milk and coconut cream just in case). 

EDIT: so I just decided to try something, as I have to grade a lot of papers today and I know this will take time to cool. Here's what I've done so far: I made a pastry cream by heating 1 can of cream of coconut, 1 cup milk, and 1/3 cup sweetened condensed milk until it simmered. I whisked 5 egg yolks with 1/3 cup sugar and 1/4 cup cornstarch, then I tempered the eggs and cooked the whole mess in a bowl over a pot of hot water a la double boiler till it passed the spoon test and then I beat in 2 tbs of butter until smooth! I blind baked the crust already and cooled it, so now I'm waiting for the pastry cream to set up. I haven't made a pastry cream quite like this before, so I'll update with a picture when it sets (let's hope it sets!). I'm doing a meringue top, so I'll be using those 5 egg whites I separated from the yolks.

My office doesn't have an oven or stove, just microwaves. I have to be in a meeting that lasts from 10-noon, then the lunch is from noon to one. I know mac and cheese can get mushy when you reheat it. I have a crock pot that I can use to keep it warm or reheat it, but I have no idea A) if you can let mac and cheese sit on the ""warm"" or the ""low"" setting for 2 hours without destroying it or B) use it to reheat mac   cheese if I choose to make it tonight instead of early tomorrow morning. I don't care if I make it tonight or in the morning, I'd just like it to be really good. Any advice would be much appreciated!

UPDATE: So It went well! Thanks for all the great advice in this thread! I ended up using Alton Brown's stove top recipe mentioned in the thread, but tweaked it a little by adding a couple of ounces of buttermilk and some different seasoning (nutmeg, smoked paprika, ground tellicherry peppercorns). I cooked it, put it in the crock pot, transported it, and let it sit on low/warm for the two hours until the lunch (added just a little half and half to keep it from drying out). While it turned out a little thicker than I personally prefer, I will say it was absolutely delicious, and everyone loved it (I made a *lot* and there was about one serving left by the end of lunch).

I haven't had a period in over three years. Then Saturday I stopped taking them because we want to try for a pregnancy while the odds are still in my favor.

What horror films do you want to show your future children?  I've seen a lot of horror films, and I watched a lot of horror films as a kid because my parents wanted to share what *they* loved as kids. This involved a lot of the Universal Monster movies, as they were born in the late 30s, but they were also game for later stuff (my mom first showed me ""The Collector"" and ""Straight Jacket"" and ""The Omen"" my dad showed me ""Kingdom of The Spiders"" and ""Motel Hell"" and, if you can believe it, ""Killdozer."") My oldest sister showed me ""Return of the Living Dead"" when I was 9 and I thought it was the funniest thing I'd ever seen at the time. Now that I've started a family, I'm thinking of what I want to share with future kids--and I have no idea. I wonder if they'll be bored with the classics (like Dracula, or The Exorcist, or Invasion of the Body Snatchers, or Freaks, or any other number of movies that I think are amazing), or even bored with anything that doesn't involve CGI.

My advice is don't be afraid of being ""bitchy."" It's all about your delivery. If you talk about it is in a straightforward and caring way, you're not going to be bitchy. If you've set boundaries with him before and he's made an effort, that's a great sign. I would just be honest with him in a moment when you're both feeling calm and have the time to talk about it.      Is she in therapy? If someone gave her the diagnosis of BPD, then I would assume she at least has access--most professionals will not give that diagnosis without extensive contact and testing. She should work on this issue with her therapist. 

She always needs undivided attention or else she feels neglected and unloved

This is a hallmark symptom of BPD--and it's something she can address in therapy. She should look into doing Dialectical Behavior Therapy to address her interpersonal and affect regulation problems. If she's not willing to do so, then you might want to take a break from the relationship. Borderline people often attract either narcissistic or dependent personalities, and you sound a little like you might have issues with the latter. Don't get sucked in--you are not responsible for her feelings.      If you don't like roleplaying, tell her. If it's a deal breaker for her, then she has to deal with it. I can understand why that would make you dread the encounter. I would start with just having a talk with her about it and tell her how it makes you feel.      That's....awkward. If it makes you feel uncomfortable, I would just tell him. See how he reacts. Could be that's how he's showing affection and he doesn't know any better. If he corrects the behavior, that's good. If he gets defensive and refuses, that's a bad sign, IMO.      Oh look, it's bait!     Chill out--if you usually post the source what's your problem with someone pointing out the real source? You should say ""hey, thanks for the source!""     Would love to see that cross section!

Just a small note, in the future get your pan just a little hotter.       Not like it is easy to carry.

I would beg to differ, I used to carry two in my purse and I wasn't even that active. Just change them out every 6 months to make sure you are accounting for wear--but it doesn't sound like you'll go that long without using them. Keep one in your wallet or have her keep a couple in her purse. It's easy.      Nice for a first attempt! It's medium, and could have used a little less time, but this is the first try--you'll nail it next time! Did you butter baste?     I wish you had left some of the crust visible so we could see it! What cut of meat did you use?     Then I'll dump a bucket of ajvar on your head and call you a naughty boy and leave you wanting.      Oven?     Well, just remember that having a kid is a big responsibility--a HUGE responsibility. It's not just a matter of child support, it really changes your life (whether you're wanting a child or not). Probability is on your side, but it's that one time that it fails that can really change everything in your life if abortion is not an option. 

If you don't mind me asking, what are the times when having a condom aren't realistic?      You should know by now that I'm typically overly nice as a mod, even to the jerkfaces that cut up in /r/food.      He was a defensive lineman, but I think he wants that vicarious glory. 

Seriously, though, concussion research and the weird culture of ""play through the pain"" here in Texas gives us both qualms about high school football at this point. It's just not worth it if you end up with brain damage.      Hey now, don't make me spank you with a wet noodle. 

     So, this really boils down to the degree of trust in your relationship. Have you talked through what you would do if you had an accidental pregnancy? if not, I would say double up. If you've had the conversation and she's taking her pills responsibly, then there's a very small chance (and I mean very) that she'll get pregnant. 

When she takes it every day at the same time of day, it's going to work 99% of the time. It's closer to 91% on average because people don't usually take their pills perfectly. My then boyfriend (now husband) and I didn't stop using condoms until we were at a point at which we were very clear about what we would do with a pregnancy. Communication is key! The p",0

You were entered any time you bought school lunch, and since I ate the school lunch everyday, I had pretty good chances.     Independence. As a kid, I HATED going to public school and being told what to do. I know why things have to be that way (10 year old me would probably have not made good decisions), but it was so annoying for me.

I'm only 20 now so address books were basically obsolete by that point, but I still used it a little bit. My senior year of high school, my drama class did a Secret Santa. I watched everyone get cool gifts. Someone in the class names James got two gifts for some reason. My name is Jane. I never got a gift. Someone misread their paper slip and got James 2 gifts. My teacher felt so bad that she dug through her whole office and handed me a huge package of unopened nilla wafers and a funky pen. I appreciated my teacher a lot
     Coldplay is my favorite band and I feel this in my soul. I remember when MX came out and telling my friends they sold out. Even though I liked it, it wasn't /them/ you know? I hated Ghost Stories ngl, most boring album, and everything else is radio filler anymore :'( I know the lyrics to every song they made before that album and I couldn't even tell you 3 songs on Ghost Stories despite owning the CD.  FT: Arceus LF: Diancie  [event6] Hi so I have literally never ever used Reddit before in my life and I've only perused it maybe like 5 times so I'm sorry if this post is not in compliance with your rules, I read them all so I'm doing my best ;-;

I'm a casual player and I just really want Diancie because I think they're cute and I missed the event, but I have an extra Arceus since I have one in each game (Omega Ruby and Y). I don't care about IVs or stats or any of that stuff but I can give you all that info for what I have if you want it.

OT (for both of them): GT
ID No. (both): 08016

Stats in Y: 276, 276, 267, 254, 276 Nature: Bashful
Stats in Omega Ruby: 269, 276,276,255, 256 Nature: Serious

Both, of course, come with the same moves which if you don't already know them are Judgment, Recover, Hyper Beam, and Perish Song.

Okay well hope this is all done right, if not, sorry, just a regular girl wanting a cute Pokemon to feed Pokepuffs to (///A///)      Oooooh, I'm jealous! I didn't have the funds for that, but I'll still be having a huge bar hopping party      Ah, yeah, you're behind me a day then. I'm the 13th. But hey, same year, so we'll still both be gettin turnt next month HEY-OOOOOOOO     So close and yet so far //single tear//     Are you my long lost skeleton war brother/sister/skeleton person??????     Correct     Try again, a little less than twice that age. I'm about to get mega turnt next month if that helps     I have a pretty strong stomach so I didn't puke, but I did gag. Which, for me, is pretty intense. I read the Jolly Rancher story and ate dinner 2 minutes later lol     I love how using extra question marks in a casual online setting for emphasis makes me a cretin. Can you at least come up with anything other than criticizing something that literally doesn't matter at all? And look, I used just one that time since apparently using more than one is a crime against humanity.

But I'm done replying to this so say whatever you want, you win, I guess.     You're right, I'm sorry, question marks and I are going to start marriage counseling first thing tomorrow and I'm going to get help for my drinking problem. My abusive behaviors are tearing our family apart, thanks for your help.     I didn't realize putting * around things made it italicize which is why the first sentence reads funny, I'm still sorta newish to reddit. Its supposed to be two different actions, not one sentence. Your ""contrary opinion"" came across very rude, which is why I read is as anger, and I was disagreeing with you saying it was ""vindictive"" or about random Internet people when I thought it was pretty clear that this person was their friend. I can agree it was a bit harsh, but you didn't say harsh, you said vindictive, two very different things. 

Also, nice low blow insulting my grammar. If you can have a different opinion, than so can I. Also sorry if my reply is inconsistent in organization??? Didn't realize I needed to write a college paper to disagree with someone on reddit. I just write as I think it and my thoughts aren't always organized \_()_/       *comes to a sub about revenge* *gets mad about revenge* ?????? I think the issue is that they thought this person was their friend, not just a ""obscure corner of the internet"", who spoke poorly about them behind their back. Sure, maybe possible jail time is harsh, but they didn't get any and just had a big, annoying, and embarrassing inconvience placed upon them. I've seen and read way worse revenge stories.     That story is both great and terrible, but I also read it last night haha      Cockroaches. I had vivid dreams (still do) so when I had nightmares, they were awful for me. I had one that my mom turned into this giant cockroach and ate our house. I was pretty young (maybe like 4?) so as silly as it sounds, I was terrified. 

Fast forward a few years and while I don't like them, I can breathe normally even if they're in the same room. Mom decides to break me of this phobia at the State Fair by forcing me to hold a Madagascar Hissing Roach. Thankfully, I screamed right before it touched me and everyone was staring at this mother holding her kid by the arm as she's having a panic attack. We got out of there quick. Ever since I get panicky just seeing pictures of them. The more I see on sidewalks at night, the more nervous I get. If I get too close to one, I'll start freaking out. Can take an hour for me to calm down and stop checking every corner, sock, etc. for them.

It's gotten a little better (my boyfriend has helped a lot since instead of getting irritated with me like my mom, he just reassures me everything is okay) but I doubt it'll ever go away completely. Makes night time walks really difficult.

TL;DR Irrational phobia of cockroaches causes me to have hour-long anxiety episodes.     This reply is late but wanted to say that I've seen the cow eye disection at that museum before (I also live in AZ) and good lord, we left an egg out after Easter once by accident and even in the spring, the heat just destroys everything. We found it simply on smell alone. Praying for your poor nose.     I've always been pretty good at getting away with shit, but I do remember when my sister was about 4 (I'm older so I would have been 7) wrote all over the walls with marker, wrote ""jane did this"" (my name) and then tried to blame me for it. The problem with this was that 4 year old handwriting and spelling is very, very different from 7 year old handwriting and spelling.

She was pretty upset while scrubbing the walls.     We have a coffee shop here called Bikini Bean and while I'm sure that says enough, all the girls that work there wear bikinis. The coffee is pretty good, too.     100% Wisconsin Cheese Curds     Every gemini I've met (including myself) talks a lot. But we have the best stories! ;)     People from Arizona are actually all super pale (not tan like people think) because none of us go outside (when it is 115 F, hell no)      Omg saaaaame, I hate them so much in the dark. Freaks me the fuck out every single time. I literally cried when I moved into my current house and our closet doors were literally just giant mirrors.     Not gonna lie, I totally want a bunch of inflatable dragons now     It's even worse when your whole personality revolves around that one skill. Like everyone knows me for two things: art and writing. I'm glad neither stuck with my sister because she showed potential to be better than me at both. I'm still salty about it.     Born and raised in Phoenix here, can confirm that I wear a sweater in anything below 60F (15.5 C)      Of course. That's what sucks about irrational phobias, you know they're stupid and don't make sense, but no matter how many times I tell myself that, I still lose my shit.     I smoked with my mom and sister recently which was a trip. I suspected my mom had been smoking for years and was surprised when I found out my sister did. Sure enough, things came together and badda boom, badda bing.     I don't know if this is really all that weird, but the first and second time I got drunk was at my house, so now I always change clothes when I'm drunk, to keep the legacy going. Every picture of me at a party starts with me in something cute and ends with me in like sweatpants and the weirdest shirt I could find.      It's definately not as interesting as other people's can be, but here goes:

In high school, I never dated much. Had 2 boyfriend's that lasted about 3 months each. Never asked to a school dance, on dates, etc. My first semester of college, I went to my towns local community college because I am broke and I didn't have the most amazing grades. It was late October and I was going to the enrollment office to talk to an advisor about what classes I should take (this is 2014 btw). Being October, there's a shiton of other people there waiting to see advisors. The wait was like 2 hours. I figure, fuck it, I've got no where to be and our enrollment area was connected to our student lounge so there's a bunch of chill nerds just hanging around playing smash.

I decide to watch a game from a little behind everyone else. I'm not very good at playing, but enjoy watching and talking to people who play. I sit next to this sorta greasy nerd guy and just start up casual conversation.  Now, I should mention, I had never been to this lounge area before. Our campus was under construction for several years and our enrollment office moved locations every damn semester. This wasn't a place I probably would have ever gone to on my own. Why I decided to just wait the 2 hours and not come back in the morning, I'm not sure. But from behind me and greasy nerd guy, walks up some cute blonde guy, asking the nerd guy for the math notes from the math class he had missed.

And what caught me first? Cute blonde guy is wearing a green sweater that is almost IDENTICAL to the one I'm wearing.

 So after, of course, freaking out about our matching green sweaters, we proceed to talk for the next almost 3 hours (the wait was way longer than predicted) and almost missed seeing the advisor. I learn this handsome boy's name is Jake, we are both obsessed with Legend of Zelda, anime, coffee, little eateries, etc. and the rest is history. We saw Big Hero 6 on our first date. We now live together and our 2 year anniversary will be November 28th :)

TL;DR: Met cute guy at school with matching sweater that had the same nerd interests as me, and coming up on 2 years together.     Ability to carry all that heavy, large stuff without needing to use much space.     DON'T HURT ME     I read somewhere that art and music were part of the original Greek games. As an artist I would LOVE to see artists compete in some way or another. I have an idea of how they could do it, but any sort of support for the arts would be amazing.     I'm sooo late to this thread but as someone who really loves music, here are the ones that are either just sad, creepy, haunting, etc. that always get to me (no particular order):

A lot of stuff by Coldplay since they're my favorite band buuuut

A Rush of Blood to The Head - Coldplay 
Girl With One Eye - Florence + The Machine 
Landfill - Daughter 
As My Guitar Gently Weeps - The Beatles
The Scientist - Coldplay 
Bigger, Stronger - Coldplay 
Gasoline - Halsey
Like Real People Do - Hozier 
Useless - Anarbor 
Everywhere I Go - Lissie
Goodnight Moon - Go Radio

Honestly, I could probably list a million songs but this is a good start (if anyone even sees this lol)


     Um...are you dating my boyfriend too?!      I was surprised to find that I often remembered more basic art history knowledge than a lot of my art teachers. My drawing teacher even asked me about images sometimes when talking to the class for more back up info. But I certainly wouldn't say I know a LOT more, just maybe more than the average person, and only because I retain knowledge and memories well.      White 20 year old girl who works as a peppy waitress at an Olive Garden, is going to school for art, and I FUCKING LOVE pumpkin spice stuff. I also wear a lot of mauve colored lipstick.     Literally me. I was such a die hard my senior year of high school. Didn't shave and yelled at anyone who questioned it (I'm a girl), angrily hated on America on my Tumblr, thought republicans were all horroble people, etc etc. The sort of feeling you get when you step off the super lib train is so refreshing because it's hard to be angry all the time. Plus my armpits feel so much better now.     I used to think that annoying, over-bearing and judgmental vegans were a minority. Until my sister watched some super biased documentary that obviously twisted information and statistics into their favor and decided to become one. I sent her one joke about it (Being a vegan is a big missed steak) and she literally just flipped her shit on me. All of her friends are just as bad and I can't stand it. Now that I know a bunch, they're all just so pretentious about it.     My younger sister is an annoying brat. Stuck up, self righteous, know it all, and vain. But I would give my life for hers without blinking. There's this sort of secondary maternal feeling you get for younger siblings when you're the oldest. When my parents were busy, I took care of her. I'm sure if you were to go back in time to that moment and tell your brother right before it happened, he would do it all over again in a heartbeat. He loved you and I'm sure he would be thrilled to know you met the man of your dreams.     Haha its a pretty simple story. And greasy nerd guy was alright, I talked to him about video games for a bit, but he looked and smelled like he hadn't showered in over a week :/ Downside of some nerds, unfortunately. I only saw him around at school maybe once or twice, but he was playing his 3DS so didn't bother him.     Stupid high school me believed some lady trying to return random stuff to a Wal Mart without a receipt or ID, believed that she needed money for her daughters birthday. 2 seconds after agreeing to help her, I realized she was trying to return shit she stole, but I was already getting in line with her with my ID. Good thing I pretty much only shop at Target now. Bitch walked out of there with like $150 and didn't even hand me a $5.     US Olympic swimmer who lied about being mugged in Rio just to get attention/press.      Reading. I have ADHD and it's really difficult for me to stay focused on one task or complete projects. Books with good, interesting content allow me to focus on something for a long period of time, and being able to actually complete something really motivates me.     Cheating on your partner, having ""side hoes"", etc etc. The normalization of abusive relationships too. The amount of memes I see about partners being posessive, jealous, and paranoid is just straight up disgusting and sad. This isn't healthy and it shouldn't be the norm, stop making it into a joke.     My mom grew up in northern Wisconsin on the edge of Lake Superior (if anyone knows where Washburn is, it is beautiful and my grandfather was county sheriff for like 25 or so years) and they also had bagged milk. Seems the really northern parts of the US actually get some of that Canadian culture you guys seem to think doesn't exist. All my relatives there have the accent too.     I always had a really open line of communication with my parents, so it never bothered me because they pretty much knew everything I was already doing and were okay with it (they understand that 20 is a pretty normal age to be having sex, drinking, and maybe the occasional joint) so I never had to worry about asking them to leave or stay. I think the way the nurse posed the question, ""I'm going to be asking personal questions"" instead of like ""I'm going to be asking you about drugs and sex"" was a good idea. And parents should also understand that if their child needs them to leave, it is for their best health interest.

I saw some story once about a girl who was ill from an early pregnancy that was having complications, and the doctors couldn't figure out what was wrong because she INSISTED she wasn't sexually active because her parents were there the whole time. Her brother finally went off on his parents about how they need to accept their daughter is an adult (she was like 22) and that she could be having sex. She finally told them the truth and they managed to save both her and the baby.

TL;DR parents need to respect their child's medical confidentiality, regardless of personal belief     It might be more affective to tap the 'k' key three times     Yeah I was super supportive of my sister other than the occasional joke (because we're siblongs, it's what we do) until I realized she only does it because she has a superiority complex and is just doing what everyone else is. I'm just waiting for her to become an anti-vaxx, gluten-free super lib at this point.

And I love garden burgers, they're super flippin delicious, especially if you get a veggie patty. My best friend is a vegetarian due to medical issues and she's super chill about it, knows all the good recipes haha     ""See you later."" (Midna, Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess)

Maybe not the MOST depressing video game moment ever, but damn, Midna was so cool and seeing her shatter the Mirror of Twilight and after all of her character development...damn. Also Fi at the end of Skyward Swoed, but her annoyingness made it a little less emotional.      I can't even imagine the insecurity issues you must have to be jealous of a 9 and 12 year old. I just don't get how she couldn't figure out it was probably genetic, considering all 3 of us looked like that.      I need a drink     Some background on my family: Fast metabolisms and tallness are common genetic traits in my family. My mom and sister are both 6 feet tall (I'm 5'7"") and all 3 of us are around 120 lbs. We are perfectly healthy and have no eating issues, our bodies just do not hold onto weight.

So anywho, my mom, sister (9), and I (12) were at a Kohl's trying on clothes in one of the dressing room stalls. We were laughing and being loud because my mom was trying on this really ugly shirt and a woman overheard us and asked if she could see what the fuss was about. As odd as this is, my mom opens the door to show her the shirt and the lady goes off about how sad it is that my mother is starving not only herself, but her two children. Calls us disgusting, diseased, etc. Even tells us she wouldn't let us into her classroom (meaning she's a teacher to young children). We were so shocked we couldn't even respond. My mom just closed the stall and the lady walked away. It was the first time I cursed in front of my mom and didn't get in trouble (I called her a bitch). 

Fucked with my self image a lot growing up, can't even imagine how my sister took it.     I mean, at least he hired a prostitute instead of trying to fuck his ACTUAL son...     What the hell a black hole really is and what happens when you go in one. They're so mysterious and terrifying right now. I'd love for them to be solved (although probably even more terrifying)     Only thing that's worked for me is ginger tablets. MythBusters actually did an episode on motion sickness ""fixes"" and found that the ginger tablets were the only thing that worked, too. Hell of a pill to swallow, but worth a shot.     Friend of mine helped me make an account some time ago, but I couldn't get used to the layout and format of Reddit. Then after I left my Tumblr, I was craving a social media site that wasn't the usual Facebook/Twitter, and my boyfriend reintroduced me to Reddit. Funny enough, /AskReddit and /ama are what made me stay, I love reading and sharing stories with people.      Same here. So many people are surprised when I tell them because they'll know me for months without knowing I'm an atheist, and a big one at that. It's too annoying to be associated with the idiots on YouTube and in /r/atheism to bother. I just want everyone to believe what they believe and have a good time.     Orange is The New Black, season 4, episodes 12 and 13. I didn't have any spoilers or forewarning that what was coming was going to happen so it absolutely davastated me. It felt like I'd lost a family member and I cried for probably 3 hours. I almost called out of work. Now, in hindsight, I'm not happy with how season 4 turned out at all, but fuck if that didn't still get me.     I probably spend more energy arguing with asshole atheists who are bullying peaceful, religious people than I do getting mad at overly religious people.      I wish I wasn't so late to this thread because boy do I have some good ones living in Mormon occupied AZ. Lynnesy (pronounced like Lindsey) is easily one of the more annoying. A friend of mine knew a girl who was named Mary Christmas and I know probably 8 different ways to spell the name Kaitlin. (Katlynn, Kaytlin, Kaytlyn, Kaitlyn, etc.) But I think my favorite one has got to be the girl whose last name was 'Joy' and her first name was Tearsof. Tears of Joy. Like WHY     Thank you!!     Thank you!  Sunflower Houses, charcoal, 18"" x 22""     Day 7,641 of having perfectly intact bones  Also hello, I'm new to this sub and all of you make me laugh so thanks for that and doot doot praise skeletal.     And did you vote in the primaries? I agree we both had shit choices, but I'd hope you'd vote for a new Republican candidate over reelecting Trump.     You completely missed my point. WHAT IF??? What if you DIDN'T have health insurance through your job? Like my parents, who own their own business. They don't get health insurance through anything. They have to buy it directly from the companies. And I'm not saying to vote Dem, I'm saying to vote for a candidate that is honest and caring and aligns with your values, regardless of their political affliations. You're voting for a corrupt candidate JUST because he's Republican. There are plenty of good Republican candidates out there who aren't this corrupt.

Stop thinking about yourself and start thinking about the nation and world as a whole. I'm very liberal and I hated Hillary. It isn't about blue and red, it's about integrity.     Aw yes, nothing like some mild Nazism to a mostly innocent question.     And if you lost your full time job? Honestly, it's about a lot more than just you. Kinda sad to hear you don't care about the healthcare issue just because YOU are safe. I get voting Republican, but you've gotta see that Trump is a whole different kind of politician. You should do more research and vote for a good, caring politician with your values, not just say ""oh well"" and vote in a crook again.     Honestly the entire season is shit anyway so yeah, it wasn't justified or worth it at all, which is why I think it was so heartbreaking. If season 5 doesn't astound me, I'm probably done with this show.     As a girl, you really don't have to dirty talk us all. I'm personally not much for it, but it IS sexy to hear your partner moan, curse, grunt, etc. Shows they're  enjoying it. It's kinda awkward to have sex with 0 noise whatsoever  ",0

     Hi /u/Mattximus, 

If you would be so kind as to remove the insult at the end of you comment I would",0
subject3269,"    I have a Faber-Castell pen and even though it was kind of expensive ($100), I love writing with it.  The solid metal feel is way different than the other plastic pens.  I love it.      Sandra Bullock in While You Were Sleeping anyone?     Ok thanks.      Ok cool.  I have read some about creating functions but I don't really understand it yet. Also can I just use c for this or do I have to use c++?  I would like to implement things such as armor and a combat system of some sort.      Thanks again.  I will understand exactly what my code does in the future and understand the underlying concepts.      I will read the chapters that pertain to what I am doing and try to understand it fully.     I also realize that programming, like everything else, is a process.  I know very little about the language and am not trying to get ahead of myself.     Yes I realize that     scanf() takes user input.

I generally understand these concepts.  I am in a computer class at the local community college and was just trying this as an additional exercise to try and get a grasp on the concepts.  I have read the chapters on loops and input and output, etc.     Ok thanks.  Yes I will expand further on the no path.  What I'm wondering is how I get it to ask the user for input again if they press ""p"" for example.  And yes, if I only have one line I do not need the curly braces.      Try C for Dummies.  It's really easy to understand and explains the concepts well.      I swim. ""Blub blub blub!""     Harry Truman was a soldier in World War 1 and fired some of the last shots in the war before the armistice went into effect.

That if I squeeze my chin with my hand as hard as I can for 30 seconds and then flick it, my face would be relieved of stress.  Turns out it doesn't relieve stress, just leaves a huge hickey for days.     Yeah that's always how it is.  Thanks     Yeah boredom and just sitting there not getting anything done are my triggers.  Just get tired of sitting there and give in.     I finally feel like I have a plan when I am tempted.  Thanks so much!     Dude great job!  It's so fulfilling when you don't do it!

Does anyone else want to see a UCS version of Kylo Ren's Shuttle?  I've been thinking about possible UCS TFA sets, and I think Kylo Ren's Shuttle would be really neat.

    if(i==5)
            printf(""Sorry, you cannot enter any more names"");
    else
        {
            printf(""Please enter the name of a friend:\n"");
            scanf(""%s"",  array[i][0]);
            (i++);
        }

After each input it should move to the next line of code for the next name; why doesn't it do that?     Sorry for the formatting issues     OP, nice job on flipping it.

What an intellectual!       Oh sorry yes that is correct     The square root function returns one value for each value plugged in.  I'm not sure what graph you are looking at, but it's not the graph of sqrt(x)     The square root of 49 is 7.  If it were 7 and -7, the square root would not be a function, because then one input would lead to two outputs.     Jazz [1920x1080]       Yeah someone linked the article somewhere up in the thread.

If you could help me fix this that would be fantastic thank you

Edit: I fixed the issue.  For some reason I still cant import pyqt4 from idle, but I will figure it out.  Thanks so much     I have idle, idle2, idle2.7, idle3 and idle3.6 at `/usr/local/bin/idle` and the following line is for the 3.6 version.  Should I just update it to be `#!/usr/local/bin/idle3.6`?

`#!/usr/local/Cellar/python3/3.6.1/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/bin/`
     ok great thanks that all worked and now I can run python from the terminal but when I use IDLE it still doesn't recognize PyQt4.  Do I need to update the path for IDLE as well?     one more quick question... how do I move it to the front of my path.  I think I messed up my python installation once and its been giving me issues since then.  Thanks so much.      /usr/local/bin/python3

yes     apparently I can't format reddit comments either     `which python3` returns `/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/bin/python3` and `echo $PATH` returns `/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/bin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/bin:/Users/parker/anaconda/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/Library/TeX/texbin`     also what is the cartr command it is taking a while to download     Well I checked the 3.6 folder that python puts in my application folder, and it's not there, but when I run which python3 it's says /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/bin/python3. 

I just realized I was checking my Library folder for the frameworks folder earlier and not the one higher up in the directory.  So I did look just now and it is there.       It says it's already installed but not linked. Hm. If I do brew link python it says I should remove it /usr/local/bin/2to3 with brew link --overwrite python.  This is over my head lol.      Did you use --force?  My terminal said ""qt is keg only... use brew install --force if you want to install this version""     Right I was thinking about that. I did use --with-python3 and it didn't work. It says pyqt-5.8.2 already installed.  The weird thing is if I go into the python 2.7 folder or the python 3.6 folder pyqt is not there.       100 percent agree.  The RX-7 is such a great looking car.     That's pretty neat!

Keep the tip.   Krysten Ritter       They are. I'm really stumped I've added the PYTHONPATH variable to my bash_profile with the path to python and idle still doesn't recognize it.

So I am trying to install PyQt and use it in IDLE.  When I run python3 from the terminal and type import PyQt4, it imports fine, but when I go to IDLE and write `import PyQt4`, I get 'No module named PyQt4'.  My path is set up correctly and python works fine from the terminal.  I am just wondering if I need to edit the IDLE file in `/usr/local/bin` or something to get IDLE to use the right version of python.  Thanks.  Whale [2880x1800]   ",0
subject3274,"    I personally just went on to destroy the skull crushas, and it worked. The AI seems to be afraid when you have more units than them and they don't even bother attacking you when your troops are wounded. 

So raise some more units and go destroy the orks so you don't have to stay in couronne for 20 turns, I see it as a trial by fire : if you manage to pull it off you're off a great start (and it's a game you can always try and try again if you don't succeed the first time)     They work really well with your men at arms IMO. What I do is that I group my peasant archers, my men at arms and my grail reliquae together on a high position (with the lord and a damsel of life or beast if I have one in this army), and the trebuchets behind.

That way your peasant units won't flee because of the leadership bonus provided by the grail reliquae and the damsel. 

The grail reliquae are really only here so you are ensured your peasants won't run away when they're attacked by the enemy, which happens way too often to my liking. 

Then I just charge them from behind with my OP grail Knights and usually the enemy disband under a minute, unit by unit, charge after charge.

The grail reliquae also isn't bad at fighting, but I prefer keeping him safe, only sending him to fight if an enemy unit managed to pass my wall of men at arms.
     I'm happy for your mom and siblings (and you) that you did this. Remember, your father (and grandfather) have lost the battle. If they really molested and abused your family, there is no chance they're going to escape the law. 

It is sad to see cases like that, but I'm happy you did the right choice.     6.5/10      This is the final stage of capitalism, the climax, and seeing how things are going today we might actually live long enough to see the pinacle of this whole thing come to life.     I remember that during my senior year in university my class went on a trip (for group projects, not really vacations, unfortunately), and a friend and I ended up with 3 girls to do the field work, and oh my God...

They were making stupid jokes and laughing all day long, especially by making fun of other people behind their backs. When me and my friend said something (jokingly, we're not dickheads, or at least I like to think so) about them being really puerile comparing them to 5 years old children, they lost their shit and didn't want to talk for the rest of the trip. Pure-bred b*tches, the funny thing being they were mocking other people for their manners and looks, when they weren't especially sophisticated and eye-candies themselves: girl when your face looks like it's putting your body to sleep you have no right to make fun of other people's appearance     I sense comtempt towards the game series in his sentence, the guy is just so salty about his decision to give the rights up to CDPR instead of getting a cut percentage of the franchise profits. I don't blame him, in 2006 nobody could have imagined than almost 10 years later CDPR would release the biggest success of the fiscal year (and the Game of the Year, two years in a row). 

I hope they put enough budget into the TV show, the worst thing they can do to the Witcher is making it cheap     Hell fucking yeah     True, but they don't have to swing swords and maces all around for several hours on end tho

I'm talking about Knights and professional fighters, not the everyday farmer equipped with rusty plates and blunt blades that was barely able to eat enough everyday.

My point is not to compare the soldiers of today to the swordsmen of the past, it's just to get an idea of the strength required to walk around in chainmail and plate (I didn't see anybody mention the mail in the comments), while having to swing your weapon and not dying.

Fighting a war has changed a lot, I don't see why you would want to compare, that's like putting up a fight between a knight and a prehistoric caveman. My question is not ""who would win in a fight"", it's about the amount of effort the Knights had to provide to be able to move around in their armors.

About the argument of ""we are taller"", once again it has nothing to do with the question. I'm talking strength to body ratio, of course the average human got taller, but our muscles are thinner compared to people in the past, even in pictures from the 19th century you notice a difference vs now.     No.     Pretty cool video, thank you. Apparently most of my opinions about medieval armors were wrong, and now I want one     That's a pretty smart explanation concerning the actual weight of an armor, I didn't even think of that. I know bodybuilders are not the best comparison, maybe a strongman would have been better. It's ""sad"" we'll never know how strong fighters in ancient times were, I see a lot of people here forgetting that most of them were trained from the youngest age to be a fighter, whereas today soldiers and strongmen usually start their intense practice after 18. 

It could be assumed that everyday training in sparring, martial arts and cardio would ultimately have an impact of the physiology and capabilities of a knight/fighter. Not to mention the simple fact about the length of the battles, the ones who survived must have been either really lucky or really strong and resilient dudes.  How strong were knights ?  As I was visiting in a medieval museum this afternoon , I was struck by the size and thickness of medieval chainmails and plate armors (and the size of weapons such as battlehammers and broadswords), and was wondering how strong were the guys wearing and wielding such equipment ?

Were they really really strong or was this is all a sacrifice of combat effectiveness in favor or pure defensive gear ? I know people in ancient times were likely physically stronger than us but hell, even a bodybuilder would struggle moving in all that steel      No deviation for weapons and canons. The only exceptions are the hand canons on the boat, that have a travel time and inertia.     5/10, 6/10 with that smile     This game deserves every bit of its sudden success. I've never played ANY game which had that level of communication and teamplay in it :players are actually talking and working together for once ! 

Add the quickest bug fixing I've ever witnessed to that and it really makes a pleasant game to play. I bought it 2 days ago, and I've been playing the game almost all week end.

I can't wait to see the next major updates and content (weapon and ship customization, more ships, etc...)

Keep it up guys, your game rocks, and it's even more impressive to know it's been developped by only 2 dudes.     It looks like utter shit tbh. Poor design, both in appearance and abilities. Looks like the kind of stuff you'll find in a f2p rip-off.      9/10, easy     Don't pluck your eyebrows that much, cut your hair a little bit shorter (4 or 5 cm max), put out the nose ring, and you're good.

I'd rate you 5/10 in your current state, but you can easily go up to 7/10 in my eyes if you do what I advised before (just my opinion tho) and lose a few kg (but you're not fat at all, don't worry). You have beautiful eyes btw.     Love it, would add some shadows and details to the mask tho     Encore faudrait-il connaitre le nombre (ou la proportion) d'indcis, ne serait-ce mme qu'une estimation. l'OP a fait un bon travail, les tests me paraissent les bons, mais le modle est (de par la nature des variables qu'il a mis dedans) moyennement fiable.      Sly, Jak and Ratchet were the best. It's a shame the first two have fallen into oblivion, I'd love to play some next gen Sly Racoon or Jak game     Wasn't planning to go to sleep anyway     7.5/10, you have beautiful eyes and you're a redhead so it's all good as far as I'm concerned.     4/10      Les rsultats risquent de te surprendre alors, y a un vrai rassemblement des jeunes autour de Mlenchon, et si je ne pouvais pas voter en 2012, l''mulation autour de la prsidentielle m'avait sembl quand mme vachement moins importante qu'aujourd'hui.

Si le FN n'est pas mort c'est surtout parce que ses lecteurs ne sont pas encore morts, mais je prdit pas  ce parti un grand avenir. D'ici a une vingtaine d'annes il aura perdu 50% de son lectorat. (Sans vouloir passer un gros enfoir, c'est juste la dure ralit de la vie, les gens finissent par mourir). Les jeunes sont pour la majorit de gauche ou abstentionnistes, trs peu sont d'extrme droite, je dois en connatre 1 ou 2  tout pter parmi les personnes que j'ai rencontres.     Je suis fils de chef d'entreprise qui gagne 200k par an (j'ai 22 ans) et pourtant je vais sans doute voter Mlenchon (j'hsite encore avec Hamon). JLM est peut tre idaliste comme le disent certains mais je prfre avoir un mec optimiste avec des ides fortes au pouvoir plutt (encore) qu'un mec qui prne l'austrit, la molesse et la soumission aveugle aux banques et aux directives europennes.

Je vais pas la jouer ""lecteur de JLM classique"" avec des phrases  rallonge en essayant de paraitre inutilement intelligent (chose qui me casse les c***** au plus haut point chez ces derniers), mais je peux dj affirmer que JLM est clairement majoritaire dans ma tranche d'ge (les 18-25). J'ai trs trs peu de connaissances qui vont voter autre chose que JLM, et c'est soit Macron, soit Hamon. Je parle par exprience personnelle mais c'est pas illogique de penser que c'est partout pareil (ou presque) chez les jeunes en France.     I don't even have a bun, nor long hair, so no I'm not ""triggered"", I'm just stating the opinion that people should stop caring so much about others' looks and fashion and find something more productive to do in their life than dumb criticism based on appearance.     What about letting people do whatever the fuck they want with their hair ? It's just hair ffs, find something more interesting to do than hating on people that are tying their hair up in a somewhat trendy manner. I agree buns don't look especially good on most men, but unlike insecure child men like you I don't give a fuck about how they decided to shape their hair.      Ils nous prviennent parce que eux a vient de leur arriver et ils ont pas envie que la 6eme puissance mondiale fasse les mmes conneries qu'eux  Noir Dsir - Tu m'donnes le mal [Alt Rock]  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbmCIXxUy58

""Tu m'donnes le mal"" from the 1991 album ""Du ciment sous les plaines"" from the French Rock band Noir dsir     But megastructures are cool man, that's all that matters     I literally burst out man, nice meme      I find it hard to believe you're really asking if you're pretty or not. Of course you are, 9/10     Kill them all. No survivors.     Yes I'm french (as you can probably see from my grammar) :p

Actually I play on a laptop, so purchasing a QWERTY is gonna be more of an inconvenience than anything else. There is also the fact that in France we are USED to use AZERTY keyboard, I don't even know how to make ""-"", ""_"" or special symbols on a QWERTY keyboard. I will post that on the Paradox forums if it is more likely to be read by the devs or the CM :)    AZERTY support ?  Does someone knows whether Paradox is planning to implement an AZRTY keyboard support for their game or not ? I know AZERTY keyboards are not the most common across the world, but I'd appreciate it that the devs add a feature that allows us to map keys according to our liking      Do you care to explain ? Genuine question, I want to know why people hate France so much when it comes to everything except wine and cheese     It shouldn't harm them if you keep the chlorine level low enough. Ducks are pretty tough birds, they can thrive in almost any kind of water as long as there are some tasty algae and micro-animals to eat.

If you go too heavy on the chlorine, these guys will just leave, don't worry about them. It all depends if you wish to keep the ducks to swim in your pool or not (but remember, ducks defecate and urinate as they eat, so I wouldn't swim in a pool that has ducks living on it).

It's up to you, whether you still want these guys around or not. If it's just to give a cleaner aspect to the water, a bit of chlorine won't hurt them in any way, but it is surely going to kill what they feed on :)     This is the most accurate one on this thread yet     Le candidat PC s'appelle quand mme ""Gaylord le Chequer"", c'est sur que ca donne pas forcment envie de voter pour lui      Je crois que tu as tout dit, les tudiants qui passent d'IUT  Facult (ca se retrouve un peu moins chez les gens issus de Prpa, on se demande bien pourquoi) ont le sentiment d'tre ""meilleurs"" grce (ou  cause de) leur background tech qu'on leur a rabch pendant 2 ans en leur disant ""ce qui compte dans la vraie vie (lol), c'est l'aspect pratique !"". D'exprience ceux-ci sont pas meilleurs du tout que le reste de la promo, les premiers de promo sont d'ailleurs trs rarement issus de DUT quand on regarde le classement. 

Des ingnieurs, il y en a des milliers en France, des chercheurs, beaucoup moins. Alors certes l'enseignant de Fac n'est pas forcment un expert absolu dans le domaine qu'il enseigne (la plupart des profs sont d'ailleurs trs souvent assigns  des UE pas tout le temps trs proches de leur domaine d'expertise), mais lui il a fait ses preuves, il a une thse et un post-doc, alors il y a de bonnes chances qu'il soit plus  mme de dfinir ce qu'il doit enseigner  ses tudiants qu'un titulaire de DUT merdique dans le fin fond de la Creuse.

     I actually did it. What's worse is I ran out of the time the first time so I had to do it all again. I also hate invisible blocks now.     I remade the scrolling platform stage 1-4 from Super Mario Bros. 3 as closely as I could. 

Title: 1-4 Reloaded

Theme: Super Mario Bros. 3

World Type: Ground

Course ID: D342-0000-002B-6A33     I figured it was more fun to have the conveyor belt bring you back than have lava. I'm going to have to make another flying boot level but next time incorporate fire shooting.      Ha never thought of that beginning before. Clever level. Also the shells took me a second to understand.     Thanks for trying it out. Yeah you can trigger one of the Bowsers for a boot and fire battle. I didn't intend that but afterward it makes traversing the spikes easier.      Use the giant flying Kuribo's shoe to bounce on saws all the way out of Bowser's lair.

Title: Buzzsaw Bounce

Theme: Super Mario Bros. 3

World Type: Castle

Course ID: 310A-0000-001C-8BDF     Beat it. Like you said, it did feel like a level from Bros 3, although longer and in my opinion requiring more skill than any level in the original game.     Finally beat it. I had to die a lot until I finally figured out each area.     My friend who sucks at Mario came over and made a level that impressed me with how devilish it was.

I had to come back to beat it this afternoon.     It's day 3 now and I'm noticing that level quality is going up overall.

     Clown Cart Chaos: Something about the helmet always makes me lol. I took it slow on the thwomps and let them take out the flying koopas. The toughest part of the level though is maneuvering through the spikes at the end. I don't know why I thought jumping out would help me. 
Anyway, I starred it. Good stuff.      It takes some luck at the beginning. If you can get loose it's a sprint. This game is awesome. I'll try out some of your other ones right now.

A friend of mine posted her kids on Facebook  Big sis wouldn't share       My friend was an extra on Vanilla Sky once. He told me they were instructed not to speak to Tom Cruise at all because he was focused and in character. Well after one of the takes one of the other extras asked Tom if he would read his script. Everyone was grimacing and prepared for the worst, but Tom said he'd read through it, and if it was any good he'd contact him. Then the guy is supposed to have said, ""And don't think just because I gave it to you that you get to be in it because your last movie sucked.""
Then Tom had someone escort him off the set.     Now the main question I have is, how do I make sure I don't have more than I need when building a pc?

Please try out my newest level: CC3A-0000-0060-572C     Cool, fourth try. Once I decided to sprint with the star I beat it. I'll be honest, I do hate the insta-death start on any level, but overall it was  tricky and fun.

Please try mine: CC3A-0000-0060-572C     Create your way to the goal was well set up. Once I got the idea it was enough enough. 

Please try my level: CC3A-0000-0060-572C     2nd try. I starred because of the next to last challenge with the bullet bill. Would be fun to see a whole challenge built around that.

Leave a comment and I will play your level. I'm about to start going down the thread trying some out.     Thanks for giving them a shot. Yeah, Buzzsaw Bounce was slapped together on day 1 so I'd have one out there, but it's a fun enough concept. Stomp the Yard is a concept I'll probably revisit because getting equipped and wreaking havoc is too much fun. And Hurdling Yoshi was meant to be easy, although it takes some trial and error to get there.

What's your NNID?     Thanks, I love the Kuribo's shoe for years so this pushes it more to the extreme.     I starred. Now I need to make my Zelda level haha.

     Any idea why it works?     People are worried about the boos so they fall in accidentally. Makes sense. 

Thanks, I didn't want the enemy placements to be cheap while making sure they're not where the player would want them.      Cool, I liked it. The vines are a good look. Felt similar to a Mario 2 level.

     The aesthetic is great, and the main puzzle was straight out of a real Mario ghost house but with a little twist. It seemed to me that the circular ghosts weren't really in play. Maybe you could tweak it so they are slightly more of a threat. 

I made two today and I'd love if you'd review either:

It is the most fun when you string together all the hits I think.     Can't get the code to work     First try. But I liked it for sure. The multi path reminded me of the first half castle in Bros 3. with the secret flute.

I just posted a new one above you so check it out if you've got a minute.     Nice. I like how the door were set up. The level was short enough that it didn't hurt too bad to end up back at the beginning and I'd learned something each time.

ID: E82B-0000-0045-29BF     Great checkpoint usage. I enjoyed the level overall too. I was able to get away with running along the spikes rather than using the platform during some stretches because there were enough power ups to keep me going.

     First try. The level of difficulty was right on par with a World 5 or 6 in a Mario game.      Beaten. Except for a blind upward jump or two I thought this was well executed. I hit my head and fell down a couple of times but that's all part of it.      Level Title: Rambo's Airship

Description of Gameplay Elements: After impotently hurling my body at Pit of Panga: P-Break yesterday, I decided to create a tutorial level to teach players how to overcome it's first obstacle. You must jump, then kick a shell while in air into a spring and then bounce off the shell and over some spikes. My level helps you build up to it. Let me know if this is helpful or fun at all. I might make other tutorial levels for the seemingly impossible kaizo type challenges that aren't so impossible if you isolate them.

Video: https://youtu.be/SveqwVIOojY 

Section 1: Demonstrates bouncing over the spikes on a Bullet Bill.

Section 2: When you kick a shell into the spring, you will notice that is bounces back raised off the ground. In order to pass the wall you will have to bounce off it while it is off the ground. It helps me to have a running start.

Section 3: Similar to the Pit of Panga start but with a walkway underneath to prevent insta-death. Jump, kick the shell at the spring, bounce off it and over the spikes as the shell rebounds toward you.

Section 4: Same thing, but without training wheels.

Breakable blocks cover the SMB3 goal and Magikoopas surround that. Chaotic, but short, and not nearly as hard as it looks thanks to the infinite fire flowers.     Nice one. I had no idea the axe would disappear like that. It was good platforming overall, like a real level almost.     Made me think. I kept trying to put on the helmet. 

Try mine: CEF4-0000-0069-F7E9     I would love some feedback on my newest level. I will play yours if you leave a comment.

By paths, I meant ways to get to the Yoshi. There are steps, the ice path with a hidden vine, going up via the flying beetle, or bouncing up on the koopas then hitting the other vine. From there bounce on Yoshi across the remaining Koopas to the exit. 

This level was mostly made by my friend who doesn't play much Mario. He made it last week and nobody online beat it at all. So today we sat down together and made it a lot better. Still there are randomly placed fireballs.      Walk in the park. I enjoyed the chaos. Never used Yoshi like that before.

Hectic, yet short and sweet. Get past the Magikoopa defensive line.     I know what you mean, but the idea was to suggest to the player that you bounce off something over the spikes. Most people aren't familiar with kicking the spring into the shell on purpose so I was trying to lead them into that idea.     Thanks a lot for trying it out. I made a proper post at https://www.reddit.com/r/MarioMaker/comments/3m57xz/pit_of_panga_intro_tutorial/ that details each section. There is video as well of a completion if you don't mind spoiling it.      Beaten! Good use of the propeller. Your tips helped me. I had to get by with my mushroom to the end to beat it.

I liked each challenge, especially the extended door puzzle.      Loved the multiple paths without backtracking being necessary. Big plus to me. After the Bowser fight I almost overthought it because I'd blasted the blocks around the door enough that it opened out into the rest of the level. I chose the door, thankfully.

     I will. I got much bet",0
subject3288,"    Might be, might be, but as far as I remember tyrion hasn`t really heard anything about the wall since Joer mormont died, and a lot has happened since then. And besides, I think he`s got his hands full with the impending invasion of westeros. He might not remember about the wall untill it is too late.     Don`t bother reading books, Games workshop has done everything they can to suck peoples wallets dry. Go watch Arch warhammers lore videos.     Nah, Rockstar is just very good at keeping it`s card close. Nobody likes fake leaks and stuff ruining their game, so they keep their cards close.     Hope not. The multiplayer is messed up (at least on ps3) and the controll systems feels so stiff.     yeah, the art needs to be good.      THink you might be on to something. According to the wiki some of the ancient elven cities were shook by trembles/eathquakes and the elves started to kill of the titans. Not too hard to beleive that the blights might have been a response to the elven threat. Only problem I see is the fact that the first blight only happened looooooong after Arlathan was destroyed.     A siege mode is a must, considerign that all the maps I have played in the beta are basically set in a siege background. They way I see the game now is more or less a waste of potential. Running to capture a, b and c and killing som people on the way is not the way to go. Give us progression in the form of siege stages where we first fight for the gate and then proceed to throw the attacked back into the sea (or whatever) or push the defenders back to the keep. Make the battles feels meaningfull.     Seems pretty certain, as if the dagger on tevinter wasn`t a clear enough hint, the statement that they need to hire people Solas doesn`t know basically confirms it. Since we`ve spent 3 games in or around ferelden and Orails, it seems certaint that Tevinter and other places we haven`t seen before will be the setting for the next game. Which si more than fine by me.     Yes. the World of ice and fire mentions strange things happening all across the world during the long night. No reason it wasn`t felt there. Still, since no humans survive there for long we don`t have any sources confirming or denying this. Still, the brindled men, lost cities and wierd rumors sugest that some crazy shit went down there.     Probably wights in the forets and waters. Tormund mentions that they were being followed on their way south of the wall, and the stragglers were dissapearing. A bunch of humans sitting in one place seems like a great opportunity for the white walkers to kill some humies and add to their numbers.     Seems like people misunderstood my question, I`m not asking for similar fantasy books to a song of ice and fire, but lure books like ""The world of ice and fire"". Big coffe table books with art and the history and facts about the universe, like the world of the witcher and the world of thedas books.  (No spoilers) Similar books to The world of ice and fire  The world of ice and fire really got me into these sort of fantasy lore/universe books, telling me all about the history and places of the world. I LOVE twoiaf, and I recently bought The world of the witcher and the world of thedas, which are also very good. Are there any other books like that that you would recomend? Maybe some lore books for the lord of the rings series of warcraft maybe?

Edit: There seems to be some kind of misunderstanding here, I\m NOT asking for similar fantasy series, but for books similar the ""The world of ice and fire"" aka lore/history books about fantasy univeres. I already bought the world of the witcher and the world of thedas, and on another site I was recomended Warcraft chronicles, which seems pretty good.  Other books similar to The world of ice and fire?  [removed]     Hope so. Just unlocked them today.     Yeah, it was bad. Lauged at his Hitler, dictator and ape jokes. The others ware bad. Kinda felt like neither he nor the crows was in the mood. Lacked energy.     How is a Samurai hero supposed to be as strong as a 3 m high fantasy green ape, og as strong as a giantlizard monster?? Warhammer is fantasy, Shogun is not.
Besides, I actually like the heroes and generals in shogun 2 better. In Warhammer I feel that all they do is fight, in Shogun they are given more command options, like setting a regroup point, giving morale boost and such. THe heroes in warhammer are cool, but they are most of the times just oversizes units with some extra abilities.      Yeah, I`m a big warhammer fan but to me warhammer is just a dumbed down total war. Still lots of fun, but God forbid they try to transef the warhammer mechanics to the historical total war series. My biggest fear is that creative assembly will think that because warhammer sales very very good they will think that has to do with the mechanics and dumbed down elemets instead of ""Warhammer"" being the big dealmaker here.     Well they already got their first historical advisor on board, so i somone could figure out who that person is we might learn what time period we are dealing with.     Nah, the dlcs may sell better but I don`t think they are the best ""ever"". Good sales doesn`t have to be good quality (even though they are good).     That would require the single unit mechanic to be transfered from warhammer to shogun, and I doubt they will use anything else than the engines already in place for the older games. Besides, we already have hero units in Shogun 2, just small griups of them. No need for single hero unit when they don`t have any special abilities like in Warhammer.     A ""age of charlemagne"" og ""wrath of sparte "" style dlc set during/ right before the bronze age collapse in 1200 bc, would be a perfect setting. For Attila you could have a dlc set in the 6-700 with the rise of the aravs, or even later with the byzantine- bulgar wars. LOTS of potential here, for both game.     I really hope they make more dlcs/update Rome 2 and Attila. So much potentisal still in those games and eras.!     To be honest, if assassins creed completely dropped the ""animus approach"" and severed all ties to the modern world, and became more like the witcher 3 with rpg elements I would be happy. Imo the best ac game is black flag, and that is the least assasins creedy game yet. I think sticking to the old formluae only holds the series back.     Ancient egypt would be epic! Totally new locaes and characters, and the fact that we know so little about the time period gives the developers a lot of freedom in creating characters, events and buildings. Perhaps we can even travel to Crete and meet the minoans, babylon or nubians on other games or as different locations in the first game?
Besides, black flag was one of the best recived ac games, and that was arguably the least ""assassins creedy"" game ever, and setting the game in ancient Egypts, before the real formations of the assassin and templar orders let`s the developers do more with the franchise instead of binding themselves to the old formulae. Indeed, they have said that they have been inspired by the witcher 3 and it`s great sense of freedom, so this could be very, very good if done right.     Too bad they basiaclly made the citadel 2.0..
Was really hoping for something new and unique, not just reshaded me1. Don`t get me wront, I`m hyped for the game, but I`m just worried that they won`t dare to thread new paths and just stick to the old and known.     Really lush and beautiful jungle planets. Just revathed Avatar for the first time in ages and wow, Pandora is perfect. Also recently bought star wars battlefront, and playing on endor gives me hope that the frostbite 3 engine can give us Pandora like planets.     Me too actually. Most of the planets in me1 were just copy and paste with different colours. Rather want unique planets. But still hoping for more planets and unique planets wich are fun to explore.     They said we could explore 100s of planets... really hope that is true. Would be epic.     http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2016/11/16/what-mass-effect-andromedas-gameplay-takes-from-mass-effect-3s-multiplayer.aspx

Here`s the video. Like the frostbite destruction.
     Dissapointed... The last concept at they showed before the models looked awesome, then they just blew it....
They look like mix of the collector and the hive from Destiny, nothing new or unique at all.... Hpe they have some other cool and interesting new aliens instead of the kett.     Replaying it now, and yeah, it holds up good. Noticable fps dropws on ps3 though, and the loading times along with the elevator trips.....
but besides that it hold up great! Love the mako exploration, and the citadele just looks awesome, especially the vista areas.
     I hope this is true instead of the so called ""leaked"" map.     True, true, but Red dead isn`t GTA, so whatever the rules were with art from gta might not apply to red dead. Besides, the girls from the gta posters, as you said, are just random girls, the characters from the red dead poster are actual, in universe people, so why would rockstar add them if they have nothing to do with Rdr2? No, I believe the poster represents some of the people we will meet in read dead 2.     Nah, if one of the charachters on the poster really is Jogn Marston ( which I still kinda doubht), we won`t see the birth of the west. Somone said that John was about 38yo when he died, so for him to be old enough to be in agang in Rdr2, we can only go back about 20 years, to 1890, when john was about 18. Some of the other charachters on the poster are older than john was in rdr1 so they could be in a game set even earlier, but from the clues we get, along with the fact that we see electric lamps and such I really doubht we will go back in time before the 1890s.     Imagine having a canoe gunfight, you paddling like a crazy while dogding bullets and fighting back against natives or something. Would be epic. Also, if they add fishing and diving we that would add to the hunting mechanism and the water could maybe hide treasure?
And who knows, we might get to fast travel across bodies of water by steamboats, just like we could with trains and stage coaches in rdr1.     Yeah, i think it`s fake too. Maybe at best some of the places on the map might be real in the sense that this might have been som VERY early map concept, but I think the final map will be something else, and not this.     Why doubt it? We see clear native signs in the trailers and the image relase. The dreamcathcer, tha native paddling the canoe, the fact that one of the pople in the 7 gang posse is a native, I beleve we are right to hope for more native americans in the game.     Nah, anything bigger than Blackwater I wouldn`t like. Don`t want wast cities byt open prarie and nature. Smaller towns and trading posts would be fine enough.  Newspapers in Rdr2  One of the little things I really loved about rdr was the newspapers you could buy after major happenings in the game. It fits so perfectly into the game and was both fun and interesting to read.
In my opinion newspapers are a must for rdr2.
Side note: Rockstar really captured the style of writing in the game, as you can see from this New York times article from 1909 concerning a Native uprising: http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9906E1DC1131E733A25753C3A9659C946897D6CF     Really hope they add more Natives in rdr2, what little there was in rdr 1 was cool, but i would love to see more Native camps, maybe somes ambushes as you said, or maybe even a playable Native.      I have recently become aware of the osprey series, the seems to cover a lot of different and interesting periods, but I am not sure how good they are since I can`t find any review/ previews from the book to get a look at the images and writing style. Might just have to buy a book someday to see for myself.
Edit: Scratch that, just did a quick search on youtube and found a lot fo videos that show the books. Seems like the Osprey books are exactly what I want. Only downside is that the books are so small/short, but still.     It seems like the game is dropping kickstarter and steam early access because of massive interest in the game and because the initial backers decided the fund the whole game, all stretch goals and such, and it will apparently release this years. Great success!!     I can`t find any info about them doing some actuall fighting after ther 11-1200s.     Yes, I have been reading about them as well, very interesting history and they continued to be a military order untill the 1500s. But as you stated, they ended up fighting christians instead of fighting heathens and muslims, like the Knights of Malta did. Where there any others crusader orders that continued to fight muslim/ottomans in the renaissance like the Maltese did?     Native Americans.  Any good books on the later crusades or the knights of malta with lots of illustrations and art?  As the title says, I`m looking for books about the later crusades and/or the knights of Malta that has a lot of illustrations and art. Prefferably a coffe table book. I have been reading a lot about the knights of malta and the later crusades lately, and wanted to know if there were any books similar to what I wanted. Lately I have been rading a few coffe tapple/compendium books about Vikings (Wikings at war by Kim hjardar) and also the general military history of Norway (Norges kriger - Wars of Norway). Along the a few ""The world of"" books for different fantasy series (The world of kong, the world of the wticher etc) really got me into these types of books, and now I want to find some similar books about crusaders and the knights of malta ( Though any other historical period is also welcome)  Did any crusader orders continue the fight besides the Knights of malta?  [removed]  Did any pother crusader order besides the Knights of malta continue the fight?  I have been reading a lot about the Knights of Malta (as they came to be known) and what interests me is the fact that even for centuries after the original crusades ended they continued to fight using ships and joing every christian alliance the could. Did any other of the crusader orders continue to fight in the same way as the Knights of Malta did or were they unique?
Side note: Can anyone recoment me some good books about any later crusades and books on the Knights of malta between 1400-1798??     The cold period probably had something to do with it, but I read that the black death was the ultimate reason they left. They were dependent on regular contact with Iceland and Norway, and when the plague hit the population droped massivlet and the ships stopped comming regularly. The fact that a lot of people died in Iceland and Norway (I`ve never heard of the plague hitting Greenland, which is interesing) ment that there were plenty of good farmland raeady for use, and most greenlanders would have prefered the good soil back home. So all the young people went back home to get their piece of land, while the old folk ( as old folks usually do) stayed in greenland, and eventually died out.

Taken form Wikipedia: ""After 1408 not many written records mention the settlers. There is correspondence between the Pope and the Biskop Bertold af Garde from the same year.[13] The Danish Cartographer Claudius Clavus seems to have visited Greenland in 1420, according to documents written by Nicolas Germanus and Henricus Martellus who had access to original cartographic notes and a map by Clavus. Two mathematical manuscripts containing the second chart of the Claudius Clavus map from his journey to Greenland, where he himself mapped the area, were found during the late 20th century by the Danish scholar Bjnbo and Petersen.[14]

In a letter dated 1448 from Rome, Pope Nicholas V prescribed the bishops of Sklholt and Hlar (the two Icelandic episcopal sees) to ensure to provide the inhabitants of Greenland with priests and a bishop, the latter of which they hadn't had in the 30 years since the apparent coming of the heathens when most churches were destroyed and the people taken away as prisoners.[15]

It is probable that the Eastern Settlement was defunct by the middle of the 15th century although no exact date has been established.""     Haven`t read it yet.     Of course if you go back 10 000 years everybody originally came from somewhere else, but it is pretty certain the the original germanic culture and languages developed first in Scandinavia, and the Nordic Bronze age is the earliest attested germanic like culture in Europe.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_peoples#Origins
(I knwo wikipedia isn`t the best source, but they state my points cleary)
But the germanic origins isn`t the maint topic here. I just wondered if anyone had some info about germanic continuity after they left their homelands. I recenlty watched the Beowulf movie, and what interested me is that fact that it is an anglo-saxon story set in Denmark centuries earlier, indicating that the anglo-saxons remebered/brought with them at least parts of their old germanic culture tol britain, and told the stories for houndreds of years after they left. It could seem like they stayed in touch with their germanic brethern back home, and if that is so how did the vikings and the anglo-saxons see eachother when the raid started? Did they understand each other, since they came from the same region years back?
What also interest me is the fact the the Beowulf story gives an insight into scandinavian history that is otherwise blank, the same goes for the Viking sagas who tell of great migrations a long time ago, which we today know to be true.
Of similar interest is the fact that the lombards (langobards) which also came from scandinavia seems to have broguth with them an early form og rune writing, showing their connection to their ancestral homeland.     I`m putting it on the edge here for sure, but evidence shows that the germanic culture originally evolved from the scandinavians in the nordic bronze age, and the germanic languages evolved there as well. of course some nearby locations like northern germany and such we germanic as well, but a lot of the tribes and peoples the are counted as germanic seems to have had their original homeland in scandinavia.  Similarities between the Vikings and the ancient germanic tribes?  Seeing that Scandinavia is the homeland for all germanic peoples, and the fact that most of the germanic tribes that eventually defeated the romans and invaded britain came from scandinavia (Goths, angles, cimbri, burgundians, vandals etc), I just wondered if anybody knew about any cultural or military similarities between these different tribes? I for one know that the viking sagas contain stories dating back to the migration period and the movements of the goths, and that norse and germanic mythology have a lot in common. Are there any other similarities between all these peoples? Did the tribes then left scandinavia and settles in Rome and other places retain their language and remebered their old homeland?  Cultural and military similarities/continuity between the ancient germanic tribes and vikings?

Nice, seems to be a good year for western games, witch RDR2, the rumored far cry western game (that might have a modern day setting) and now this. Fianlly the western gerne is coming back to life.     I read ina history magazine that the narrangessett (?) culture did not catch any of the old world deseases because there seems to have occured some form of intermarriage or contact that gave that group immunity to later diseases.
Also, though our best sources on the norse colonication of america are the saga books, in recent years researchers and historians have started to agree that norse activity probably were much larger in scale and laster longer than what has been the norm untill now.     Of course I would. Go all out historical I say.     THey should, but doubt they want to have to similar type games competing against each other, and the only real difference being that one clings to the assassins title while the other does not. Imo the fact that the best assassins creed game made was black flag just telles me that whenever they decide the not care about assassins they can get really creative and make epic games, and when they go back to their same old formula of assassins in cities (Unity and syndicate) shit hits the fan.     http://gematsu.com/2017/05/rumor-egypt-set-assassins-creed-origins-features-two-protagonists-naval-combat-due-fall     I for one agree, ubi should just drop the entire ""assassins"" plot and go full historical. The Assassins plot and modern day parts are REALLY holding the series back.     YES PLEASE! Was so glad to hear they they reverted their stance on ""no naval combat"". Naval combat in AC3 and Black flag were the best additions to the series in years.

Can`t wait to explore egypt and the mediterannean.
     I`ve read multiple places that it might in fact be a new far cry game. If so, I would still be happy. We need more open world western games, no matter who makes them. Getting both rdr 2 AND a western far cry? Yes please!     New dude.     If one button push in to hard for you then I don`t know waht to say. battle formations are the staple of total war combat, and IMO one of THE best features, both because it adds realism and also because it just looks badass (also it gives the players waaaay more controll of the army)
I for one want more micro, not less. I love warhammer, but it really is total war for dummies.     Gonna be epic if they do a rdr live action trailer, better do it in the style of Hell on Wheels!     I only have the first book, as I understand that the 2nd book is more or less a summary of the first 2 games. I want history, politics, magic and fauna, not the background of various individuals.
Never heard of He-Man and Master of the universe, but I loved the master and commander movie.     Yeah, it`s ""The world of ice and fire"" and I already have it. it was the book that got me into these type of lore/compenidum books in the first place.  Any other World books like ""The world of the witcher""  I`m just rereading the ""World of the witcher"" book, which, for those that don`t know, is a mix of world history, kingdoms, peoples and animals from the witcher universe. I REALLY love these kinds of books, and wonder if you people could add some other video game /fantasy compenduium books of this type. I Already own a few, Like: The world of ice and fire, the world of thedas, Warcraft chornicles and the world of kong. Are there any other of these books for other games or fantasy universes, say lotr or elder scrolls?     Yes. So many features to brought depth to the total war games have been removed over the years, especially in warhammer. Better not do the same to the next historical game.     The warhammer units are by no means more intelligent.     YES! The units in warhammer feel so un-lifelike, and I despise the fact that I have less controll of my empire and armies in warhammer than in any other games. Visually it just a downgrade and a bummer too. Actually giving the order and WATCHING your soldiers get into formations is visually pleasing as well as tactically informative. If they implement this ""system"" in any of the historical games `m gonna be mad.     Yeah I know, the show arya and sansa are just mad.     Arya and sansa. Don`t like them anymore, they way they are abviously going mad and are just as crazy as the other ""bad"" people, but the fans still cheer for them is just stupid. Especially that scene where arya kills walder and sansa kills Ramsay is so obiously just a fan service.     Sci-fi game, not fantasy or historical. I just wanna now if there are any upcomming open world fantasy/medieval rpg games.     Sorry if I wasn`t clear enough, I am aware of all the above mentioned games, but two of them are sci fi (ish) and one is wii game. I am mostly looking for either pc or ps4 games. And what I am looking for are fantasy or medieval games, not sci fi or something similar like horizon is.  Open world fantasy rpg droubt?  Are you people aware of any open world rpg games like the witcher 3, skyrim or dragon age comming any time soon? It seems to me that since the witcher 3 rocked the word there have been no new releases or annuncements of any game like the witcher 3. Right now I can only think about shadow of war, greedfall and bannerlord. Did the epicness of the witcher 3 sacre of all the orher developers? All the new rpgs I can find now are diablo like and top-down games.
EDIT: I just wanna know if there are any upcomming open world fantasy/medieval games comming. Sci-fi games like mass effect and fallout is NOT what I?m looking for.     Was hoping for something new     Ah, you tricked me into work!     https://www.facebook.com/TotalWar/?fref=ts  Owners of blood and gore dlc with get it in warhammer 2 as well.  CA just announced on the facebook site. Sry to lazy to add link, bet somone will do it for me:)
Anyway, this is good news.     I`m happy, this is a beta and the focus shoiuld be on stabilizing the game itself.     Wow, she`s actually hot.      My problem with the paradox games is the lack of combat. Looking at a map is no fun. However, if they can get eugen systems to do the combat, and make the map global, ........     Ruse was by no means as realistic as the wargames are, and wayy more forgivving.     Aoa failed because it wasnt wargame and because it didn`t get enough promo. (And because it`s expensive). Besides, I think most of the eugen fans are history fans, so a fictional fantasy setting had less apeal to many fans. Myself included. WW2 is popular with everybody, and if they make it a wargame game / :) / they will most likely reach a wide audience.     Wonder how they will implement Weapons like the V- series of rockets,  and some of the advanced weaponry that the germans made ""wunderwaffen"". Most of those were never completed, but weapons like the goliath tracked mine could be used by infatry, and the precision guided rocket Frits x.     Guess who's back, back again
(Shady) Hitler's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back,
guess who's back,
guess who's back,
guess who's back
guess who's back
Guess who's back...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVkUvmDQ3HY     Eugen systems have already said that strategic bombers and paratroopers will not be implemented in their games, because paratroopers and bombers were used BEFORE a bettle begun, most to secure or disaple strategic locations. Using the in the midst of battle would be suicide. That said, the less advanced weaondry of ww2 could mean that we might yet seem them in a game.     Good range though. Kil knock out a T-34 at 1600 m range, while the t-34 had to be closer than 700m to damage the tiger. So even a tracked ticker will pose a serious threat, if if it only reaches the front lines before the engine bursts.     There was by no means any lack of technologies in ww2, and a ww2 game would not be simpkified at all. I think (if they really ARE making a ww2 game) they might be on to a winning formlua.     Well it seems I can`t argue agains that opinion...     What u talking bout? I know that the germans are not some kind of super army winning everything. Has it come to this then, everybody who plays as the germans are ""wherboo"" (Whatever that is) ??
     YEEEES! Tiger, Me-262, Newbelwerfers..... beautiful.     ww2 game comming? YEEEES. Been dreaming of that for ages. Can`t wat to go all blitzkrieg on people, use  newbelwerfers, and few tigers and my beloved me-262!
Bring it on,     What, Wargame announced a ww2 game??     Nah, leave rome out of it.     Can`t wait, Egypt setting has me pumped!     Doubt it. They can`t sell all sorts f crazy stuff the way the do in gta 5. Maybe a unque horse, a hat or something, but nothing like gta.     ""Last good game""? More like the only good game.     Or, eberybody starts alive and weel and go on about their buisness, but instead of respawning as humans they spawn as zombies? EH!?     Well it seems we will be getting zombies soon.     At first I thought ""No, cod does it"". Then I heard the noices and thougth ""YES!""  Zombie mode incoming?       Dunno. The honor system kinda worked for John, seing as he was a repentive criminal trying to live a better life, so he could be either good or bad. If however our protagonist in rdr2 is a marshal or some kind of good guy they might use another system. Still, good or bad choices can be made by anyone.     Just because games have been delayed before doens`t mean Rdr 2 will be.     Yeah, they are legends. The music fits the game like a hand in a glove.     Don`t know where all the ""it`s getting delayed"" posts are coming from. There is no reasen at all to assume it will be delayed.  Dead end alley - the western feeling       Make it open from the start or don`t make it at all. I expect to be able to roam around form the get go. No blocks. No nothing stopping me from exploring.     None of these plots seems very likely.     Good chance that we will see a deeper economy in rdr 2. We`ll just have to wait and see.     Gotta beware us sneaky Scandinavians when we go all crazy and live in the forest!     I think there are some newer ones as well, from 2014 I think. Shows native americans and other stuff. Could be from rdr2.
http://www.gamezone.com/news/rumor-red-dead-3-concept-art-leaked-3440323     I think the failed robbery where John was shot involved a steamboat or boat of some kind. I think the ""God"" figure mentions it. And besides, the fact that there are so mant buffalo/bison alive in the trailer suggest an earlier setting than 1906, and the fact that all the towns and stagecoaches are freshly painted and nowhere nearly as old and ""used"" as what we see in rdr.     Sadly, nothing new.     Give how fantastic the music form the teaser was I feel confident that the soundtrack in Rdr2 will be epic.     Not my video, I just subscribe. I also think a lot of the info sounds like BS but he has many good points as well. Worth a watch imo.  Rdr possibly close to finish (?) and focus on native americans       Maybe we`ll see Salladhor Saan have sexy time with the queen?? :)     Sam has it in oldtown.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rchj4oOG4KE     This.     White walkers would be gone in a week (napal, incendiary rounds, nukes). Without knowing the reason for the invasion I don`t know how they would interract with the seven kingdoms.      Yes, we scandinavians are very sneaky. One night we`re sleeping in our bed in Europe, the next we`re invading Asia. Vikings brah. Can`t stop us.     Off map artillery and support confirmed in one of the images.     ""3- Units can surrender""
Vive la france!     Gonna be in the same ""family"" of sorts, but the new phase system and other differences will make it feel different, while still retaining that good wargame feeling.     Me-262 intensifies.     Give them a chance. Still lots of potential for other fronts at a later date.     Because reasons.     They already did 3 cold war/modern games, one ww2 game again won`t mean the end for wargame. Besides, they will most likely continue to support Red dragon with new factions and maps.     Ruhrstahl X-4
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruhrstahl_X-4#X-7_anti-tank_missile     https://media.giphy.com/media/nLkG6MIdzDqhy/giphy.gif     Gliders at least. With the new A,B and C phases gliders and paratrooperd could be used in the A phase to secure postions before the heavy aa and aircraft arrives.     Seems so, but then again to it`s right there are some downed aircraft....     They were never going to be small, that was just som BS said.     Guys you should check out their facebbok page, lots of images from the game itself there!     gtfo.     And all the whiners go can happy to bed knowing that it won`t ""ruin"" the wargame franchise. Win win for everybody.     Yeah, Normandy is kinda the setting of 90 % of all ww2 games, but being a ww2 game there is a lot of potential f",0
subject3297," One of the most bad-ass scenes of any cartoon series and one of my favorite moments from the entire Star Wars franchise - the introduction of General Grievous in Genndy Tartakovsky's ""Clone Wars"" adaptation.    What are your favorite stories in the Star Wars franchise?  Hey everyone, I want to make this post to suggest my favorite stories to those who might be interested, as well as to see what other people would consider to be the best stories in the entire Star Wars franchise. So, here are mine:

* Episodes I-VI of the Star Wars films

* Star Wars: Clone Wars (Tartakovsky's series)

* Star Wars: The Clone Wars (the 3D series)

* The Courtship of Princess Leia

* Rogue One

* Star Wars Legacy

* Knights of the Old Republic 1 and 2

* The Force Unleashed

* The Thrawn Trilogy

* Labyrinth of Evil and the novelization of Revenge of the Sith

So, what are your favorites?   Let's take time to remember how terrifying the Ewoks actually are in the scope of the Star Wars saga.    343, pretty please balance the ground-to-air combat  I don't know what change happened, but it feels like recently the Warzone modes are totally and completely won by Wasps and Banshees as soon as a team is able to spawn them. If there's any way to balance that, I'd be in 100% agreement with that.  Enjoyed Rogue One. It reminded me of a different great Star Wars tale set between the PT and the OT.    Technically, ""Merry Christmas"" is still a correct saying to say for most Americans.  [removed]  Which game should I pick up?  I got some money for a game, and I was wondering if any of you guys happen to have any recommendations. I'm thinking about getting Titanfall 2, battlefield 1, or dead rising 4. Anybody have any high recommendations among those games, or other games of a similar nature?  Chris Tucker's dance in Rush Hour 2 is among my favorite moments in cinema. One of my favorite films    What are your GOTY for 2016?  It's been a crazy year. Really. 

The upside is that we've had a pretty varied and interesting year for video games. Of course, there are still releases waiting to come out, like The Last Guardian and Dead Rising 4, but I'm interested in seeing what everyone else has at the top of their list. So what are your picks for their ""Best Games"" for the year? 

Here are mine:

* Quantum Break
* Deus Ex: Mankind Divided
* Gears of War 4
* SUPERHOT
* Inside  Excellent show!  It's like a cross between ""Firefly"" and ""Dollhouse"" where a space-faring crew have to deal with existentialism and identity, while being pursued by pasts their not fully aware of that takes them to fascinating places as characters. A great main cast with fascinating themes and I was impressed with their ability to kill off characters for the sake of character development and story and not just shock value (shame, Game of Thrones). 

I'm just wrapping up season 2 right now, and I hope season 3 keeps up the stellar quality of writing, mystery, action, and characterizations. This is easily alongside The Expanse as one of the best sci-fi shows in recent memory.  Recommendation on which game I should get?  Hey everyone. I'm looking for a new game and wanted to get people's opinions on what's currently out. I'm interested in a good single-player, but I'd also loved a good multiplayer if there's an active community

I'm deciding between these games, and I'll only be getting one:
* Watch Dogs 2
* Dishonored 2
* Titanfall 2
* Battlefield 1

Thank you for your input!  What movie deserves a remake/reboot/readaptation  We all know that classic films often get updated in Hollywood these days, much to the dismay of fans of those time weathered movies. But what about the films that had potential to be great films, but we're just executed poorly?

""In Time"" starts with an interesting premise of time = money, but never evolves into anything interesting, and character inconsistencies, a lacking plot, and no interesting explored ideas keep it from being a classic sci-fi film. On the other side, films like ""Starship Troopers"" or ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" are noticeably different from their source material, despite being good films (in my opinion) and some they want to see adapted differently so that they stick closer to either the content or the spirit of the source material.

What films would you like to see get a second attempt at life on the silver screen?  Story related question  Do Corvo and/or Emily have their own character arc in the game or do they mostly stay the same as characters until the end?  The ONLY real problem I have with the story options in Witcher 3: Wild Hunt  I just wish the developers could have crafted a way to end the Yen romance BEFORE the Last Wish side-quest since I was dead-set on Triss being my romantic interest. It's hearbreaking to see Yen so destroyed seeing that she still had feelings for Geralt and not have any way to avoid that moment.   I don't hate Jar Jar Binks.  I don't like Jar Jar in The Phantom Menace. I think he's annoying, portrayed as overly incompetent, and a lot of times, his comedic antics are either not funny or inappropriate for the scene. That being said, I don't hate him as a character, and I personally think he gets way too much derision. In Phantom Menace, he helps Obi-Wan and Qui-gon believing that he owes them his life after saving him and keeps to his beliefs even when they tell him that it's not necessary, he's willing to suffer corporal punishment for bringing in outsiders (without knowing whether or not he'd get out of the punishment), and (despite the unnecessary comical moments that don't land AT ALL) he was willing to go INTO COMBAT for what he believed in, especially for the possibility of peace between the Gungans and the Naboo.

There are FAR more characters who I find insultingly irritating as characters who aren't intended to be so: Zach from ""The Strain"" TV show, Bella from the ""Twilight"" films, Marie from ""Breaking Bad,"" Jax from ""Sons of Anarchy,"" Rose from the Metal Gear Solid games (seriously, she's the absolute worst). Jar Jar is poorly written for the most part, but at least he's self-sacrificing, considerate, friendly and brave (when not being an idiot).

Also, can we at least acknowledge that Lucas had enough clarity and respect for the public to dial back Jar Jar to almost absolute zero in episode 2 and 3 because of how he was received?

I know the prequels are all flawed (spectacularly in some instances), but this particular mark stuck out to me. No. Jar Jar is not a great character. He's not even a ""good character"", but at least he has some redeemable qualities to him that I feel that a lot of people don't consider.

I want to fucking punch somebody.

Post-edit: To those saying ""it's sad that you learned something from a movie"", you should understand the concept of ""argument from personal incredulity"".

Post-edit 2: Revolutions - I also genuinely enjoyed the filmmaking that included the editing, sound design, visual presentation, and oddly engrossing juxtaposition between retro long the story and breaking the fourth wall.  This subreddit is incredible  All of these people commenting and leaving their own impressions and perspectives about the games and the books, and it's not rife with ""the games/books are SOOO MUCH BETTER"" argument sections. 

Thank God for a more mature subreddit.  ""Smart Guys"" is one of the funniest and well-made American comedies in years.

This little guy was chasing a squirrel and lodged his head in a tree. He was freed by Fairfax County Animal control.    Who's a favorite small side-character that's always stuck with you?  For me, one of the joys in video game RPGs is discovering smaller characters who just brighten up the world or add something interesting to the game overall, even if they don't have a huge part in the narrative.

One of my favorites has to be Sir Roderick Ponce Von Fontlebottom the Magnificent Bastard from ""Jade Empire"". A pompous and arrogant Englishman extolling the virtues of his home country to the ""uneducated"". Yet, he was also something of a charming rogue who wasn't quite without likable personality.

What about you? Which side-characters do you remember fondly?  What phenomena can't science explain?    Besides fixing bugs and miscellaneous problems, I would ask CD Projekt Red for only ONE more thing for Witcher 3: Wild Hunt as an update  I LOVE Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and its expansions, the only other thing I would ask of the developers would be to allow us the ability to change which background we want for the ""main menu"". You know that part where Geralt is in deep meditation while scrolling the menu? I would love for their to be an option to choose between the vanilla game, Hearts of Stone, and the Blood and Wine versions of Geralt kneeling in deep meditation.  Top 10 Games of the Year....so far...  For me, here's how my list is shaping up:

* Quantum Break (my GOTY at the moment given that terrific time-traveling narrative)
* SUPERHOT
* Doom
* Oxenfree
* That Dragon, Cancer

Special mention to Uncharted 4, Overwatch, and ""Blood and Wine"" (I don't think this one may count, however, given that it's DLC for another game, but it's still AMAZING!!!!)

What about you? What are your choices?  Everything Wrong With ""Everything Wrong With Avengers: Age of Ultron""    Everything Wrong With ""Everything Wrong With Sherlock Holmes""    There's a lot to be excited about with E3. For me? it's returning to smack down some zombies with this goof. He's covered wars, y'know.    New York court allows police to cover up mass surveillance operations    I think that the Marc Webb ""Spider-man"" films were incredibly underrated...  I feel that both of ""The Amazing Spider-man"" films were both undervalued for their quality. The first one had an excellent examination of the role of vigilantism, justice, and vengeance and how that actually evolved into a mature understanding what crime-fighting actually is (especially how it tied into Peter's own personal vendetta against the man who killed Uncle Ben).

The second film I thought was a terrific examination of the roles of hope vs. hopelessness, nihilism, trust, and community. I also thought that everyone had a great performance in these films.

So far, Andrew Garfield is my favorite Peter Parker AND Spider-man on screen, and I am so glad that SONY decided to got ahead and take a chance on the risky material of these two films.

I'm looking forward to Tom Holland and Spider-man: Homecoming in the future.  30 Minutes or Less: ""The Social Network""    My review of ""Doom"" (2016)...    ELI5: why isn't solar power more utilized in the United States?  [removed]  ""True Romance"" - The movie where Gary Oldman plays the role of a Rastafarian pimp and has one of the best scenes in an already amazing film    My review of ""The Nice Guys"" - a terrific return to the crime genre for Shane Black    A fun parody of ""Shenmue"" in ""Sleeping Dogs""    What's a bad game that you'd like see remade?  Not every video game can be the chart-topping critic-loved game of the year, and sometimes their execution is just totally off, although at their core lies a beating heart of interesting ideas.

What's a game that you liked in theory, but in practice, was a messy pile of either mediocrity or downright bad quality and would love to see a studio remake it?

For me, while the Kane and Lynch series is tempting, I gotta go with ""Eat Lead: the Return of Matt Hazard"". A few moment of particularly engaging brilliance here and there along with some good music and solid voice work makes me sad that the game we ended up getting was a little less of the ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" of video games, and turned out more like ""Cool World"".

What is your 'redemption game' you'd like to see be made?  What's the most 90's phrase you can think of?  [removed]  Quantum Break is one of my contenders for Game of the Year  I love time traveling stories. I love time traveling narratives that actually work with the genre for tension building, expectations, mystery, wonder, and character development. Quantum Break has that by the boat load. The actual question of whether or not time traveling itself could ever be free of a 'closed-loop' is something I found intoxicating in the minute discussions of predestination and free will. 

This game is all about focusing on using the mechanics, presentation, and even the audio design for the sake of the narrative. A great cast of characters with damn good writing and motivations only cement the painful contemplations of what time travel and ""the end of time"" mean for each and every single one of them.

The very fact that you can influence the story arc in particularly meaningful ways for the world and characters is something absolutely fantastic and MUST be commended for the hard working people at Remedy. 

The cast is a wonderfully diverse and strongly acted group of characters who really make the ensemble dynamic work. Shawn Ashmore, Courtney Hope, Aidan Gillen, Dominic Monaghan, Lance Reddick, and everyone in the production is fantastic and memorable. 

As a narrative guy, I applaud Remedy for making a game that really pushes great narrative storytelling in video games, and wanted to express that feeling  Do you consider ground zeros and the phantom pain to be one game?  For me, I think metal gear solid five is a hell of a lot better once you taking to the idea that ground zeroes and the phantom pain are all one game just separated into two different parts.

I really think that Kojima productions could've even naturally added to the game by reusing assets from ground zeroes like camp zero.

It also changes how you see Boss by contrast to venom seeing how much of an overall darker character the OG boss is where ""silencing people"" out of inconvenience is totally acceptable to him in Ground Zeroes with Venom being far more action oriented and forgiving to others. A more ""optimistic"" version of Big Boss.

I love audio logs that are well made in games like BioShock or Dead Space. I was wondering if anyone here happens to know a youtube video or a website where one could listen to all of the audio logs in the game? Thanks for taking the time to write back.  What do you think the overall idea of Metal Gear Solid is?  The MGS universe is many things: inventive, imaginative, political, philosophical, playful, downright bonkers, etc.

If there is a central overall theme or idea that encompasses the entire saga (or at least MGS1 and later) what do you think it is?  Quantum Break is one Hell of a time travel narrative  I think it might be one of the only time travel stories of recent memory that's entirely a closed loop narrative, but doesn't make the ""inevitability"" the only central component, and relies more on the mystery of what the characters discover.

Remedy knocked it out of the park with this game :-)  Would you be angry if they put in a ""easy mode"" for Dark Souls?  For future ""Souls"" games (including the upcoming Dark Souls 3), how would you feel if they put in a ""easy mode"" for players who don't have the ability/time/patience to master game mechanics?

For myself, I wouldn't see the harm in doing so (especially since it would be a good ""gateway difficulty"" for new players to enjoy the experience and have the chance to become addicted to the gameplay, but I'd like to hear your opinions on the subject.  How would you categorize Dark Souls?  What ""kind"" of game, or genre, do you think Dark souls belongs to?  Have you tried Lord of the Fallen yet? Impressions?  Hey everyone. I downloaded the Xbox monthly Gold free game which was Lords of the Fallen. It's clearly inspired by the overall style and world design (general layout and design, etc. rather than visuals. I would say it's more similar looking to Darksiders 1 and 2) as well as some gameplay elements.

For those of you who are ""From Software"" fans, did you play this game, and, if so, did you enjoy it?   There are two types of futures....

I know Halo 5 is a divisive game. I really like it, but even I got to admit that the story wasn't as good as Halo 4's narrative, in my humble opinion. Haruspis is a writer who wrote a lengthy analysis of why Halo 4's narrative was so spectacular when analyzing tropes, motifs, themes, characters, lore, and overall storytelling (opinions I agree with); he also analyzes media and other content concerning the Halo universe and was excited to review Halo 5, and was personally crushed with the end result.

Overall, I agree with him that while there is a number of good things to occur with the story of Halo 5 (Osiris team, seeing more of the universe, and actually bringing civiliazations and civilians to the forefront with the non-combat levels) and like a few things he did not mention (that being the writing of the Warden, Roland getting more say in the conversation, the interesting story hook of the AIs rising up, the narrative bookend of Halsey emotionally reuniting with Chief, etc), however, I do admit that there are a good deal of problems which include HOW 343 set up the story (not primarily associated with the marketing) and other issues. 

I suggest you check it out, and I would to hear your impressions on how you felt where the game succeeded, failed, or had mixed results. Of course, these articles will be primarily focused on the story aspects of the game, so gameplay elements would probably be saved for another time.

...  There should be websites that translates foreign songs into different languages, but also into a matching rhyming scheme  I can't tell you how many times I've listened to a foreign language song, loving the melody, but being disappointed that, when looking at it in English, the rhyming translations impede the 'feeling' of the song.  Would anyone else be as interested in I am if they made a Halo RPG?  Given how much universe, lore, and character building 343 Industries has going on with games, comics, novels, etc. would anybody as interested as I would be if they decided to make a Halo RPG?

Maybe take the role of an Oni operative going from planet to planet dealing with rebel factions, human/Elite relations, stopping Kig-yar scavenger parties, discovering Forerunner tech, etc.

I was listening to someone talking about how Daredevil's origin with Stick is different since in the comics he left because Matt killed out of revenge rather than because he was getting emotionally attached to him.

Did Daredevil happen to kill anyone in the show? 

Post-Edit: Gotcha, Nobu's on the ""debatable"" side of the issue and the mobster he pushed into the dumpster, but nothing really definitive in terms of his morality of whether or not he allows himself to kill.  What did the one Crab say to another greedy Crab that was eating all of the mussels?  Stop being so shellfish.  What property do you want see be adapted into a game?  I ask this to you lovely Reddit users out there:

A) Which property do you want to see adapted (or readapted), and why?

B) Which developer do want handling the game, and for what particular reason?

For myself, I would love to see TellTale adapt the cult-classic series Firefly (or maybe Serenity since FOX won't let go of the name and are just sitting on it like a Dragon on his gold hoard). The gray morality, great dialog, and classic characters would make for a thrilling romp.

...  Brian Reed gets way too much hate  Just completing Halo 5 again, and while I understand the disappointment in not having as amazing of a script as Halo 4, I think Brian Reed has made huge improvements as a writer since Spartan Ops and delivered a good story (thought a little light on character arcs and themes). However, the way people are talking about him on the Halo threads, one might think he enjoys destroying family tombstones for fun.

I've only experienced his work through the Halo games, and while he's not my favorite writer, he's certainly not the worst one possible to take the reigns for this entry, and Halo 5 was (mostly) well-executed, including interactions between characters, and really is more rewarding with repeated viewings.

I can respect someone having problems with story, or with how too damn subtle implications are made in the narrative, but I just think that the hatred thrown against this guy is ridiculous.  [Halo 5 Spoilers] Questions I have about Halo 5's story  Hey all. I really liked Halo 5's story, but I was wondering if someone wouldn't mind filling in some details that I may have missed in the game, and with some of the surrounding media.

* Why are the Prometheans attacking the Covenant and humans? 

* Why didn't Cortana just warn populated colonies to leave so that she could raise the Guardians with no casualties?

* Is Chief aware of the smear campaign ONI did against him? 

* How did Chief find out where the Guardian was?

Thanks for taking the time to read and respond.  There is a surprisingly larger amount of character development when you listen to your squad mates.  I didn't realize how much great bits of characterization you can get if you wait maybe 15-20 seconds to hear the squad chat with one another. I just wanted to share this in case that others were like me were looking for lore or character-building outside of cutscenes, talking with NPCs, or intel items.  Way too subtle storytelling in Halo 5.  A lot of the comments about Halo 5's story either making large leaps or not explaining story I feel comes down to the fact that a lot of information is conveyed by implication that the player only starts to notice when they're replaying the game several times.

For instance, when Master Chief talks about Cortana on Meridian, it's the UNSC's response which causes him to question them. After his report, the UNSC officer tells him that another team is already being dispatched to the mission. The implication here is that they knew Cortana was on Meridian (in some form or another as they don't question his discovery), and that they've already chosen another team as the UNSC or ONI don't trust Blue Team, meaning that plan had been in the works for a while.

Likewise, when Halsey is finally back aboard the Infinity (although she doesn't seem to have much feelings towards the UNSC being responsible for the loss of her arm, nor does anyone seem interested in the other Janus key), her reference to her being in constant communication including what she said before taking her away from Osiris (""What has she done? How far has it already gone?"") is a subtle implication that she's been talking about Cortana to the UNSC for some time.

The story is there, however, the big problem is that, unlike a book that can take time to analyze instantaneous thoughts of characters, these styles of custscenes can't offer up glimpses of what our protagonists are thinking or how their information immediately relates to the story without a really heavy-handed ""story translator"" character to either explain things or have things explained to.

While I didn't think Halo 5 was as well written as brilliantly as Halo 4 (although Brian Reed did a good job and has come a long way from Spartan Ops), I still think it's a good yarn that just takes one pass too many to really understand what's going on. 

Also, side-question out of curiosity. Did anyone happen to catch why Cortana was activating all of the Guardians immediately without giving much warning to the colonies?

Post-edit: I have no collected and listened to all of the game's audio logs, so the answers to some of my questions may be there.  Would you recommend Dark Souls 2: SOTFS?  Hey everyone.

I completed Dark Souls a while back and I was thinking about picking up the new Dark Souls remastering for the new generation of games.

While I liked the first Dark Souls, I wasn't over the moon about it. For those who have played DS2, is it worth the purchase? If it's not better than the original game, I probably won't pick it up and while there are lots of reviewers out there who've analyzed this game, I tend to agree with a lot of opinions in this subreddit.  What video game world would you like to see a return to?  Seeing the fanfare and celebration of Oddworld: Abe's Odyssey being released free this week, I began to wonder which universe I would love to see a return to, personally.

For me, I would have to either go with the world of Crimson Skies: High Road to Revenge (a 'diesel-punk' setting where the U.S. fractured after WW1) or Jade Empire (a terrific mash-up of far Eastern cultures, lore, and traditions). Both are universes that have so much potential for storytelling and with great presentations.

I assume that the little song they sing was used in lieu of the most common birthday song (since those jack-holes at Warner/Chappell Music decided to trademark it, even though it was in the public domain). 

Has Konami trademarked that particular ""Happy Birthday"" song? It's the one time I've heard a 'replacement Happy Birthday song' that was actually just as simple and catchy as the original.

I absolutely fucking hate CinemaSins as either comedy or film criticism      Cowboy Bebop. I'd argue with that show and Trigun (another short run series) it changed the way Americans saw anime and helped launch Adult Swim as a mainstay of television.       Fantastic news. Season 4 was different but still great. If you didn't enjoy season 4, I highly recommend multiple rewatches. It all works better when given another look.

I did, but I still thought that it didn't reach the stratospheric heights of the original seasons. A combination of the family members lack of interaction, the writing not being as sharp, the editing allowing for too many jokes that probably should have been cut (Michael and George-Michael one-upping each other's lie comes to mind), and character changes that I consider to be mistakes (mostly in them making Michael a REALLY unlikable jerk).

Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the season (and if you love it, more power to you). I just didn't think it's close to being as good as the original run.     Yeah. I felt like the showrunners should have played TellTale's adaptation of ""The Walking Dead"" or watch ""Stranger Things"" to understand how to write well-written kid characters in horror situations, but I do genuinely enjoy The Strain.     * Samurai Jack - Tartakovsky proves he's a master visual storyteller once more with Jack's final season against Aku.

Haha. But you get so wrapped up in it, you can't help but love it. Atlantis, I think, is a little darker than SG-1, and it opens up new realms since the characters are in another galaxy.

From what I understand, a lot of the best zoology programs that have to do with marine biology are on the east coast. But according to the head of our department, MSU's zoology program is one of the strongest off the east coast. Personally, I love it here, but obviously I'm biased.

Basically, make sure to do your research based on what you want to go into and what research professors at your future school are involved in so maybe you can work in one of their labs.

I foster kittens for our local humane society, so far up to 36, and I'm pretty sure there isn't much I haven't seen now. You think two's bad? Try having six at once. haha. I don't know if this will help, but this is my advice.

1. It's kind of normal for kittens to not know how they clean themselves. I would suggest using some wet wipes on her butt, or, wash it with soap and water. Usually when I do this to a kitten, they freak out because they're wet and proceed to groom themselves for like half an hour. You said she claws at everything... Wouldn't you if someone was holding you up trying to put things near your girly parts??  Try holding her by the scruff - I promise this doesn't hurt them, the mom-cats do it with their teeth; it's an area with limited nerves and it releases endorphins, it will instantly calm her.  Also, try a different flavor wet food. Maybe don't give them wet food for a day, eventually they'll eat the dry food, then you can proceed to give them wet food more sporadically, or once a day.

2. The scratching is completely normal, in fact, I'd probably say expected for a kitten. You can try to trim her claws, or when you take her to the vet, have them do it since you haven't owned cats before. Really, the hardest part is getting them to stay still and as long as you trim a few millimeters from the tip, you should be fine... but, if you're not comfortable doing this, by all means, don't. A scratching post, as I saw someone posted, would also be a good idea. The biting is normal too, especially if they're teething, they want to chew on everything.

3. The rough playing happens with all kittens - it's how they learn their normal cat behaviors - the stalking, chasing, all that. Boys are usually rougher than girls. There's no reason for him to seriously hurt her, honestly, i know it looks bad but it's just what they do. Also, the grooming is normal too :] and of course, cute.

4. I literally just had two fosters, a stray kitten that was paired with another unrelated kitten. So... while they're young, they may have still not wanted to interact with people as stray cats. But also because they're young, you can kind of teach them some things. This will take time. What I'll do sometimes is when a kitten is sleeping, take it and put it in your lap - generally they'll go right back to sleep, cuddle, purr, all that good stuff. You can go looking for their little happy spots - some cats like being scratched under the neck, some of them like their scruff massaged - something that makes them purr. Also, they won't be too lovey if they're in a playful mood, usually it's when they get tired. It'll just take some time, some getting used to for them. They'll figure it out. 

Just love them with all you've got. :]     does it bother anyone else that he wears his pants like urkel without even a shirt tucked into it?     especially when it's a middle school student! my god.      kitty mcslutmeow.     if only the human population could still be controlled by natural selection...     I think it depends on the girl; but, that said, it does not take me 30 minutes or anywhere close. If you do your foreplay right, it can happen pretty quickly. For me, clitoral stimulation is key; as is for most girls. That can be affected by the position and whatnot. But like it's been said, communication, communication, communication! If it feels good she should be telling you. If she doesn't want you to stop, goddamnit, don't stop!     that has got to be the sweetest thing i've ever seen. he certainly was a lucky man and clearly lived a great life. :]     I'm a zoology major at Michigan State and, really, I've learned so much. Animals are really my passion; I'm not looking to go to vet school, but moreso in something that's conservation-focused. Be prepared for a lot of science-related classes, I know that sounds obvious, but some people go into shell shock. If you don't like biology, I wouldn't recommend it, of course. Here, we have a lot of concentrations you can go into, like neurology, animal behavior, zoo and aquarium science, etc. I graduate this year so I can't tell you about the pay haha, but check out that site from below!

Reddit, one of my friends has been diagnosed with anorexia. I need your advice on how I can help.  A little background story: This is an old coworker of mine, and for as long as I've known her, she's always been petite (I'm a size 4 and she's smaller than I am), but toned and a little curvy. 


When I saw her for the first time in 6+ months, she is just skin and bones; blamed it on working out too much. Apparently, her heart rate is down to 40 beats per minute when she's awake. Her mom has arranged for her to see a therapist and a nutritionist, but apparently, she's not cooperating so much mentally.


All of her friends won't talk to her or hang out with her because of this, and she told a mutual friend of ours about it, asking her to help her get better. She doesn't know I know, so I can't really get further information, but our friend is stressing out big time about helping her. Obviously, to us the solution seems simple, but I know our thought processes are so different from hers right now. What can we do?     so, my dad only has one eye due to some accident with another kid and a stick when he was little (i never felt comfortable asking for details). he has a fake eye now, and someone probably already asked this, but why will you have to wear an eyepatch? is it due to the infection (which i believe my dad didn't have, since it was removed right away)?     that looks awkwardly like my psy395 professor...     his excuse was lack of opposable thumbs. can't believe i fell for it.      solution: don't get her pregnant.     that's good to hear. and thank you, it means a lot!     thank you so much for sharing this. it's exactly what i was hoping for when i posted it. i hope you're doing well yourself. :]     i know last semester, she was unbelievably stressed out and spent hours upon hours at the gym per day. it would take a trail of french fries to even get me to step foot into a gym, so i have no idea how she does. the thing is, our mutual friend is closer with her than i am, yet we have no idea what it is she's dealing with that is causing this reaction. :[     i hear you. my kryptonite is mcdonald's french fries.       at vs, we're told that it's 75% of women wearing the wrong bra size! even if they're wearing their sister size, it might not be as good of a fit.     when you buy a new bra, you want it to fit comfortably on the loosest hook because it'll stretch out as you wear it; that way you'll have the room to tighten your band and still get the same support! that's why they put you in a 34 :]     It's called a sister size. So, say a 34C fits well in the cup, but the band is too big. You go down in the band and up in the cup = 32D which is essentially the same cup size, just 2 inches smaller in the band. Now, if a 34C fit in the cup, but was too tight around, and you go up in the band size, you go down in cup, making 36B an equivalent.     i just googled vast amounts of pictures of katy just to look at her boobs. as a victoria's secret employee, i'm pretty sure they're bigger than that; a 32D is only equivalent to a 34C (don't be fooled by the letters!).     as a bulgarian, this makes me very proud. haha   i fully expect to get killed in my sleep for this.

     Can anybody tell me what evidence this entire Russia thing is based on?  Not what you think or circumstantial rumors, where is any evidence at all.   Documents, video, audio, hack.....Anything?  What was the smoking gun to start all of this?  Not a notion, a fact

Why did people want Comey fired when he hurt Hillary, but now he is fired and those same people are complaining he is fired?     People like you make things suck in the military. The sailor wants some help and turned to us.  Its a bit stupid to assume the sailor did not try to look things up, or is in a position that references are not handy, or even hearing some scuttlebutt. MeatShit really fits, I'm betting your a Chief.  How about your lazy ass helping somebody?     I would like to add that when struck the aircraft becomes the same potential in energy as the lightning. (obviously)  however, there is no difference in potential for the flow of energy.   
Birds are OK on a wire because there is no difference in potential (path for electricity.)  If the bird was on a wire had one long leg and touched the ground it would be fried because the electricity has a path to flow.  The same for an aircraft, but if the aircraft was dragging a really long wire on the ground, the electricity from the lightning would flow through the plane and electrocute everyone and everything.

One more - those guys working up on the high voltage wires.   They can hang on the wire all day and the have the same potential as the wire, if they were to reach out and touch the tower they would get electrocuted.  Electricity would have a path to ground through the worker.

I have been living with my girlfriend for a few months which was a good thing because I realized even though she was hot, she was crazy..not rational at all.

Im in the military and we are going out over the weekend for exercises. The Thursday night before I leave, I decide to break the news to her that I think it would be best if she moved out while I was gone. She agrees - great its mutual. I thought it was good plan; I would not have to carry anything or go through the drama. Friday morning Im out the door with a good times goodbye kiss and things are going great. When I get back; I will have the entire place to myself.

A little bit into the deployment the boys ask me what was going on with the girlfriend. I told them the story and one of the fellows points out more than likely she will trash the place. I was pissed and started to worry the entire time we were away. Of course, I caught all kinds of crap form everybody the entire time regarding my calculated error. Things really sucked, there was nothing I could do but wait it out.

Along comes Monday night  the night of reckoningtime to go home and see how bad things are. I open the door an inch at a time and could not believe my eyes. This was the cleanest I had ever seen the place. Im thinking, what the heck is going on? Sure enough all her stuff is gone and the place looks great! No notes, and no sign that she ever existed. Heavenly!

The next morning the fellows are waiting with bated breath to find out how bad I was suffering because of my decision. Broke their hearts when I told them what had happened. They were disappointed; some couldnt believe it and figured something had to be up.

Fast forward a few weeks, my mail comes to my unit address so I can receive it when I am away. I get a big manila envelope from AT T. I open the envelope and it is a bill for thousands of dollars! I start looking at the charges (This is a good time to tell you that her brother was in the Navy in Japan). I think I remember putting the phone back on the receiver when I returned. Well, she got me. Time and Temperature recording in Japan! From the day I left until the time I got home and hung up. You could see the minute charges for the overseas calls  a few pages of 45 cents, 75 cents, over a dollar etc. 4 days straight. You get the picture. (For those of you that are not old enough to remember we paid by the minute in the 90s for our long distance calls.) I have to give it to her well played, well played indeed.

As far as the bill I had to payThe phone company was pretty cool about it. They averaged that bill with the last 12 months so it was a manageable punishment for messing around with crazy. Most of the pain came from the guys at work, never lived it down until I transferred. Young and dumb good times!

From me to all of you.  Enjoy!     In my opinion the health benefits of not drinking out weigh the garbage food you are eating.   Things will settle down, give it time.  Your body has no idea what is going on.  Sooner or later you will be more aware of the food you are eating and harness the cravings.   Hang in there!  This is probably the best gift you have ever given yourself.     Thank you  Why don't we hear about people dying of cancer in the past, but cancer takes so many lives now?  Is cancer something that has taking  hold of us in the past few centuries because of our health choices?

Wildlife population and hunting during the great depression.  My great grandmother spoke of lard sandwiches and soup lines during the great depression. When I think about what I would have done during the great depression to feed my family, I immediately think I would go hunting.  Is there any evidence that the population of wildlife decreased or the sale of hunting guns increased due to families hunting to survive.  

Edit - In the United States  ELI5:What makes a music conductor renowned, good or bad?  From what I can tell they wave their hands around, keeping tempo and telling people when to start and stop playing.   The way I see it is they are telling the musicians to do what is written on the paper and they get all the cheers.
So what makes a conductor good or the best?  How would I know if a conductor made an error?   Have conductors ever been blamed for music not sounding good.

     A Zippo lighter in the front and a bandanna in the back     A Amish friend explained it to me like this....To paraphrase - We all agree that there are some evil/bad things on TV that may pull you away from Gods teachings and lead you to sin.  Some might say, well turn off the TV.  However we believe (Amish) that we should rid our lives of anything that may lead us to sin.  
On another note, here in PA a law was passed that milk must be refrigerated once it leaves the cow...(What to do??)  install generators!  Since we have generators, we have vacuum off the engine.  They now have sewing machines that work off the vacuum of the engines.  Hand sewn quilt anyone?

     I feel like I just read all about myself a year ago.  You are a mirror image of what I was.  Here is the secret........Quit drinking.  It is not what you want to hear and that's ok - nobody wants to hear the truth.  
Now if you think by my saying ""Quit drinking"" you will stop - you are wrong - it doesn't work that way.  (I would be rich)  You are going to have to really hit rock bottom or get a big kick in the butt or hopefully you can just make up your mind to stop before you really screw up your life.   The facts remain, we can't do it for you and you are hurting yourself.   When you care enough about yourself and the people around you, you will quit drinking on your own.  Your not special, there is nothing different in you that you can keep going and living like you are - we have all tried and said ""no not me""  and ""I can just cut back""  Bullshit.  You wont cut back and you cant make deals with your drinking.
So there is the answer to your problems. Quit drinking.   Stop bargaining with yourself or bargaining with the booze ""oh just one more day""  because you are lying to yourself and the booze will always laugh at you.

Whenever anything hits your car you must say it flew off a truck etc...and hit your car never touching the the road.  (had to pull over and could not catch up to the truck)
If it falls of a truck bounces off the road right in front of you it is a road hazard because it touched the road. 

Many years ago I insured logging trucks in the Carolina's.   We would record the call and if the caller said a piece of wood came off the truck, hit the road and bounced damaging there car we would tell them to take a walk.  When we explained and they changed  their account of the story..... we had the recording.

Word of advice....Stay clear of logging trucks, they are paid by the load.  The faster they go the faster they make money.  What is one thing a Muslim would like to ask a Christian?

Many people dont realize that the weight of the chain is what keeps a ship in place not the anchor.  The anchor is to get the chain to the ocean floor.  The links are 100  200 pounds each.   The ship I was on, the anchor weighed about 3000 pounds.
The drum that is spinning is held in place by a friction brake (picture old drum brakes on a car) As a wheel is turned by the operator the friction on the drum is increased or decreased.   From what I see here the operator let the momentum of the entire thing get away from him and the brake material became too hot started smoking and lost all effectiveness. In the very beginning, if you look very closely between the spinning wheel and the rope you can see a few seconds of man turning the wheel frantically.  That smoke you see is the friction pad burning up.  I would estimate the length of the brake pad being about half the circumference of the wheel and about 6 inches wide.  The very end of the chain was connected to the ship down inside the locker.  The eye protection is on because sailors have a habit of throwing crap down the whole with the chain, usually soda cans come flying out.
I have no doubts they dragged for the chain and recovered the entire thing. 

Edit - also at the end you can see the chain is painted yellow and then painted red to warn the operator the end is near.

 Sounds like a tough one, maybe leave good enough alone.  Keep it on the sunny side, your wife has smooth legs!     Just saying how it worked in the old school.  T-Shirts were soaked and sweat ran down into our pants, but we looked good!   This is a big thing at boot camp when you are a drill instructor- recruits are sweating in the hot sun and you look you just stepped out of air-conditioning, actually you were soaked and miserable.   Perception!     I was thinking the same thing.  Tax money paying for the death of Indians just sucks.  I do not think that the times that these atrocities happened is an excuse.  These were human beings.  
Your right, it should be acknowledged.
The only issue I would have with acknowledging what happened is the cost of all the claims people will put against the government for something that happened 100 years ago.  Suddenly everyone would have some American Indian in them,,,,Elizabeth Warren syndrome.

     It is a little bit odd in the beginning - remember there is no reason to wear them stretched real tight.   Clip them to the front of your shirt, I always lined it up with the pleats or the center of the breast pocket  - then the other end to the side of you sock.   If you put the front clips to the front of your socks they will slide off your knee caps when you walk.
Really becomes second nature after a few days and just part of getting dressed.  
Another thing we did in the military is line up the front of the shirt opening with the edge of the belt buckle with the zipper.  Its called a ""gig line""   Here is a reference: http://gallogrotte.tumblr.com/post/22463691050/gentlemen-check-your-gig-line-what-is-it-where

Edit: added link     Its a voltage selector.   I have seen something similar on old x-ray machines.   The operator selects the power with a control knob, the signal is sent to a motor which turns a gear.  The gear turns the gear you have on your voltage selector to ""dial in"" the voltage needed by swinging the arm to a particular place along the brass contacts. Each set of brass contacts is a certain voltage.   X ray machines use kilovolts, so this voltage selector was inside a protective box. Maintenance included cleaning off those brass contacts about once a year or when the operator complained that the x-ray was not shooting at particular settings and cleaning off the connections on the arm that swings around the contacts.  I would put this in the late 50s to late 60s.  Now we use computers to select which relays will connect to a voltage divider when the x-ray button is pushed.
As a caveat:  I have seen them in x-ray machines, perhaps they may have been used for industrial applications where selecting high voltages is required.  Welding or motor speed controller?  Just a good safe way to choose the high voltages needed.
     If I may speak for others like myself, the next President (arguably) will name up to four supreme court justices. These justice picks are important for the future of our country depending on which way you swing - conservative or liberal.  Presidents choose Supreme Court nominees on the basis of several criteria including nominees perceived ideological position, rewarding political allies, appealing to voters, and avoiding confirmation battles in the Senate. Trump would most likely nominate a Justices whom are more in line with conservative values.   Clinton would most likely nominate a Justices whom are more in line with liberal values.  
Some critical issues which may arise for decisions in Supreme Court cases are abortion rights, immigration, affirmative action, death penalty, stem cell research, energy, euthanasia   physician-assisted suicide, global warming/climate change, guns, healthcare, same sex marriage, welfare.  
It is important to remember  What the Supreme Court says  goes.   
VERY IMPORTANT - The supreme court justices are appointed for life.  
If Clinton or Trump can stack four out of the nine Justices to rule cases toward their partys views, then the Supreme court decisions are more likely going to lean toward those views.  
So, as your question asks why are some of us ""obsessed""   Well, I want the law of the land which the Supreme Court decides to go toward my views regarding things like immigration, guns, healthcare, etc.  This is a once in my lifetime chance to get up to four votes on the Supreme Court which will lean the country toward my beliefs and determine the direction of the country for many years. (liberal or conservative).  Once Clinton or Trump are out of office and probably until the day I die, the Supreme Court justices will be deciding cases toward or away from my views and beliefs.

We primarily instituted tags in season 1 so as to separate spoilers from the book, but now that season 1 basically covered the book, the rule no longer feels necessary.

Many users encountered troubles with the tagging system, and we feel the frustration the system caused submitters outweighed the benefit some users gained from being able to browse with specific spoiler scopes.

All we ask now is that you abstain from putting spoilers in the title. You should now expect spoilers up to the latest aired episode in any links or comments posted here, unless the title specifically says otherwise (such as a user with a season 1 question, or an official episode discussion).

Also keep in mind that episode previews and information from IMDB (such as the number of episodes a character appears in) is considered to be a spoiler and should be tagged appropriately.

A local earthquake station gets an anonymous tip...  
One day a local scientist named Steve was sent a mysterious email. The email read:

Steve I know who you are, and where you live. My name must remain anonymous, so as of now you may refer to me as ""Somebody"". Steve I contact you because my independent studies have discovered a massive earthquake heading your way. You, your research center, your city, and half of your State are in for the mother of all earthquakes. My advanced Richter scale is reading an earthquake with a magnitude of 13! That's an extremely dangerous magnitude as you should know, your state will literally vibrate, do the wave, roll itself out, in other words you will die if you don't act now. You have exactly 25 hours to evacuate everyone and take any important instruments or research devices that cannot be lost or replaced, to safety. By my calculations you'll pick up the oncoming earthquake in 4 hours, but if every city and town doesn't start evacuating in 8 hours, it may be too late to save everyone.

Steve panicked, he didn't want to risk anything so he packed all of his important instruments first into a van and pulled out his laptop. He needed to make sure that this was a confirmed earthquake and not some hoax. So he did, he waited the four hours and sure enough it was real. He quickly speed dialed the mayor, who had always been a good friend of his.

""Steve, you caught me at a rough time what do you need?""

""Mayor you need to evacuate half of the state, we're all in danger!""

""Woah! Woah! Steve, are you okay? What's going on?""

""Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me"".  I'm not racist...  I'm sexist  I got $20 from a blind homeless man on the street today!

I got my posters, months ago, yours must be messed up.     Just complain to Club Nintendo, if they mess up on items, they repay you back in large ways, I got two more poster kits for their mess up on my first. If anything they can tell you the status.  I animated the FNAF 4 Plot meme       because making themselves seem like they're the better and more powerful dealer with a bigger bargin, makes them look like first priority. In other words, a small item for a big item is easy to take advantage of.     Get Punch Out, it's meant to be played on wii controllers and is worth it (I bought it did not use my reward to redeem)     well duh, you were trading a mewtwo code, who would pay 10-20 dollars worth for a $4 code.     lol he's right      3 months for my poster kit, 4 days for my other two poster kits     4D     Not sure, you'd have to give me the rep of the middle man/mod, considering how your account seems like it was just made.     lol did you say free and good hahaha      If it doesn't come, definitely complain to club nintendo, if they think they mess up or do, they'll send you 2 more as a bonus, now I have 3 poster sets :D  Just Another Walk Test       Punch Out in my opinion is the best game only because it actually uses the wii controllers on how they were made to be used.

This game is so successful, it''s making a 3ds title, because it doesn't really convince you to buy into scams.

Considering how this isn't a trading thread and you have no karma, you are most likely a scammer, I suggest you delete this post, if you actually are not a scammer I do have a leftover Ryu/Map 3ds code available for trade.

Get Punch-Out much unless you already own it.     not more likely to receive but to lose, I say this considering how the US physical items have only disappeared from the Club Nintendo, if you can get the second poster set worth everything I spent for it(the shulk art is so good).     Animal Crossings is ok, I used my reward to get Super Mario Galaxy 2. If you can get Punch Out Wii Virtual Console     don't you mean trading? Giving is a bit confusing to type.

He never killed anybody, but he shot four 5th graders and one teacher, all in different body parts; in the knee, shoulder, and arm.""

I asked him ""How's this the worst school shooting you've ever seen? I'm pretty sure there's been much more bloodshed and deaths in other shootings.""

""No I literally mean this was the worst school shooting. The kid had like four rounds of ammo and missed almost every shot, with no kills.""   What did the cow say to the other cow?

  You each will be granted ONE wish.  Three explorers find a magical wishmaker who is willing to grant the explorers one wish for the greatest desires.

The first explorer walks up and says,""I wish for a time machine, so I can go to the future and live in a more advanced world."" The wishmaker grants the wish and sends the explorer to the year 3016 where it probably got better.

The second explorer says,""I wish for a soulmate who will love me for the rest of my life."" The wish is granted and the explorer goes to a church to be wedded with the love of his life.""

Finally the third explorer, contemplates then says, ""I wish to have a glock 43 pistol."" Confused with a wish so small, the wishmaker grants it and gives the explorer his gun. The explorer points the gun at the wishmaker and yells, ""Give me more wishes or else!""

The PC Genie  Three travelers stumble upon a magically genie willing to grant them each one wish, but are warned there may be a catch if they don't wish carefully.

The first traveler, a middle-aged man walks up to the genie and says, ""I wish for a beautiful wife who would love me for eternity."" The man's wish is granted and a woman appears, the man runs off with his wish and starts making out with his new girlfriend. An hour passes and as the other two travelers think of their wishes, the man returns in an angrily fashion.

""WHAT GIVES, WHY'D YOU RUIN A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN YOU TWISTED FUCK?!?!""

""What's wrong?"" replies the second traveler.

""My girlfriend, is actually a transgender boyfriend!""

The genie responds with a disappointed look, ""look bro, you could've been more specific on your wish, it's 2016 and anyone can identify as a woman.""

Using this new knowledge of wishes; the second traveler, a young woman in her 30s, asks for a white, strong, republican male, with the most beautiful glare. She's given a Jar of Mayonaise, and stares at the genie in confusion. ""Pretty sure Mayonaise isn't a gender"".

""Yeah but Tumblr says otherwise,"" replied the genie.

The last traveler, a young-man in his 20s, thinks carefully. He walks up to the genie and says, ""I wish for a tall beautiful woman, she has to be born as 100% female, has to find me extremely attractive, and is not a jar of mayonaise. I wish to find her in my bed, waiting to make love to me tonight"".

The next day and the traveler angrily runs up to the genie and screams at him. The two travelers ask the genie what the ",0

Sponsorship hypothesis  So with 24 events in the bag and the payout averaging $161,145 (approximately 6k a fighter). This year's pay out will be about $7 million dollars this year. that leaves me believing that each year we will see a slight increase in the pay out to fighters kind of build it up year after year which would show the fighters that over the long run they will make more and more.

If they build 2015/2016 7 mill 2016/2017 8.5 mill 2017/2018 10 mill 2018/2019 12 mill 2019/2020 14 mill 2020/2021 16 mill

VPN for fight pass  [removed]  (rant)fighters pay the journey of robbie lawler and the problem with aljamian sterling  this is the fighter pay story of ufc champ robbie lawler and the reason why fighters like aljamian sterling wont get what they ask for just by making noise.
-first 18 fights made 1k-20k a fight progressive build 

his elite xc days 30k-45k 

strikeforce he made 80k average with the lowest being 65k and highest 150k

his second stint in the ufc he made 105k which build up thru wins to his last title defense he made 500k 

for those who say fighters dont make enough i conclude that they havent been fighting long enough after 16 years in combat sports robbie lawler paid his dues and it paid off after 6 years of being a pro.

aljamian sterling has been fight as a pro for 4 years  and has only fought in the ufc 4 times 

he started out as 8k/8k  and progressed to 14k/14k at what seems the normal build up rate of ufc fighters on a win streak. the more they win the more they make.  

the ufc wont pay this kid anything more he will get the same progressive contract and once he defeats a champion he can start getting paid the big bucks till then he needs to shut up and pay his dues just like everyone else.

sorry for any errors

     1.Aristarchuswas born in about 310 BC in Ancient Greece. He was the first person to propose that the earth and the other planets orbit the sun. He also said that the stars are much farther away than the planets.

2.Gregor Mendelwas a monk who founded the science of genetics. He was the first person to correctly identify the rules of heredity which determine how traits are passed through generations of living things.

3.but his hypothesis is gaining ground everyday even the national post did an article on his theory. I'm not saying it's 100% at the moment but I'll be watching more information

     Gregor Mendelwas a monk who founded the science of genetics. He was the first person to correctly identify the rules of heredity which determine how traits are passed through generations of living things.     They will all lose their belts this year. Remind me   Fun fact about theories  -The man who thought up plate tectonics was considered a hack till well after he died. 

-The man who said washing your hands would save lives was a crazy 

-The man who said planets orbit the sun wasn't proven right until 2000 years after his death

-The guy who invented genetics 

So as much as you can be for or against Graham and Randell they have an idea and it hasn't been disproving     75% of us do not give a shit cultural appropriation is human trait we see something we like and use it or improve on it.

The New York Times has not viewed a copy of the memo, which is unclassified, but one of Mr. Comeys associates read parts of it to a Times reporter.""

Chess is infinite: there are 400 different positions after each player makes one move apiece. 72,084 positions after each player makes two moves apiece. More than 9 million unique positions from the third move. After the 4th move, more than 288+ billion different positions are possible. Many 40-move games on Level-1 can be achieved than the number of electrons in our universe. There are more game-trees of Chess than the number of galaxies (100+ billion), and more openings, defences, gambits, etc. than the number of quarks in our universe!

  Giving ai rights  Giving artificial intelligence rights to me is absurd idea. We create artificial intelligence to benefit our needs and wants. No more no less you give it a purpose and it fulfills it. I cannot foresee an instance where one day we turn on an AI and it starts talking to us about dreams, painting pictures, setting goals and searching for purpose in life. The only case in which this will happen would be a case of human guidance but in itself would be artificial or false.

The subject keeps getting brought up in this form and I think people are trying to stretch things that we give to living creatures.A dog has rights because it lives it breathes and we didn't add code to make it a dog. A robot no matter how human like you can create it is nothing more than a series of codes and is acting on the set of parameters that we create or itself might add to because it was designed in such a way.


I'm curious to see your Arguments for and against giving rights and why?     Leave it to someone on Reddit to point out the spinning of job creation negativity     Google is your friend

Edit you are making clouds not moving them away from some other place       I meant about the brain damage     Ways to make money as a fighter 
1.fight in the UFC (starting pay is the highest for new fighters by 2-3x other promotions)
2. Sponsorships ( earnings vary by your marketability)
3. Host seminars/ instructor
4.paid training partner
5.own your gym 
6.get paid to be part of a team (team elevation pays there fighters same as whatever gym Hendricks is at)

Making it as a fighter is a hard thing to do you need a few things.

subject3359,"    It's not, only one person gets an assist.     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZpNImkbFQ --- Watch this :)     Different line-up with bigger names, also they only participated in one major.

EDIT: Also, there wasn't a big post about it since he got around $300 max for match fixing, while IBP got thousands of dollars in skins.     Because epsilon wasn't a top tier team or a very well known one, IBP was the 2nd best team in America.     Surrender at the start of a new round instead of the end of another, if the vote passes at the end of a round it sometimes bugs out and won't do anything.     Wasn't involves in cheating, wut? He was match fixing with other members from epsilon.     Do whatever you think feels right. I'm a wrist player, have tried arm for a week once but just couldnt get used to it and it felt horrible. There are still quite a few wrist players in the pro scene (like Hiko, ex6tenz, f0rest sort of i think but not sure). You can be a pro even with your wrist.     Everyone gets better at their own pace, dont worry.     Trust me, you can become a higher rank. I'm yet to be global, but know I can be if I put some work into it. I thought I was stuck in silver forever, was stuck in there for 200 hours (yes I was fucking terrible), then slowly started ranking up and made it to LEM with 950 hours on record (a lot of which are surf and afk as well though). I don't think you've hit your skill ceiling just yet, just believe in yourself.     How to deal with derankers: +left +forward     Many people have an issue with it because it's a ""noob gun""/""cod gun"". I personally still prefer the AK due to me using it for 1000+ hours and only having bought the SG when properly fucking about, but I can see why people would go with the SG. Have to say tho, to play against them can be annoying as fuck. Same goes for the auto, p90 and aug, but it's part of the game so we'll have to deal with it.     The damage is the same as m4a4 now, I may be wrong though. Don't quote me on that.     He get's banned 1 second after throwing the molly because I was standing right ontop of it lol     The lad probably tried to put it up for $351 but accidently ended up putting it up for $3.51 and then a bot bought it.     Elo system only cares about wins, ties, losses and mvps. 

If you top with a lot of mvps against higher ranked/same skilled players, but you lose, you probably wont derank. 

If you top with no mvps against lower ranked players, you may get deranked.

     *Vanishing trick, oops     They did not, they meant to change it, but it ended up not going through in the patch. (even though the buy menu does state it has a lower armour pen than the m4a4) They will keep it how it is now since they think it's balanced.     Glock and p2k on par? Not really lol.

The p2k and usp are on par, one is meant for tapping players the other for sprayers. (both can be used by either type of players but you know what I'm saying.)

Personally, I do way better with the p2k. I do horrendous when I play with the usp.  The famous vanishing by ""Rat""!       38 min and you still didn't beat the map, rip :(     TSM Stickers have been changed, names on autographs are white and so is the logo. Not the background sadly.     I try to get as many toxic Russians banned from competitive as I can :)     Buuuut... You take the karma :(     Yes, there are, but even the pro players have agreed to each other to not use the SG and AUG. The main weapons should be the M4 and AK. (and AWP)     ""i have to get 20 lvls in 10 weeks""

You could've easily been at rank 40 already, even without the bonus exp.

Why do you want the medal on your smurf anyway lol?     Dust2: Tie between nV/TSM, however when NiP plays on D2 they do quite well.

Mirage: I'd say VP, but TSM could take it as well.

Cache: Fnatic

Train: VP

Cobble: de_olofstone, nah jk not sure

Inferno: TSM

Overpass: de_olofpass/TSM/VP




So yeah basically what Blue said too.     Looks pretty dank.     Great video, I really hope valve decides to give first shot accuracy gets a buff.     How come it's repetitive? Sure threads like these were posted for the cologne stickers, they weren't yet for the dreamhack ones though.     What is shadowban and how do other people know if others have one?     Had to test in the name of science :P

And yeah, seems like they don't scratch as well, the name is pretty clear, but it sucks that a bit of the sticker remains.     Only tested this once, the background seems to get fully removed but parts of the side and logo stayed.

EDIT: This was until the very last scrape   Scraped Dreamhack sticker       I stocked up on them, sold 'em the day after for quick and easy profit instead of waiting and it payed off :D 30 euros profit      http://imgur.com/a/HysqT - Yep, here it is     You scraped it more than 7 times, after the 7th it goes invisible.      Oh for real? Didn't know that was patched.

And I guess you could, I personally don't though, would rather just get to a position quickly.     You can't buy multiple smokes unless you've picked one up in the previous round so yeah lol     You can do this smoke while running lol, no need to sit still and jumpthrow it.      Are you fucking retarded? Skip to 0:14 you spaz.     These look dope     Mad respect for getting DMG with such fps, the highest I was able to get with around 30 fps was nova 4 by only spraying. Currently am LEM, my main playstyle is spraying. Tapping isn't really my thing, not good at it whatsoever. The problem really just is your fps, sorry bro.     On AKs stickers look good in nearly any position on most of the skins, not on ones like the fire serpent tho     Well, in my experience it is lol. Everyone knows dust 2, everyone knows the common spots or places where people hide and shit. It's purely about good aim and out awping in my opinion.      Please stop giving this bitch attention, thank you.     I struggle the most with dust 2 to be honest, mainly because it's a pure aim map and I'm personally more about lurking/positioning and game sense.     When he was still decent, rip friberg. We will remember you, my friend.     Nice man     ^ This.

My old laptop used to work fine for multiple months then just gave me shit fps due to it overheating. For me there wasn't anything to do other then get a cooler (which still barely worked). So I just go a pc instead.     Haha all right, too each their own :P It can be a bit of a pain in the arse for your friend though when he wants to queue together and you're practising xD      Maybe it's just that you don't enjoy the feeling of the gun, I mean it may seem weird since it's just in a game, but personally I much prefer the AK over the M4. The M4 also just has better accuracy which may be why flicking is either for you with that.     If you upgrade you have one month to switch back if you want btw.     The laughing though xD     Pala banter lads

Also Semmler is French? Damn, never even knew that.     Just like Notapearing, I just jump straight into games as I get on. I'm one of those really consistent players who doesn't need warmup whatsoever (a bit of surfing is nice but doesn't really help anyway). Got from silver to LEM in a couple months of time just playing when I feel like it instead of forcing myself to do so. Never really been a fan of aim training and stuff like that, spraying I learned myself and just have a feel for it. Getting to global will still be pretty hard tho as the skill gap does indeed get way bigger between LEM/Global     This guy is literally the best caster lol     Wasn't this already posted before?     That is so true lmao. I'm mainly a rifler, but when I watch some of the ""primary awpers"" I just cringe when they miss the easiest shots multiple times in a row. I barely play awp and even I would be able to hit the guy lol.

     You're DMG and you've only gotten one ace before? I'm assuming you're a very passive support player?     You just need to aim at the head with pistols and dont just spray them and instead tap fire lol. It's not that hard if you practise on HS pistol only servers.     1: Howl/Fade preferably with a darkish background (maybe make both to see which I like more? :p)
2: KrayzeeK (Short: KrayZ)

Awesome work by the way 3     For real? 0 derankers? Damn. I have gotten like 4 or 5 groups of derankers in about 60 matches on my alt lol. Most Russians I meet just shout stupid shit and I just have to mute them anyway (most of the time when I get them on my team, they're absolute shit) and personally I don't meet many good smurfs, but you have one every so often.     Bro, D2 is where nearly everyone plays. It's just cancerous as hell, one game you have russians, the other game trolls and then the next game derankers. Or you can just have smurfs/hackers on the other team as well. 

Obviously anyone can rank up to supreme by mainly playing Dust 2, but it comes down to the luck of having a good team/same skilled opponents aswell.     Sir please put the memes down, you may hurt yourself because of all the edginess     Ayy not sure if you do colours too, but either draw a deagle blaze or just the default AK47, that'd be pretty cool. 
     And here I am wanting a knife ;_;

JKJK, I'd actually like a butter knife, that'd be embarrasing as fuck to die to haha.     Check the bottom right at 1:30, the drool tho lol     Either wait the extra couple seconds after the game is finished, or disconnect and don't click on either reconnect/abondon.. It's not hard.     Ohh haha, looks pretty cool though!     Maniac? Forgot about Scream joining? :p     Still pretty good nonetheless     One clutch proves it is still really good? Don't think it does, sorry mate.     Looks alright, rip m4a1-s tho  [Q] When do you guys think the dreamhack stickers will come out?  [removed]     put your shaders on high/very high, that's probably why they seem dark. Or alternatively get SweetFX/turn digital vibrance up in nvidia control panel.     This is valve deathmatch though, not a proper HS server like he was on.     Image doesnt work, GG     For me personally, I mostly play maps like Overpass, Cobble and Train, the ""odd"" ones. I'm also more of a T-sided player, like I'll have a shit CT side getting like 10 kills, then on T-side I just get up to 30.     Oh haha, personally I don't play it a lot but once in a while it's fun. I mainly play de_olofpass nowadays and usually get nice teams.     http://www.hitbox.tv/efragtv/team --- should be on here later today when the stream is over.     Even if you queue alone it shouldn't be too hard as long as you don't play dust 2, that's where the cancerous part of the community plays.     The thing is, it can be very hard to get out of silver for some people due to bad luck. Smurfs on the other team, russians on your own team, derankers, trolls etc. In Nova you start getting this less. Also, end of silver is pure p90/auto cancer because people want to get nova 1 lol.

Not coming from a silver btw.     Novas are still pretty bad though, no offense (Wouldn't call myself, and LE/LEM, good either). Solo queue in nova/silver is horrendous as there are just not strats whatsoever. In higher level play, people actually know a bit about the game and what should be done in which situations.

A 5 man premade is so much better though, if they're actually good and don't have that one shit talker/toxic player. They should be way more organised, but sometimes just fuck about giving you an easy game anyway.     ""alright"" mate, those drops are sick compared to what I got. I hope you're trolling though.  The inner Hiko coming out!       That is your opinion. That however does not change the fact it's a near perfect map. With near perfect I mainly mean the balance of it, which is quite close to 50/50 with a slightly higher percent on T-side if I'm correct.      Coming from a nova 4... No wonder. ""Rush B"", ""Rush A long"", ""Rush A short"" and whatnot. That's nova.      Hmm, agree and dissagree. CBA to reply properly right now though, however, I get where you're coming from.     If you can kill 1 to 2 enemies pushing at long, that is fine. That means you also have info whether there are more players pushing or not so you can judge whether your team should rotate or not. If you back off and go to ct ramp/elevator, make sure there is someone on your team watching short. If not then either go into ct spawn and watch cross or go car at a slight off angle and kill a couple of them pushing.

On T-side, don't rush long if you don't have a long spawn. If you do have one, flash over twice. Once outside of long and one in long (You can easily do both while running to long), this way you can pre-fire the corner at the cost of you getting naded and lose some HP, or death if you straight up miss your shots. If you have a long spawn no one should be able to get to pit quickly unless you see them first.

Before pushing short, smoke off x-box, the other team may indicate that your team could be pushing short, but you can still go OR fake it. When pushing short make sure to check every single angle, however dont just rush it like an idiot and get awped by someone on site/goose. You can also use nades, flashes and smokes yourself to push in obviously.

If you want to push into B from upper tunnels you can flash in twice (also able to do so while running), this should flash nearly anyone on site because they'll turn away from the first flash then look at the second one because they turn back around. The only angles the could be at with full vision is the big box, in site behind boxes, fence (unlikely if rush from a B spawn) or on the close right next to tunnels on the boxes. If you want to push it slowly, throw a smoke and bounce it off the wall so you can't get shot from site, make sure to check back of plat and the big box before rushing in (maybe molotov either) and then when going in check on the boxes on the right, car and door. (And fence but usually there's no one here.) 

I don't get why everyone says that it's a hard map to play or that they can't get kills, because the other team is. They're players just like you and should be at the same skill group. Adapt to your opponent aswell, remember this.     If GTR would go to C9, Sean would start coaching. If swag however get's unbanned, he will most likely get on the team and Sean will also be coaching.     Yeah I get that I guess. Personally, my most played map is dust 2. I've had a lot of shit teammates, but also a lot of nice ones. It's mainly in the lower ranks where the cancer community hides. Once you get around MG you usually get nice players, this is from my own experience at least. I personally haven't had much trouble with derankers, but if I have them on my team, instead of whining and raging like a bitch I just play along and try to make it a fun match for myself. The game isn't about a couple pixels on the screen showing your rank, it's about fun. If you derank, even though you belonged in the higher rank, you'll rank up again in no time. I'm currently LE/LEM and to be honest haven't met many hackers at all. I get the blatant wall hacker every so often but that's about it. I don't play dust all that much myself though, I'm mainly a fan of the   ""weirder"" maps (Maps which not as many people play) like Cobblestone, Overpass and Train. However a dust every couple matches is still fun for me.     You die at mid by crossing? Use a nade/smoke, if they've been prefiring it just wait a bit before actually crossing when the smoke goes down. Not sure how you always die at mid lol. Just because you can't play some areas of the map doesn't mean it's a bad map. It's just that other players are better on it. Learn to adapt to the playstyle of the enemies and do unexpected shit.      I'm guessing you hate it due to popularity and overplaying it? Because I think everyone can agree Dust 2 is a near perfect competitive map for CS.     Ikr, I have a pretty high sens, but my crosshair doesnt jitter like that whatsoever     100% agree Anders.     Rap god or csgo caster? lel     Confirmation emails bro, you'd have to have their mail account aswell if it's guarded by steamguard.      Yh I agree that'd be awesome     Full control like papa biceps :)     Apparently you were able to crash servers if you bought too many lol     Well... Rip.  Valve removed spam buying.  You can now only purchase 3 of each weapon in a round and only 1 zues per round. Thought I'd let people know, not sure if this was known yet. :)

EDIT: Apparently it's 5. However when I tested this offline I could only buy 3 of each.      Could you do one for G2?
     My fps was 250+ and after the update it still is. However, some people have had their FPS drop from 250+ to 100 with a 144hz monitor (which is awful). Some have even had their FPS drop from 250+ to 60 or less which is horrendous. For some of my friends the game is unplayable due to the FPS drops.     The viewmodel though...
     Could you do some for G2? :D

Ty for doing this, it's awesome :)
   Snoop Dogg gives heartfelt speech while inducting Tupac into the HOF       Not a big fan of it myself, the only trap album I honestly really like is Travis Scott's Rodeo. I'd give it a try if I were you, even if you dislike trap a lot.      Yeah agreed his album is actually really good, went way past my expectations. Went into it thinking I'd be unimpressed just like when Zayn came out with his solo album, but this was a pleasant surprise.     I disliked One Direction a lot, gave Zayn's solo album a listen and wasn't impressed at all. This album however... Wow, not something I expected. I'm blown away tbh. Never expected something so good to come out of a former 1D member.  Run The Jewels - Legend Has It       Check out her Cheek to Cheek album. It's a collaborative album with Tony Benett, pretty much just jazz.     Lady Gaga comes to mind for me. Started out doing pop music, was insanely popular, then just went to do Jazz for a while.     Stfu my nigga  Wholesome joji is best joji 3       Yeah which is exactly why he doesn't break character that often and why he deleted joji vlogs. Such a shame tbh.     I used to be like you tbh, it took me a while to really understand why it isn't just trash. The Money Store was my first introduction to them, took me multiple listens to start enjoying it but it definitely grew on me. Their production is absolutely insane.     Yeah I honestly love seeing him out of character, seems like a really lovable and chill guy to be friends with.     And you don't believe those songs I mentioned convey their meaning in a unique and interesting way? Because in my opinion they do. To each their own though.     So you decide to pick out two lines from one of his most mainstream and banger tracks? Also those lines do fit the message of the track to be humble, but I admit that it's not his best work.

But lyrically he is in my opinion one of the best, if not the best, of this generation. Listen to To Pimp A Butterfly, a few tracks I'd check out purely for lyrics: These Walls, How Much A Dollar Cost, Black the Berry.

Even if you don't like his lyrics, you gotta admit there's a good message behind most of the songs he puts out. 

I will say that a lot of people rate his lyrics TOO highly like there's a really deep meaning behind every line, but just ignore those people. 

     I'm just trying to be nice man lol.     I get where you're coming from. Most mainstream music is really mediocre, but there's a few great songs that gain a lot of popularity every now and then. But it's been like this in every generation. 

I'd check out [THIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be_HVMwiBAM) video which talks about that subject.     I highly recommend listening to The College Droupout, Late Registration and My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. Those are in my opinion his three best records and each one of them has some of the best production ever. I'd avoid a few of his other albums, but music is subjective. I for example hate Yeezus, yet there are lots of people loving it.

Kanye's personality may be annoying, arrogant, egotistic whatever, but he sure as hell can produce some amazing music. 

Hope you end up checking out those records and at least enjoy them for the extremely good production.     They're a Hip Hop duo who gained a lot of popularity after their debut album Sremmlife. Their music falls under the genres pop rap, trap rap, southern hip hop etc. You could basically describe it as ""turn up"" music, so music to just party and get crazy to.

A few songs by them which you could check out if interested are: Black Beatles, Shake It Fast, By Chance, No Type etc.     That's part of his appeal in my opinion. Not every artist has to go hard as fuck or really aggresive with their voice. And honestly even Kendrick can go hard if he wants to (DNA, m.A.A.d City, Blacker the Berry), but he just decides not to on every track he produces.

What else don't you get about him? Why people love his albums/music so much? Go listen to the entirety of Good Kid m.A.A.d City and To Pimp A Butterfly. Read the lyrics while listening. It's way different from any other hiphop artist of this generation. Especially To Pimp A Butterfly, it's a damn masterpiece.  Wholesome Joji (Filthy Frank)       Honestly love seeing how different Kendrick looks here from how he looks now. He always has a new distinguishable look with every album. And also always a new sound.

I love this Schoolboy Q song too, but there's so many better ones he's come out with in my opinion. Not saying it's a bad track though.     I would DEFINITELY check out Injury Reserve - Floss if you're a hip hop fan, such a shame that there aren't many people who have heard it before. One of my favorite albums from 2016.     [Outside feat. 21 Savage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQgvrzmal6o)     Death Grips - Hacker

Mac Miller - Two Matches 

Brother Ali - Sleepwalker

Desiigner - Panda

Nas - The Message

     Already follow GaLm and most of the derpcrew, love those guys :)     I need to go back and watch Seamus play some Fallout 3/Vegas or Borderlands 1, those were the days man..     Really? I often see Cole being criticized, but this is probably the first time I've ever seen this sub shit on Joey. Usually this sub is really positive about Joey.     Favorites: Submission, Busted and Blue, Ascension, Charger, Momentz, The Apprentice

Least favs: Halfway to the Halfway House, Out of Body, We Got The Power, Hallelujah Money     Yep, all of sudden his album isn't great anymore and he's too pop for this sub lol.      Me Against The World by Tupac is better imo     Illmatic and To Pimp A Butterfly are the two best hip hop albums of all time imo. Couldn't really argue with anyone saying either one of those is the best.     Good track, but other outshine it imo.     Am I the only one who feels like the only reason this is getting upvoted so much is because of Thorin?

Nonetheless, good fragmovie. I enjoyed it.     Shoulda kept the ""you smelly cuck"" in your comment then lmao     I don't think he'll give it a 7, I'm feeling more of a 5 or 6 from him tbh     I really don't enjoy that song, it's just so corny     k.
     He liked The Let Out and Ascension, but I honestly don't think he'll like the whole project. Should be an interesting review though.     https://open.spotify.com/album/0NvirtaDCaZU5PAW1O5FDE

Should be out now  Gorillaz - Humanz (Deluxe)       Been listening to it since it came out for me over 5 hours ago and my opinion hasn't really changed. A few tracks are skippable for me like We Got The Power, Hallelujah Money, Out Of Body, Halfway To The Halfway House. They're not really growing on me. I feel like the first half of the record is great, but it definitely falls a bit flat in the second half.

That's just my opinion though, hope I don't get bombarded with downvotes or anything lol.     midnight  Finally out in the US, have fun listening boys!       I honestly think Vince Staples feature is still one of the best. Danny Brown's verse is awesome too.     Listened to this earlier this night when it came out in EU, anyway I think the album is solid, but it's not amazing or anything. Definitely a few stand out tracks like Ascension, Busted and Blue, Submission, Charger etc. but then there's also a few skippable tracks like Hallelujah Money, We Got The Power, Out Of Body.

So overall I'm feeling a strong 6 to a light 7. (Fantano will probably give it a 5 lmao)


Edit: Guys I get it, some of you like We Got The Power, Hallelujah Money etc. this is just my honest opinion. Everyone has their preferences.     Actually dude check out Mortal Man, all the verses on it are clean and you could use his poem and the thing at the end of the track. 

https://genius.com/Kendrick-lamar-mortal-man-lyrics     Check out some stuff by Aesop Rock, dude has the biggest vocabulary in rap and I'm pretty sure a lot of his tracks are relatively clean.

Check out [None Shall Pass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeh6jhHLgtg) for example     Nah bro, not clean at all lol     Midnight like the rest of the world I assume, so a bit less than two hours for you :)     Not a Drake fan or anything, but with him it really just depends on the song. If we're talking If You're Reading This It's Too Late kinda tracks than he ain't boring at all, if we're talking Views... then well yeah, he's pretty boring.     I honestly thought The Heist was a very enjoyable album.     I mean each album is different, but I'd give Demon Days a go first.      I posted a thread over an hour ago when it came out in EU, got removed cuz it's not out in America I guess.     Finished the whole album and honestly I don't think it was amazing or anything, but it was still a very solid album. 

EDIT: Elevator is a BANGER btw, like holy fuck that track goes hard     Haven't finished the full album so I may edit this:

1. Submission

2. Busted and Blue

3. Ascension     Yeah that track is fucking insane     Where you from? America? If it's not available for you guys then you gotta wait til midnight.     UK? :p

I haven't listened to the leak yet so this is gonna be great :)     12:09 am, it got released at midnight on spotify for us  Humanz released in Europe       Pretty much all of To Pimp A Butterfly by Kendrick Lamar in my opinion.

EDIT: BLOOD into DNA on DAMN. also by Kendrick Lamar and honestly most of Good Kid m.A.A.d City goes well together since it's just one big story.  Chance the Rapper - Same Drugs [Hip Hop]       [Excuse me sir, do you have a moment to talk about Corey Feldman?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_OJhSGG078)     Goddamn Australians and their early releases.     Can people stop comparing these two to each other already? Jfc  [FRESH] Joji - I Don't Wanna Waste My Time (OFFICIAL)       Kinda hard to fuck up a WWII game, but you never know I guess.     I can't imagine that they'll fuck this up, but if they do I'm giving up on CoD for good. CoD 2 is probably my favorite game in the franchise and this is looking promising.     [Kendrick  Lamar - For Free?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZTYgq4EoRo)         You realise 8 hours a day is almost the same as a full time job right?       Am I the only one who actually likes Joey's album more than Kendrick's? Don't get me wrong, Kendrick's abum is great as well but I just enjoyed this record more. I'm sad it didn't sell that well though, it sold even less than Joey's last album, didn't it? He deserves much more praise imo.

Joey and Kendrick have the two best hip hop albums of the year so far imo.     Tyler, the Creator is legit the funniest artist out there. His music may not be the best, but his personality is awesome.     To be fair, that's probably the only great Nicki verse out there lol.     Alright I'll try to find it this week and will reply to you again once I find it :)     16 year old here, looking to get into vinyl


So before you roast me for being a hipster or something, no I'm not. I'm really just a music lover and would like to experience the real warmth of vinyl and to own physical copies of my favorite records rather than listening to them on spotify.

My birthday is coming up on the 6th of may so I thought this would probably be a good time to get into it. Anyway, which starter turntable would you guys recommend? I was thinking the Audio Technica LP120, but I still find that kind of expensive if I'm gonna be honest.

Also I think my mom has an unused Pioneer from the 90s stashed away somewhere upstairs, I'm not sure what exact model it is, but I heard old Pioneers are usually pretty good right?

One final question: Would you recommend just getting a second hand amplifier or would a new one be way better?

Sorry if any of these questions seem stupid, I've read a bit into it and know which red flags to avoid (Ahem crosley), but it'd be nice to get some help.     Wasn't this posted yesterday? Why'd it get removed?     Man I couldn't get tickets in time, so bummed out. Could get them, but I'd have to pay a lot more which sucks.     Yes, I'm aware of that, but in every couple tracks Kendrick reads the poem and adds a couple of lines. Those last few lines usually tell the theme of the upcoming tracks. The poem get's longer and longer throughout the whole album and then is read in its entirety on the last track.

The part I mentioned is the part of the poem he read just before the track U on These Walls, with those last few lines saying something about the theme of the track U.     Uhm no, they're from the end of These Walls, leading up to the track U.     Came out on January the 13th, 2016     Kinda like ""Omg I can't get enough of this it's so amazing"" I guess? I'm not a professional emoji translater lmfao.     People definitely do this, especially older people believe it or not lol. They spam emojis instead of just using one or two.     I love Death Grips, Kendrick Lamar, Danny Brown, Run the Jewels, Clipping, Kanye West (his older stuff though), A Tribe Called Quest, Tyler the Creator and many more.

Also would like some R B recommendations, want to get more into that genre.

Recommend me shit fam, would love to listen to some lesser known artists. But feel free to recommend anything and I'll give it a try, will edit my post to say what I thought about some of the recommendations.     Exactly, in the poem leading up to this track it also mentions him being depressed and screaming in a hotel room, so the video fits it perfectly. Here's the part of the poem leading up to the track for anyone wondering.



""I remember you was conflicted

Misusing your influence

Sometimes I did the same

Abusing my power, full of resentment

Resentment that turned into a deep depression

Found myself screaming in a hotel room""     I decided to post this music video here because it is pure art in my opinion. I have no idea how it only has 9 million views, it deserves a lot more than that.  Kendrick Lamar - God Is Gangsta       I wouldn't call his music amazing myself, but it's fucking awesome as turn up music when you just wanna get crazy and dance or whatever. I was a bit disappointed by his New English album since it just felt extremely rushed, but the singles he's put out since then have all been very enjoyable.     This. When he gives something a 5 it's mediocre, a 6 means he liked it but there's still a lot of flaws, an 8 means it was great with few flaws. 7 is right in between that and I can agree with his rating tbh even though I would've given it an 8 myself.     Yeah the reversed part was very creative, I don't think I've ever heard an artist do that before on an album.     18 comments but none are showing? The shadowbans are real lol

EDIT: I love this track btw, top 5 for me on the album. But I've yet to look up what the reversed part says, could anybody tell me what it says?      have fun being banned     you're not funny   ",0

And no guys, it isn't CGI or a robot . Just luck. Or misfortune depending on how you look at it.

Edit: Since this is getting pretty popular and some of may be curious about what this show actually is, I'll explain it here. The show is called Running Man, a Korean variety show. Basically it involves the cast and often guests competing to finish missions, usually set around Korean landmarks, for prizes. Guests have included Jackie Chan, Park Ji Sung and a lot of K-pop groups like Big Bang and 2NE1. I'll leave some of my favourite clips here so you can get a better idea of the show.

Yeah, that was a bit out of left field.  Battle Royale (2000) Discussion  I don't know if this will receive much attention since this movie may not have been seen by many on this subreddit, but I would love to hear others' thoughts on this classic. 

Personally, I loved it. A standout was the scene with the poison which was simultaneously exhilarating and heartbreaking. The story kept me on the edge of my seat, I never felt safe for any of my favourite characters. Shout out to [Mimura](#spoiler), he was the real MVP of this movie.

Jre has said that he's short in one of his videos. Forgot which one, but he was amazed at a guy being 6ft. Might have been Monsta X.     That movie terrified me when I first saw it. Might look at it again now.     Seriously though, that song is amazing. The MV on the other hand....     go away.     Not the best story wise but definitely one of the most entertaining MVs ever.     For me it has to be 'Melted' by AKMU. An emotional story that really showed the cold nature of many adults. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUCIzn0mRHc  Which music video that you've seen has, in your opinion, the best storyline?       The exact same opening sequence was on r/movies like 10 days back. Hope this video has been made with permission and not been totally ripped off      It's all the smirking and taunting that the guys were doing when they threw the last man out that annoyed me. Wish I saw a slower death for some of them      I actually hated the Ravager crew more. When they threw Yondu's loyal guys out I was so pissed off. So happy Yondu killed everyone of them.

Edit: Also, a special hatred goes to the guy who poured booze all over baby Groot. 

**Fuck. That. Guy.**     Seriously though, the actress (Pom Klementieff) is so, so pretty. I think I might be in love.     Groot bringing the toe and Quill unashamedly flirting with the golden girl brought the biggest laughs in my cinema.      I'm just really, **really** happy they played 'Father and Son.'     Mantis crying after feeling Drax's emotions was so touching.   The most vicious dunk I've ever seen (College Basketball)       Ugh. I'm so sick of your shit.     Can we have a source so I can join in all the jeering?     Now I'm reminded of this:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtLZHOgtIlA     That was a perfect roll though.     Apparantly Fernandinho didn't get the memo.     Where can I find more videos like this (preferably EPL though any of the major leagues would be cool)? I found it really interesting.     For real? I'm scared to look for evidence.     Oh no. Its definitely impressive . But not the biggest around. My personal thoughts are that Jason Momoa would have the crowning cock.     We'll put this in the next ama      Really? I think it would be about 8 inches. Not small. But not too huge.     R u serious.. my friend left after two post credit scenes to get food. Guess i've got to watch it a second time      I wanted an angsty, teenage Groot.     I'm such an idiot. I actually went there before looking for it but only looked at the top bit and thought it hadn't been translated. Thank you!      Different language     In a different language I meant.

Also, coincidentally just downloaded Kokoro today so I will check it out.  Summarize your favorite anime in five words or less.  ALSO, please write down the name of the anime in your answer.

I'll start us off.


Anohana - Will inevitably cry for Menma.

Fairy Tail - Erza Scarlet = waifu

Haikyuu - Made me love volleyball. HYPE.

Noragami - Best OP ever

Toradora - Feels for Minori  Which anime character angered/annoyed you the most? (Possible Spoilers)  How did their actions/attitude anger you?

I just finished watching AnoHana and I loved it and have sympathies for the MC 'Jintan.' However, his cold attitude at times was so annoying. For example when Anaru was crying to him and he brushed her off, that sucked.    :(  

Still a 10/10 anime though.

Edit: Also, Yukiatsu from Anohana was a douchenozzle the entire series. Jesus christ. Give Jintan a break you knob.  Besides religious views, what is a belief you have that is contrary to what is commonly held?       1. AnoHana
2. Toradora
3. Haikyuu
4. Fairy Tail
5. Noragami     NORAGAMI!!!!!! The OP alone will make you love it :D     I've seen it already. I really liked it though and am waiting for more eps (don't know if more will come out). Also the OP was so catchy.     Looking just for any good anime. Preferably with a bit of comedy in it. And a school setting would be nice. I watched Toradora and it was brilliant. Just finished AnoHana and I loved it. Clannad wasn't for me (though I only watched 2 eps so I might pick it up again later).      Your description of Shokugeki no Soma exactly matches my thoughts on Haikyuu so check it out if you havn't seen it. You won't regret it!  :)     The reveal is at 4:38 if you want to skip ahead.

'Masayume Chasing' from Fairy Tail is really good as well.      Should have specified. Ozil will get POTY if Arsenal get a better striker who won't let him down. Will fix it now.     I know. I'm really hoping he changes this year though. That goal against Lens and against the other team today (forgot their name) have gotten my hopes up.     I'm trying to fix it. So frustrated.  English Premier League 2016-17 Predictions  A new, exciting season is brewing. Several, huge managers have joined the fray. And class players like Ibrahimovic, Gundogan, Mkhitaryan, Kante and Guzan have signed on. With these predictions, I tried to remain as unbiased as possible. Let me know what you think in the comments. Considered opinions would be preferable over mindless abuse.



**STANDINGS**

Manchester City

Man City has arguably the most talented squad in the PL. The addition of a fine manager in Pep Guardiola will push them to the top along with signings like Nolito and Gundogan. Kevin De Bruyne is also a player to watch out for. And Aguero is undoubtedly world class.
*Team MVP - Kun Aguero*

Manchester United

As my friend has reminded me gleefully for the past month, United have Ibrahimovic. Though he is nearing the end of his career, Ibra is still playing amazing football. The uber talented Mkhitaryan may take some time to adapt to the PL, but he is sure to rack up many assists with Ibra leading the line. At the opposite end of the field, Smalling and De Gea will be relied on with defence. A certain transfer target could also push United to first place. This will be a huge improvement on United's apPAULling previous season ;)
*Team MVP - David De Gea*

Arsenal

The urgent cries for a striker have grown louder as other teams make serious moves. Though Giroud may be talented, he will not be able to carry Arsenal to the peak. Granit Xhaka is an amazing signing who will solidify the midfield. Mertesacker's unfortunate injury will mean that Arsene Wenger will definitely be signing a new defender. Yet again, Sanchez and Ozil will be the main stars in this squad. The addition of a better striker would mean even more assists for the world class CAM.
*Team MVP - Mesut Ozil*

Chelsea

Though some may see 4th as a failure, I see this as a huge improvement. The team came 10th and forced my mate into hiding last season. Though the squad has obvious talent, and additions like Kante and Batshuayi, I think it will take some time for Chelsea to shake off the poor form of last season. Ivanovic and Matic will have to step up. Courtouis has been dissapointing. Fortunately, Hazard was very good in the Euros. Fans will hope he can carry this form into the new season, Chelsea's season relies on him.
Team MVP - Eden Hazard

Liverpool

I love Klopp. LOVE him. He is a manager who is charismatic and who can lead the team successfully. Though Liverpool will not break into the top 4 they will come close. Matip and Sakho will be lead a solid defence, and the addition of Mane will definitely be beneficial. Coutinho is an exciting, young CAM who is capable of taking control of the game. Karius is a young proven goalkeeper with WC potential who may take the starting spot when returns from injury this season if Mignolet underperforms.
*Team MVP - Phillipe Coutinho*

Tottenham

The Spurs were impressive last season, until the final few games which would have given fans sleepless nights. Their defence will again be led by Alderwield, who was one of the stars of last season. Lloris is a WC goalkeeper who is sometimes overlooked. Wanyama and Janssen are new signings who will be valuable additions. The attack will be led by Eriksen and Harry Kane. Though Kane was disappointing in the Euros, he will bounce back in the PL and be one of the top goalscorers.
*Team MVP - Harry Kane*

Leicester City

*Team MVP - Riyad Mahrez (Vardy if Mahrez leaves)

West Ham

*Team MVP - Dimitri Payet*

Southampton

*Team MVP - Virgil Van Djik*

Everton

*Team MVP - Romelu Lukaku (Ross Barkley if Lukaku leaves)

Stoke

*Team MVP - Xherdan Shaqiri

Crystal Palace

*Team MVP - Steven Mandanda

Swansea

*Team MVP - Ashley Williams*

Watford

*Team MVP - Troy Deeney*

Middlesborough

*Team MVP - Victor Valdes

Bournemouth

*Team MVP - Jordan Ibe*

West Brom

* Team MVP - Jose Rondon*

Sunderland

*Team MVP - Jermain Defoe*

Hull City

*Team MVP - Abel Hernandez*

Burnley

*Team MVP - Andre Gray*


**TEAM OF THE SEASON**

RB - Hector Bellerin (ARS)

CB - Chris Smalling (MU)

CB - Toby Alderwield (TOT)

LB - Luke Shaw (MU)

CDM - Granit Xhaka (ARS)

RM - Riyad Mahrez (LEI)

CAM - Mesut Ozil (ARS) + Player of the Season IF Arsenal get better striker

LM - Eden Hazard (CHE)

ST - Zlatan Ibrahimovic (MU)

ST - Kun Aguero (MC)


RESERVES


Kevin De Bruyne (MC)

Laurent Koscielny (ARS)

Petr Cech (ARS)

Dimitri Payet (WH)

Alexis Sanchez (ARS)

N'golo Kante (CHE)

Moussa Dembele (TOT)

Virgil Van Djik (SOU)

Phillipe Coutinho (LIV)


**Biggest Improvement**

1. Alex Oxlade Chamberlain - Very impressive in preseason. Did you see that goal against the mexican team??!? If he can carry that form into the new season he could be instrumental to Arsenal's success

2. Eden Hazard - Will return to form after the fiasco that happened last season

3. Kelechi Iheanacho - Will continue to develop into a huge player for Man City

4. Jordan Ibe - More game time at Bournemouth. He still has potential to develop into a star.



**Leading Goalscorers**


1. Kun Aguero

2. Zlatan Ibrahimovic

3. Harry Kane 

4. Alexis Sanchez

5. Eden Hazard


**Leading Assists**


1. Mesut Ozil

2. Kevin De Bruyne

3. Christain Eriksen (TOT)

4. Eden Hazard

5. Dusan Tadic (SOU)     Yep. Starting XI     Koscielny is a beast :) and would be a huge upgrade. Schneiderlin for Kante is debateable though. I actually rate Schneid.     Who would you be trading out?  If you could take any player from your league who would you take, BUT they'll be traded with your own team's player in that position.  RULES

-Can only be players from your team's league

-Can't switch a player from their main position. (Eg. Alaba can play at CB but he mainly plays at LB, so you can only trade with your own LB.)

-Only players in the team's starting XI (edited in)

My choice would be Aguero for Giroud. I have great respect for him, and he's been consistently great (though injuries are an issue). Second choice would be Smalling for Mertesacker. I like Merts as a person but not as a player. Smalling is much faster.     Yeah, but Gray and Erza were the first of the original four (five if you include Happy) to be together. And I love their dynamic when they're by themselves.

     Stupid, sexy Flanders!     Same thing for me with Walter White - Breaking Bad. I can't hate him.     ""I like men now.""     Kent: 'Could Homer Simpson be a communist? His father spoke out on his behalf.'


Abe: 'Homer is not a communist. He may be a pig, a liar, an idiot, a communist, but he is NOT a PORNSTAR.'      I just started it! I hate him. But my friend said he was one of his favorite characters so maybe if I continue the show I will see a different side to him.     It's not really a quote nor is it funny, but the episode where Homer gets the job at the nuclear plant to support his family (Maggie especially), was really touching. The 'Do it for her' poster was so heartwarming.  Which person (fictional or non fictional) do you love to hate and/or hate to love?       Am I the only one who'd rather have Erza x Gray over Erza and Jellal?     Real shame. Wanted to see him vs Pepe again :(     Guess this means no Diego Costa to Atletico move   What's your favorite video that is 30 seconds or less?       HAHA! Huh? ew.     'baby in the corner' - Fall Out Boy     Is it from Malcom in the Middle?      Mesut had enough of assisting his own players. He's decided to assist the opposition as well.     I'd like to see this since I wasn't able to watch it on the stream due to my unbelievably shit internet.     Jesus Christ. Spare a thought for me. I genuinely can't watch 5 straight seconds of this stream without my internet causing it to buffer.     Alli's out? Damn. I wanted a Xhaka - Alli fight.  What is the most ridiculous argument you've witnessed?       People are downvoting you but you're actually so true.     If Mesut wanted to be my boyfriend, I would seriously consider it.     And in this image he looks exactly like Pewdiepie.

Bizarre.  Troy Baker looks strangely like a male version of Natalie Dormer       The phone call to the sister near the end had such good acting. I was on edge.     My knowledge on football outside BPL isn't the best but I knew he had killed it at Dortmund so I figured he should perform well with Pep at City as well. Also he was only worth about 5 when I got him so it was a low risk situation.     GK: Heaton 
Def: Walker, Bellerin, Shaw 
Mid: Lallana, Sanchez, Gundogan, Allen
Att: Lukaku (C), Aguero VC (damn), Costa

Bench: Capoue, Jakupovic, Amat, Kingsley     74 with Lukaku (C), Costa and Allen to go. Very pleased.     For once I have nothing to complainvl about with 74. Well, only a minor thing because the C is on Lukaku and I had Sanchez, Aguero and Gundogan. Anyway, 3 more players left; Costa, Luk and my saviour Joe Allen.     Have u played ur C yet?     This is glorious.     Its come to the point where I'm starting to feel bad for Moyes.     Go again!     I was here before the bot.     First Walcott, now Giroud. Where's Sanogo?     Two mirrors? You bots are too good for us.     He is quite good looking, yes.     Batman.     Wtf yes!!! I've never even heard of this cinema tho!?

He is from Bahia Blanca, a city in the province of Buenos Aires, but maybe he lived in Crdoba.     Juan Domingo Pern was clearly a fascist and hated communism exactly like Hitler. Clear influence from both him and Mussolini      As an Argentine, I can confirm this. I grew up in a city in Patagonia in which there was a clear German influence. Even before the Nazis, the first high school was built in 1907 due to the late 1880's and 90's European immigration. Specially from Italy and Germany. Many tools and ideas were brought from Europe.
When the Nazis lost the war, many went to Argentina, and their influence was clear. Known ones such as Adolf Eichmann, Joseph Mengele or Erich Priebke (who was the owner of a delicatessen in my town, and my mom even met him in person) were not even afraid to admit they were Nazis, yet showed no signs of control whatsoever. The European community was always respected in Argentina but never seamed to have controlled any aspect of the country.
My point is that there is definite influence, but as from control I don't think so.

It is quite obvious what they did and what their intentions were. I don't think being innocent and naive would be their case.     Ok, maybe I didn't quite explain myself. To begin with, I'm argentine. You are too very probably. I'm not saying that acting like dicks is ok, that is why I say that they ""knew the risks"" of what they were doing. Bitching around saying ""oh these brute argentines are assholes"" is not quite acueste on their side, but I'm focusing on us now. The Malvinas war was no different than any other war. Many argentine soldiers died (649 soldiers to be exact) but again, you probably already know this. Is it tragical? Yes. But it happened more than 30 years ago. Humor about tragical things is very common in us humans especially in places like Reddit, don't lie to yourself; The Nazis, 9/11, etc. The fact that they got attacked for making humor out of something tragic is not deserved in my opinion, because then events like ""je suis Charlie"" should be justified with the same explanation; ""they deserved it"". And solving conflicts with violence is simply not the way to behave in my opinion.      They didn't ""deserve"" it. Wrecking their cars made the world think argentines are brute, which they aren't. But it is true top gear knew the risks of their provocations.     Yeah. Their special began in Bariloche, which has an incredible landscape which they loved.

For everyone: How did you come up with ""Gorillaz""     To whom it may concern: You must be VERY careful when discussing topics like this. Argentina is portrayed as dark, enslaved and hopeless in those years, and all the blame is put in the military. I am just going to present the other perspective of history, simply to make people comprehend a more ""accurate"" truth overall. Just to demonstrate not everything is black and white.

From the years 1976 to 1983, Argentina went through a military dictatorship, and that is true. It went through a ""terrorism of state"" phase, and that is also technically true, given that the definition of that is vaguely saying that a non political group took the state's faculties by force. The military made the wrong decisions when in power? Definitely. Were they wrong in taking the government by force? Probably also true. For now, I'm going to explain WHY this happened, given that is quite important and most people omit this part.
Before the government was taken by the military, there was a clandestine war. A war started by the communist/socialist/populist or whatever you want call it groups. They were terrorists. People may admit it or not, but they were. They would kill people, impose their beliefs and cause terror. The people of Argentina were scared and the government was totally inefficient against these clandestine groups, so the people asked the military for help. They were already fighting these groups, but thought that as the government was inefficient, they should govern. Obviously they had the United State's support for obvious Cold War reasons. They had learnt torture methods and all type of stuff to extract information from suspects. 
As they took power, many mistakes were made, but the people weren't opposing it at first. Considering that the fear of Argentina becoming communist was also in the air. Of course, an as history has shown, the military lost the Falkland war and that was the final blow for them. The clandestine terrorist groups became what are now many (and by many, I mean MANY) argentine politicians. As they have had the upper hand for many years, they tried and have succeeded in stripping the military of all dignity, bending the truth completely and making everyone believe ""the BAD military came one day all of the sudden, took the government and started causing terrorism of state"".
Then people like Hebe de Bonafini (leader of the mothers of plaza de mayo), would use this excuse to do as they pleased (her ""missing"" son is living perfectly safe and sound in Germany and she is filthy rich thanks to corruption).
The war between A and B was won by A, and now B has all the fault. Simple idiocracy.
The mothers of plaza de mayo, as families of the soldiers who died in the Falkland war, have grown from 300 in 1985 to 27000 in 2016. Go figure (for those who didn't understand, it has grown because more and more people say that their son died in the war, or went missing by the military, to get benefits from the government or money from corruption).
I just want to say that history and the truth is molded on facts. The more we get the better. I just needed to show, once again, that not everything is so black and white.      EXPLOSIVE DUCKS     But I'm 90% sure they would be happier if they had. You could be happy and have no money, but most probably, having money would solve many problems which make you unhappy. Maybe it should be ""Money reduces unhappiness in most cases""     Definitely   ""Money doesn't buy happiness"" is a phrase mostly used by people who have it       That has been the debate for ages     Literal hunger games      You are a noice person      Deep  What motivates you to wake up every morning?

Oh hi mark     Wow that was good     78 77 76...     Automatically read: ""Beating: 72 months"". Seems about right     Ok. First of all, I'm going to stand by my original point of view which was of elaborating raw materials YOU ARE GOOD AT. Or is your phone's brand ""El celu"", your car ""El carro""? Stop trying to bullshit me with all the ""screw the people who ruin national industry"" because most probably, you don't even care enough about it. If you think a reason why the military came was to power, was to debilitate the national industry, i think it is quite far fetched.
Also, the money which goes to the landowners, then goes to the rest of the country. Be it thanks to taxes, salaries or even buying consumer goods. Being the ""granero del mundo"" was amazing for Argentina in those years. Should it have developed industry in bread, cereal, etc.? Probably yes. Should it have looked for new markets to develop? Yeah, why not. Now, why would it have wanted to produce cars, chairs, light bulbs, if Japan or any other first world country already did it 10 times better? Why buy an ""Anasagasti"" when you could buy a Rolls Royce? 
By saying ""other informal economies"" I don't really know what you are talking about. 
(Plus, we actually agree on the fact that the military didn't randomly took power, and that before them, the conditions weren't all that greater when talking about terrorism? Because that was the only thing I was aiming at. What I hate, is people blaming the military for all the events that occurred back then. Persecuting them only for the ""atrocities"" they caused all while the ""montoneros"" are not even questioned for the crimes of ""lesa humanidad"" they sure also committed)     This has to blow up     I don't really know where this popped up, but I would rather say that a country must focus on generating value on the raw materials it it good with. In the video you showed, it basically states that argentine chair fabrication isn't good, which is true. It isn't its specialty. For this reason it imports.
The agrarian class in argentina is actually not the one in control of political power. This is why there is a lot of tension between the agricultors and politicians. In 2008 there was a ""reforma 125"" which you could look for if you are interested in the topic. Basically it raised the taxes on the agricultors and it even made them stop production in its entirety.

subject3394,"    That's awesome! Did you have any work experience beforehand?  Careers in Economics?  Hey guys, this is my first ever post on Reddit so please bear with me! I'm currently a sophomore in college, and to be blatant I'm not really sure where I want to go in life. To give you a little background, my entire family is analytically-minded; my mom is the Senior Accountant Manager for her company, my dad is an Electrical Engineer, and my oldest brother studied Marketing. Currently I am majoring in Economics, and I wanted to know what careers are out there in this field? I've done some personal research, but all I have found pertaining to this field is being a financial analyst. Just to be clear, I'm going for my BBA in Economics at my University's business school.
   Was the civil war about states rights or slavery?  It seems like I can't find a legitimate answer to this question. My US history professor claimed that the civil war was Lincoln's attempt at holding the union together, because had the confederate states been free, they would have been allowed to secede from the union. But after a lot of research, I have found a different side to it; this side claiming that the civil was solely about the southern states wanting to secede in order to keep the institution of slavery intact. So which is it?     So you work the Department of the Interior?     Psychologist?     That's sounds awesome. What did you study in college?     This is a long haired GS if I'm not mistaken?     All these stunning pictures from Oregon.. I've been curious though, how does Oregon compare to Colorado? Scenery-wise.     Kingdom Hearts 1 and 2     What're you getting a doctorate in?     Wow you don't hear about him in textbooks       'Psychology'     This is breathtaking!      Do employers know what classes you take? Thinking about it, it seems pretty unfair that someone who doesn't take the math/econometrics classes get a higher gpa and get looked at more than someone who took those classes and has a lower gpa.     So is IB more about standing out in college than it is having connections?      Why statistics?     Oh okay, I've heard that IB is pretty hard to break into without connections. Thats honestly what I'm worried about       Thank you for answering in-depth with stellar advice. What do you mean by contractions?     Thank you for clearing that up, I've always wondered what target schools were when people bring it up.
I live in Georgia and the school I attend is Kennesaw State, which is known for its business school. But it's definitely not UGA.      But with someone who has immortality, wouldn't the brain become more elastic over time, being able to retain more information?  If someone was immortal, would they have the mental capacity to be an expert on every subject known to man?        Ahh I didn't know Dementia was that serious, thought it was just about forgetting. In the case, that'd be a terrible life to live...     I'd like to think dementia would be helpful in the fact that they would be able to forget the pain of losing loved ones time and time again.

subject3415,"    I guess I'll have to concede your first two points are true, I didn't know he had that wording on the web page and I'm happy we're in agreement about early access. 

Not saying this makes you wrong or anything but did he really get paid ""millions of dollars?"" I feel that might be a bit hyperbolic I know Cube World is a game a lot of people want but not that many I would guess.      I'd forgotten about the early access release. 

I'll have to see where he promised updates if you could provide a source on that it would be great. 

Besides that point early access doesn't mean you're going to get updates, in this day and age we know this. I remember before then Wollay did not want to do early access for the same reason we're having this discussion; Wollay didn't want to deal with the responsibility and if I recall correctly he made that clear when he released the early access build.

It's one guy making a big game in his spare time...the hell do you want from him?     Star Wars: Jedi Outcast is my personal pick. A great choice if you love FPS like Doom.      SWBF2 was an awesome follow up to the original BF. I played the literal shit out of the first SWBF, SWBF2 turned me off with the super OP Jedi Leaders being playable though. I would prefer and all out shooter devoid of special Jedi characters.

That being said I never got to play Dark Forces growing up but I bought it at at Goodwill a few years back and it was a blast. I love old school shooters. I own Dark Forces 2 on Steam but haven't gotten around to it.      Duke Nukem was passed from developer to developer and the original idea was was no where near represented in the final product. 

It's impossible to compare a one man team who works on this big game in his spare time.

There are some builds that are (or were) available to download. Not a whole lot of content but you can get a feel for the game at least.      Because he wants to release the game in a full state rather than leaking developer builds over the course of several years so the game won't fade to obscurity. 

He says so clearly in the FAQ if you bothered to read it, Cube World ain't gonna be released til Cube World is ready.     Surprising people don't know this...in the FAQ on the site I clearly remember these words:

""When can I buy Cube World?"" 

Answer: When it's done.     You forgot to mention time lines. 

Nearly every time I've seen a developer give reasons for incomplete or buggy game is they didn't have the time to wrap up most of what they wanted to actually get to. 

Maybe what you said is true but I'm more inclined to blame the publishers wanting to get the game out before Christmas season as the main reason some games aren't in development for as long as they need to be.     That just completely kills gem progression and one of the limiting factors of augmenting ancients.

Was farming for gems a thing in the first place?

Unless you're playing one class with of every main stat then your gym progression becomes turning whichever ones you have excess of into the required gem. 

Gem progression is held in the legendary gems, you don't want to waste your augment on a lower level legendary gem.     Star Wars: Jedi Outcast is where it's at tho my man.

How do you know she isn't into vanilla missionary for procreation only sex?     Hello there, as someone who isn't a fan I can say from my perspective that it's the pop-ness of this music that makes it hard to listen to. 

Beyonce is a model, not a pop star. She should really stick to what she is actually good at.      I was being hyperbolic. I'm aware it makes me seem like a gaming hipster of sorts I prefer the days where every had the same skins, guns, and it was just all about the game play. 

There are games where customization is a big feature but I see a lot of games these days where I feel like such things don't belong. As long as people keep paying for them though they will be around so the most I can do is hope the fad doesn't infect my favorite games.      Did you take inspiration from [Floppy Heroes](http://store.steampowered.com/app/480450/)?

I love physics based combat games like this. As a suggestion from someone who loves this sub-genre of fighting games if you're going to add in a multitude of weapons or items for fighting please please please balance them in a meaningful way. 

A lot of games like this wind up have a best strategy and it really takes away from the feel of a game when you have a lot of cool weapons but no real reason to use them.     I personally have had a distaste for such a thing ever since they introduced hats in TF2. I stopped playing TF2 after loot boxes started appearing and have actively avoided nearly ALL games that use them. 

I really enjoy CS:GO but most people playing it are more concerned with what my M4 looks like as opposed to what I can do with it...so meh, hardly touch it now these days.
     Please heavens no.      A little spacing between clickable objects is always nice, I came to this thread to tell you to just click better but then I remembered how NPC's in Terraria block everything...so you got a point. 

More space between usable objects!     What if the employees have tidied up to the max already? 

What if everything is done? 

I've gotten such discussions from managers...some people work fast and will have everything clean and done. If they are going to be there for eight hours just because it doesn't take them that eight doesn't mean they still don't deserve hours. 

Otherwise you're just kicking employee moral in the balls.     That was cool of your manager to do. Several jobs I have worked had a ""time to lean time to clean"" mentality that if you weren't doing some form of busy work then you shouldn't be getting paid. 

It's all just a corporate trick to make places look busy to customers.      so why get upset about people stating facts?

The problem is you're asserting steroid use without proof. I wouldn't be upset if they were indeed using steroids but you can't assert that without proving it. That was my point, you're making a false assertion without proof which would be found to be really disrespectful of the hard work those men and women put to suggest it was helped along by substances we look down on people for using. 

I'm not pretending they don't use it, I'm just assuming innocent until proven guilty. Also never said anything about anyone not working hard enough in the gym so...projection maybe? 
     Daniel Bryan, CM Punk, AJ Styles...three recent and huge names in the pro-wrestling world that break the big muscular man stereotype and have never been confirmed to be using performance enhancing drugs. 

How can they be a necessity when the top performers in the last decade have all been moderately sized men with very achievable physiques?     Kind of a big assumption though isn't there?

Calling steroids off the bat just because he's muscular is shorted sighted and ignorant. 

Are they are thing in the professional wrestling business? Maybe for some but performance enhancing drugs are found in a whole myriad of sports, so why is pro-wrestling the one that gets the bad rap for it?

Those dudes work their asses off and writing it off as roids is not only objectively ignorant but also hella disrespectful to everything these dudes do.     There are four places named ""Poop""

http://us.geotargit.com/called.php?qcity=Poop all=cities part=beginning     Let's see...the cat is stealing the bread, hissing, being a bitch and general nuisance...I'd say yea, seems about right to me.     House looks clean, cat doesn't looked malnourished, we know animals exhibit strange behaviors we can't always explain, she was very gentle with the cat the whole time, didn't yell at it when the bag busted, other cats in the video seem real calm and collected (and nice and fluffy.) I would say it's safe to assume everything is fine here.     Yea, not like he just enjoys the game on a personal level or anything. Better make sure your friends only play games that you approve of.     I went back and forth to Burger King six or eight times...I lost count. 

Manager would tell me ""Come back tomorrow at 11am"" and he would either not be there or tell me he didn't have  time for me.      Not arguing with anything you said just wanted to point out Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater came out on the PS2 and ALL the animation is computer animation, no mocap. 

Everything is so highly polished in that game and to be a PS2 game on top of that makes it a marvel of graphical achievement for it's time.

Developer's these days have zero excuses for stuff that looks as shitty as Andromeda.     The internet has a desire to assert sexuality into anything and everything. There was never any indication that LeFou was gay...in this or the original. 

It's people looking for ""holes"" in someone's masculinity and then asserting that they must be homosexual because they either have a great amount of respect and adoration for another man or because they have physical contact with another man, even if it is non-sexual. 

Unless LeFou explicitly states he is or has an explicit homosexual moment there is nothing to contemplate here. It's all buzz surrounding the movie and the modern social movement that is so up in everyone's business about what gender, sex, etc they are the ideas are being pushed into media as well, hence the big to do about nothing of LeFou maybe or maybe not being gay...you decide!  Found a building you can glitch through in bioshock infinite, nothing useful but interesting.        You notice Puma is always getting the shit beat out of him on LU?

I'm excited for the next season, Puma coming back from the dead is going to be interesting.     In all honesty does it make your sex life like tons better? No pun intended.     You need to re-roll that entire thing. It needs CDR and CHC.     This makes me uncomfortable.     First book is great and has a lot of mystery too it and then the rest feel like fan fiction written by the author's child who had a vague idea what the book was about. 

The first book has a few mysteries but the second is like ""HOLY FUCK WHATS THAT"" every two pages.     Let's prepare the ""Lol things are more expensive in Australia!"" 

Fuck off cunt, at your minimum wage you could buy your game than I could buy one in my country for less at my minimum wage. 

If you even out our minimum wages you're making more in Aussie.     I didn't like the film very much.

It doesn't explain anything and has a really weird rapey vibe to it. 

The first scene in the movie is the main character complaining how they didn't leave a woman alive for him to rape as well.      MMO's and Story Immersion really don't go well together. 

Most MMO's will be quest-hub fests because that is the design of an MMO. You want engaging you're better off playing a SP RPG.     You're waiting for an animation to finish at that point. I can see where /u/WarmBagels is coming from. At some point immersion does have t take a back seat to game play otherwise it's not much of a game is it?

In grinding MMO's it would just be inconvenient to have to wait for NPC's to drop in or spawn in a special way. Most players just want their kills so they can move onto farming the next area.

Changing a spawn animation CAN be a QoL improvement especially if you're cutting down on the over all time a player has to spend grinding in an area.      That has to be on of the most click baity trashiest websites I've ever seen.     Hmm...it could possibly be an anti-virus or program related issue. 

Try seeing if it may be an exterior program running that is effecting the game. I know Nvidia Shadowplay used to make me lag all the time.     One is worth money to the restaurant the other isn't.

If you and I are out to lunch and the bill is $20 and I say, ""I don't have ten, but I do have this 50% coupon! It'll be like I paid my half.""

You're going to spend ten either way if we had meals that were even/close in value. Are you upset that I'm not spending money when I don't have to? 

Going somewhere cheaper and having a coupon are not the same thing. One has actual value one just has a value difference.      A lot of people can tell me I'm wrong but it doesn't change my opinion.

If a friend has a physical coupon worth a certain amount and it would cover/more than cover their portion if they were going to use cash anyways why not use it?

It's not like they are making you pay more they just aren't paying anything because bam coupon. That's frugality not cheapness. If they expect you to cover more than their fair share the coupon doesn't cover then that is pushing it and being cheap.      US here, https://www.retailmenot.com/view/dominos.com

No such coupons for us.  Also these coupons aren't always legit...see the success rates?     No, if you had a physical coupon though like my original post suggest then I would.      I'm on the US vouchers are normally special coupons that are priced higher and typically only handed out as special promotions by companies. 

I don't know anywhere I could easily find such a great coupon.     Please link me to a legit voucher code for that much. I can't find them would love to see where these great deals are.     I would because your discount cares for your half of the meal assuming we are splitting the meal as with a pizza.     A 40% coupon and a split between two people is more than fair. I fail to see how him saving you nearly half the cost of your pizza wouldn't justify him having a few slices. Coupons are treated like money by the business as well so in the eyes of the business they would be paying their share.

If we were hanging out and I said dude you got five bucks I got this five dollar off coupon we could split a large two topping you would be upset if I didn't have actual cash instead? If you feel this way your being real petty.     Why? With that large of a discount using it as payment is well justified. Only an fool would turn down a 40% discount of pizza.     A large pizza around where I am is about ten dollars. You say house mates so I'm assuming there are at least three of you. If his coupon covered 30% of the pizza then it would be more than fair for him to use the coupon as payment. Would you rather pay the same price and have him not use his coupon? 

You sound like an ungrateful and condescending turd.     My mom would do this in a heart beat.     My cousin's big fat dark areola when we were teens. She flashed me and I've had a thing for girls with fat saggy boobs and big ol' saucers for nipples.     What kind of internet are you using?

Are you wi-fi or direct cable? 

I get micro-stuttering from time to time because my computer is connected to Wi-Fi and sometimes it just doesn't work as well. Sun spots and all that...     There is in fact no difference between magic truffles and magic mushrooms. They are parts of one and the same organism. Sometimes it is said sclerotia contained a higher amount of active compounds than a fruiting body. Until today, this statement is scientifically not proven.     They can be cheap but jump scares have their place.      I wonder if Young Metallica would hate Old Metallica.     Where in China is this? 

Every time I've seen pictures of major cities they are always really busy and busseling with tons of people. Is this a more private neighborhood or city? Where are all the cars for driving on these hugs roads?

Video just seems real empty compared to all the other footage I've ever seen of China.      Given what a hard on China has for censorship that would make sense. There is probably a whole lot we don't see because they feel it would ruin the countries image.

Really wish the whole world could get past the high school mentality and act like adults...     No it's not. 

Fill up your inventory with Rares and click salvage all, takes one second to get all of them. 

Fill up your inventory with Legends and you need at least half a second to delete each one. I can click and hit return pretty fast but it's always going to be slower than an all button.     Who said two buttons? Just have a salvage all button and make sure to remove the ones you want from your inventory. 

Or maybe we could get a favorites button and an auto-sorting button like ALL the other ARPG's.      A warning window won't save you from that, he could of just as easily done the two click and been away with it. It's his own fault.      I do, it's real easy for me to do a quick mouse over of my inventory and see what I'm keeping and what I'm not. 

After I get going I'll find myself with big inventories of legends only looking for ancients and everything else is instant trash. A salvage all button would be nice.     We used to have to salvage all items one at a time and it didn't require us to also hit enter. I think OP brings up a good point, especially for people who at this point are only farming for Ancients/Primals. 

On T13 you can rack up a whole lot of legends so I could see why someone would want a salvage all button for the legendaries too.     Nope but your system sound will stutter for sure lol.     If you've cleared GR70 with a Whirlwind Barb then you're good to go for quick-farming mats to build other characters. 

You could literally have any other class geared and ready for T40+ easy in just a few hours play doing nothing but collecting blood shards and then gambling them on a fresh character.      8====D~~~      Buddhism comes in the same shit flavor ALL religions come in.     And there is some random crucified dude at the end...holy shit.      So over night at a animal hospital they left not only the kennel unlocked by the front door? Sure. 

Totally real video.     She didn't drop hints like that. You clearly didn't even read the article.     Sounds like you're suggesting we should just move on now...why? It's good all this shit is being dug up they are a terrible company and deserve to be publicly humiliated for their fuck ups as any company should. 

It's good that Reddit is blowing up about it. The attention from us gets it out into the mainstream quicker, soon everyone learns how shitty United is, and hopefully something is done about either by United themselves or a third party with authority to come down on United. 

Either way if you're tired of it go read something else. There is a reason this is news and there are reasons people are digging up United dirt. We want this company down and if the most we can do is share shit about it then that is what we will do.     Special needs and entitled is entirely different. Go on, go live with someone who has full blown autism and see why they were so antsy to get her hot food.      How were both sides shitty?  The woman made a reasonable request that could be carried out quite easily and they still refused. 

From a pure customer service perspective just give them a damn hot food for fuck sake. It's not hard, doesn't come out of anyone's pocket, and would of kept this whole mess from happening in the first place.

Is a diversion and the embarassment of a family as well as the waste of resources by calling both medics and police officers in addition to holding up EVERYONE ELSE ON THE PLANE worth not just giving the woman some fucking hot food?

Anyone who would argue against the family in this case is mental. I really think you just want to play devil's advocate so bad you'll say anything to fit the role.      I think you didn't understand my analogy. 


I'll just be blunt because we've come to a point of disagreement.

If you weren't playing when the cosmetic was only available for current players as a reward you don't deserve it because you weren't dedicating your time to the game at the time. The point of my analogy has nothing to do with the color of the ribbon...you don't even deserve one because you weren't there! 

The exclusive cosmetics are just as desirable to those who dedicate A LOT more time than a casual to moderate player. There should be high end level rewards that you can't get unless you were there. 

Do you think everyone should get party hats in Runecape? They wouldn't be rare and special then. Think of how older players feel when the new players get the same rewards by paying for them that they worked so hard to earn in game. 

Bottom line: If you weren't playing when it was an exclusive then you don't deserve it. It's a status symbol to show a players dedication to the game.      Isn't the point of an exclusive to reward players who where there at the time/showed the dedication to get these cards?

If you miss out you miss out. It's just a cosmetic. Some of you are arguing as if these developers are locking you out of core game content when in reality you're complaining about missing out on a few cosmetics. 

Not to be insulting but it just comes across as a really weak argument. 

In analogy you're mad that you just signed up for a baseball team and didn't get last seasons participation ribbon.      How are you being punished as a new player by not being able to receive the rewards from previous seasons that you didn't play?

You're not locked out of any of the content except for the seasonal transmogs and cosmetics. If you don't play the season you don't get the transmog...that isn't a punishment that is just how it works. 

You're basically asking for a trophy just for signing up to the team...it don't work like that.     So the game should cater to new players by forcing long time players to go without rewards?      I was unaware, due to all the posting about it I thought it was still relevant.      Breeding is not the same as farming, breeding is an aspect of farming but the comparison is pretty loose.      one shot non-lethal weapons to prevent it turning into a bloodbath.

So maybe we just shoot each other with rubber bullets? Sounds fun, like extreme one shot paint ball. 

While I can see there are rules written do you think the modern average person would give any regards to these?

If this were a thing it'd have to be government sanctioned and come with a waiting period, six months maybe. If you still hate someone after six months then duel it out.

I disagree with the whole idea and think it is moronic but should it ever come to pass I hope there would be so much litigation around it setting up a duel would be a paperwork nightmare and a huge headache to discourage people from going through with it.     https://plusblog.org/2012/06/18/congratulations-to-michael-flint-hole-in-one-winner-at-se-chapter-golf-outing/     You aren't one to say they can't but your logic and general care for the health of society sure as hell can. 

I think it's really sick so many people in this thread are seriously asking why this can't be a thing.      basically meant you were in the wrong, or worse, a coward.

No American would want to be called this things, we'd be killing each other left and right.      It could provide an outlet for unhinged, violent people who want to mow down a crowd with a rental truck or shoot up a movie theater audience.

This wouldn't make it a bigger problem?

I used to joke we should have death row inmates fight it out but there would be a lot of legal issues and general moral fucked upness to legalizing sanctioned death bouts.      Why should they?

Imagine the legal problems this could cause. Two people alone, one murders the other and claims they were dueling so it's justified.

You know how many hot headed people will duel it out because it's legal? 

What stops some crazy person from bringing an automatic to a duel?

We don't let people just off and kill each other for many reasons, consent or no consent. Too many complications just to allow some people's egos flare up to an unnecessary degree.      The community made them into a big deal, Valve just introduced the idea to the main stream on one of it's most played games.

You can't blame the company for the product when the consumers are eating it up left and right like hat craving ravenous piranhas.      DLC for free is was a good idea. 

It kept people from abandoning Titanfall 2 like they did the first one. 

     Because crusading for any rightful cause on the internet is usually met by hundreds of nay sayers playing devil's advocate for fun. 

You're not allowed to tell the whole truth in internet reporting, only the exciting and interesting bits. So whichever ones contain violence, sex, or money keep but if it contains truth, thought, or change don't show that shit it won't sell.     You don't farm tigers for anything. Without a real reason to do so you don't. 

If people believed Tiger fang could cure infertility it wouldn't give you a good reason to set up legal tiger fang trade.     Why should a government legalized the entrapment of Rhino's to harvest them for horn shavings to make some idiots homeo-therapy nuts happy?     I agree with this. I think if the video is big enough or relevant enough to spark a needed discussions the rules should be put by the way side for a special exception.      I had one really good one and he did play with me a lot but that was when we had PS2's and the such. Back in the day I played NES/N64 mostly by myself. 

I've never played Goldeneye 007 MP Slaps only on an N64 because  of this. Makes me a little sad. 

Sorry, tangent. I just had trouble socializing at a young age and still kind of do so it's hard for me to make friends with most people because trust and things.      All gear should just dropped as perfect rolled ancients. 

Only Royal Squares should drop. 

All goblins should be blood goblins. 

How much more does Diablo 3 need to hold our hands as players?  I thought maybe increasing the legendary drop rate would be enough for the player base but each season seems to bring more and more easy farming changes. 

If we keep headed this direction we might as well have rifts be zombie only, you start level 70, etc. 

Maybe a bit of a slippery slope but these hand holding changes irritate me. No challenge left in the game except how long you can be bored.      What game do you know of OP that locks necessary content behind a paywall? 

In this example the game is charging you to play 90% of the rest of the game.     Or until you run out of energy to be derived from said salad and bread sticks.      My family nor friends liked playing video games when I grew up...I still would plug in the second controller and zoom around the map. It was never the same though. Shame I can remember the same nostalgic things as everyone else but didn't get to share in it.     What is your point here?

He's not feeding them the duck, the money he makes from the ducks goes to charity.      It's insulting because no one but little kids like Super Roman. He's boring, can't hold his own on the mic, and looks like he's has shit under his lip. 

There are plenty of people on that roster who could hold their own against the Undertaker. 

Kayfabe don't mean nothing when the star in question is poo poo all around.  Roman was great in the Shield...now...ugh.      That is tradition but it's not always true.      Randy Orton during his Legend Killer era. 

If only Randy had been more behaved backstage we could of witnessed the birth of a mega heel in Orton as the Legend Killer. 

Undertaker has even said in interviews that he wanted Randy to end the Streak but Randy didn't want to out of respect. 

The Streak should of never been a prize, you either have to give it off to the perfect person OR keep it intact. 

WWE did neither. They killed the Streak with the Broccoli Laser and then had a few lame matches between ending with The Undertaker jobbing out to Roman Reigns. 

If my entire life revolved around wrestling I'd probably kill myself WWE is so bad. Like...it's really really bad. Have you watched it lately?     Roman was way over when he was the enforcer for the Shield. 

Now he's just an annoying ""big dog"" who gets mega-pushes like there is no tomorrow.

Him wrestling in the last match against the Undertaker may be a death bell for his career. I hope.      So if you have no proof then why believe? I'm interested in your input, I'll probably disagree but I don't mind hearing you out.     Except according to your book God put the tree of good news evil there for the people to eat and he knew they would so why would he put the tree in the garden knowing they were going to eat of it in the first place. Your God is either a really mean prankster or doesn't make sense.     God is good why did he allow Hitler to kill all the Jews? If he had the power to stop him and cared surely he would right?     That is nice and all but do you have any proof of this concept? Where and how did original sin corrupt the world and more importantly what is original sin and why should I believe what you have to say about it?   Terraria QOL Change: The Gravity Potion  ""In only the Console version, you have the option to turn off ""World Flips Upside Down"", making it so only the player flips.""


I NEED this. I don't use the potion because the screen flip makes my eyes hurt and my stomach feel queasy. I can't even look at a spinning circle without getting an upset stomach so it'd be real nice if this was an option we could get on the PC version.      That is a good question. Most games will show the same content regardless of resolution. 

I think in Terraria though this would be an issue graphically. I can see just fine at a high resolution but could you imagine trying to see some of the tiny things in this game at a really low resolution AND zoomed out?     I worked for Wal-Mart for all of about two weeks.

A manager put his hands on me, clasped my shoulder real hard and when I told him not to touch me he slammed his hand down on my shoulder as hard as he could. 

When I asked him what right he thought he had to touch me he told me verbatim that he was manager and could do what he wanted. I even brought this to the store manager, but because this short slimy little fuck was from corporate they decided to just offer me to move positions where I wouldn't have to work with the guy.

I'm a dude and he made me uncomfortable as fuck. He was clearly flirting with the girls on our team and refused to talk to me when I pointed out his touching violated our harassment policy. Management even agreed with me but they wouldn't let us have a face to face meeting. 

I walked out that day letting the head manager know I'm not going to work for a company that won't stand by it's own policies and promote people who abuse their power. 

I suffer from a Generalized Anxiety Disorder and this still makes me cringe and want to cry when I think about.     You don't HAVE to. The Jungle is generally more difficult than other areas, more so in Hard Mode. 

Turtles can kill a player in Molten Armor in just a couple of hits.      No, Thieve is the owner. Are you assuming his multiplicity? /s     I always try to separate the artist from their actions. 

As a big wrestling fan it's hard to go back and watch some of my favorite matches knowing what I now know about some of the bigger names back in the day and how they acted back stage but at some point you just gotta look past the personal stuff for the glory of their art.

Chris Benoit is a prime example. You can't really bring him up without someone mentioning the double murder suicide involving him, his wife, and his kid. Horrible as it may be he still put on some excellent technical matches in his time. I miss him and his art, though he surely suffered backstage. 

Life you know?     Thank you for your tale. I'm tired of all the people I see scoot bootin' around here going over the speed limit with no helmet on and zip zappin' between cars like it's Grand Theft Auto.      Sounds like some sort of prophecy.      Would make an interesting center piece to a garden were it kept properly and trimmed from time to time.      http://imgur.com/a/iCbY2

What about that? Just went and thickened the houses up.     The only way to have more actual screen space is to play at a higher resolution. 

Edit: OP, you're a turd. Down voting me for telling you the truth? Sorry but it's the reality of it, the game would be broken if we could zoom out due to the way mobs spawn and other such factors.   A floating mushroom village I'm working on. Any suggestions?       Actually after having another look and zoomi",0
subject3428,"    I remember reading your comments back when I was more of a lurker on this sub.  Your salt drove my hatred. :D     That battle made me the saltiest man alive. I spent years in the comment section of that video.       In that movie he travels to all the houses by going through mirrors. Mirror Master anyone.     After that fight I became the saltiest man alive.  I am Salt Man     [Here it is](https://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/2v3z11/death_battle_40_gaara_vs_toph/)     To what?     But Toph IS THE GREATEST EARTHBENDER OF ALL TIME!!!!!!!!!^/s     I know of your good work on the Gaara vs Toph post sir.  RIP in pepperonis.      They keep mentioning speed and durability at the end of these last couple of death battles, and I am like where was that during Gaara vs. Toph.     I like the Zoom crashing the party idea. :D      (Loses to someone way less powerful than Superman) ""I am just as good of a hero as him.""     Please no.  The show is actually pretty bad, and the characters(at least for me) are annoying.     I totally agree. By the end of the first episode of the Flash I was hooked, but I just cannot get into this show. I had big expectations for this show, but it seems to be falling flat on all fronts.      Again plot induced stupidity. Why people with guns always walk right up to the main character so they can grab the gun, why villains fight the hero one at a time, why people always miss/ never shoot there guns.     That was purely plot induced stupidity. Fighting skills don't matter when you have super speed in less you are fighting someone of equal speed.      Cloud and Sephiroth are from Final Fantasy 7 which has never been on a nintendo console.     That's because the writers don't know how superspeed and fighting work.     It wouldn't matter if he knew how to fight, Zoom is just so much faster than him. If it looks like Barry is moving in slow motion to Zoom, Barry couldn't hit him. This was a big problem in Flash vs Arrow because it showed Arrow moving in slow motion, so there was really no way(no matter how much martial arts training Arrow had) for Arrow to hit Barry.  If you saw DoFP Quicksilver just tapped people at super speed for them to go flying, because speed Force equals Mass times Acceleration.     Can anyone explain why(in the story) Superman doesn't talk to Supergirl.     Ahh a fellow speedster, your smart, but your not that smart.     I am pretty sure she is only other hero besides Superman, because they haven't referenced the Justice League or any other characters. It also doesn't take place in the Flash/Arrow universe.     Pretty sure Superman is the only hero because Kara says ""There isn't just one hero anymore"".      I would say Flash. I like sci-fi powers and Earth 2 more than Oliver back on the island.     Good old ATBP. :D     Ya but that is time travel. They can both time travel.     It does take the doctor time to turn his dials and what not. It also takes a few seconds for the tardis to dissapear.     They did say everyone and everything would be destroyed in Goku and Beerus' attack, which includes them.     They explained that the shockwaves became more powerful the further away they went. It only knocked people down on earth soooooo... I don't know how that makes any sense.     How can physics be real if our eyes aren't real.     The ""angle of the punch"" excuse for why there are no longer shockwaves when they punch is still funny and makes no sense.  Like how would matching the angle of a punch cancel a universe busting attack.     I would also say Superman would win if he was bloodlusted.  Even with Goku's new universal feat he is slower and less durable(they said the shockwaves from their punches were the weakest at the point of origin).     That's about his only ""feat"". No new durability, speed, or reaction speed feats.     If there is no time travel shenanigans than I say Flash. IIRC he beat a teleporter in a race, but I don't know if he absorbed the speed from everyone on earth.     Ya that never happens. /s     In episode 12 many characters believe his clash with Beerus will destroy the universe. The shock waves from their clash destroy a planet pretty far away, but that is all the destruction adds up to before they stop the shock waves.  Goku vs. Superman  Since Goku has gotten more feats from Dragon Ball Super, how do you think he would fair against Post Crisis Superman?

Barry cought a bullet when his back was turned.  Using this theory then anyone should have been able to shoot Reverse Flash with a gun. And they could have just shot him in the legs.     Why not just say that Ray sent Barry the nanites, and then not include Oliver at all.  Ray doesn't ever seem to reference these nanites that can stop speedsters for multiple minutes. It just seems that they wanted Oliver to look cool while make everyone else look stupid.     ""NANITES COURTESY OF RAY PALMER. THEY'RE EMITTING A HIGH FREQUENCY PULSE THAT'S DISABLING YOUR SPEED.

It's just that some people believe that if it wasn't a remake of New Hope it wouldn't have made money.     Prove to moviegoers that they knew what star wars was all about, and that they could handle it well.

This is something many people have said as an excuse as to why FA had to be a remake of a New Hope.  

Tell a cohesive plot that succeeded in drawing in the audience

This is not something that can only be done by remaking a New Hope.  Even though the Prequels were panned, they were all box office successes.  All Force Awakens had to do was tell a good story and it would have made a ton at the box office. Just look at the success of Star Wars Battlefront, even though it was not reviewed well, it was still one of the best selling games of the year.  Star Wars Battlefront released before Force Awekens, which means that Disney didn't have to prove anything, and people would still eat it up because it was called ""Star Wars"".  Being a Saitama jerker is now considered a pre existing condition. #wanpunch       Podracers are my favorite sound in star wars.

That is if you are actually serious.     And yet people complain about the over saturation of comic book movies.     Recently saw this video.

This is basically just a repost of [this post](https://np.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/67uq9t/how_to_tell_when_it_isnt_actual_ingame_footage/).     In the r/movies poll it was number 3 for underated movies.     Ya I do prefer Titanfall 2 to Call of Duty, but the way jetpacks worked in Advanced Warfare is still my favorite.     I thought Infinite Warfare had the weakest gunplay, but I ear the story is good.     Cultural impact and quotability don't even make a movie good. Otherwise rediit is going to have to acknowledge that the prequels are some of the best movise of all time.     /uj If avatar bombed like people thought, reddit would call in an underated gem.     /uj I am actually sure that some of it was gameplay just with the HUD removed.

I know this is not very popular with reddit, but I felt that the jet packs and wall running were a natural progression for Call of Duty.  I had always played it for fast paced smooth combat and wall running added to that.

/rj Stop making the same game every year and go back to making the same games you used to make every year.....but all CODs are the same   Pricing of Nintendo games  Nintendo games have always been more expensive than games on other consoles. Take for example the prices of Skyrim($5) and Skyward Sword($35) or Ocarina of Time 3DS($42) and Uncharted 3($5) on Amazon. Do you guys think that Nintendo is charging to much for their games.     But how much better reviewed. Are you talking like a 1/10 to a 10/10 or are you talking about a 9.5/10 to a 10/10.     I just used Skyrim as a point because it was a game held in high regard. Plenty of others were released around the same time with similar reviews. I guess you don't see it like I do, so we can agree to disagree.     That is because Nintendo rarely drops the prices of new games and they don't print very many games to make the used prices more expensive. They are more expensive because Nintendo keeps the prices high and if you own a Nintendo console you have to buy Nintendo games(monopoly) because if you don't you will have nothing to play, which was OPs original point, that the games are more expensive than games on other consoles. You may think skyrim wasn't as good as Nintendo games(subjective) but the reviews and Game of the Year awards speak differently(objective).     Again completely subjective. If you like Nintendo games as well as highly rated games on other consoles, Nintendo games are almost always more expensive even when compared to Game of the year winning games. Check out the prices of zelda, pikmin, donkey kong, mario and compare them to non Nintendo highly rated games and you will see the huge disparity(compare gears of war 1, oblivion, and twilight princess all released in 2006). OP was making the point that Nintendo games have bad prices compared with other games of equal quality. Your original comment was asking a question to the OP, hopefully you can see his(and my) point.     Actually Skyrim won more Game of the Year awards than Skyward Sword or OOT 3DS, and it is a much bigger game than either of those.  The point OP was trying to make is that $20 isn't that great of a price for such old games. Check out this site for how long it normally takes to complete Skyrim, OOT, and Skyward Sword. [http://howlongtobeat.com/](http://howlongtobeat.com/)     Completely subjective. If I like both Skyrim and OOT I am not going to wait 5 years for the price to drop to $20.     That is the point OP made. If you like Nintendo games and other games(xbox, ps, pc) then this doesn't seem like much of a deal when these type of people wait 1-2 years to get good games 60-80% off while games like OOT after 5 years are only 50% off the original price. He is saying that these games cost much more than games of equal(if not better) quality that came out the same year.     But almost all good games(excluding Nintendo games) drop in price fairly quickly(1-2 years under $20) while Nintendo games(such as Skyward Sword) stay at a high price for many years.     But the Original Post was talking about good games going cheaper than $20, and saying that these prices aren't good for games
 released 5-10 years ago

     You said,

 Nintendo should drop their prices lower just because bad third party PS3 games have dropped to $10 or less?

And I showed that their were very good games released the same year that costed $60 on release(OOT 3ds costed $40).     Those don't seem like bad third party games to me, and they have been cheaper than $20.     But, Dark Souls, Arkham City, Portal 2, and Skyrim were released the same year that OOT 3ds came out.     Yes, because any game that is not a Nintendo game is automatically bad. All of those cheap Sony Game of the Years.^/s     The fanwank is strong with this one     Triggered     What game is this?     Why is there a picture of Pete's Dragon?     nope     Ya, Goku is becoming a parody of himself.  He is acting more like a dumb child who only cares about fighting.     Goku is on Beerus' team, which means if Goku wins Earth will be destroyed.       Goku is so stupid in Dragon Ball Super, he can't even count to 12.   In the latest episode Beerus said he would wish for the annihilation of the earth if his team won the tournament, and Goku said he didn't care.

Do people still play it, is it worth [$1](http://store.steampowered.com/sub/30564/) more for the expansion, and does it have good replay value.     Dude Superman can shoot ice out of his mouth because of the sun. :I     So unrealistic, unlike when Superman breaks all physics because of the ""SunForce"".      It's true....all of it.

It is strange because I no longer have access to online. I looked everywhere to see if it was maybe a free weekend of some sort, but I guess not.  I had it for like an hour went to bed and when I woke up it was gone. \\\_()_/     Good luck  Strange free Xbox live  On 5/13/2016 at 2 am I was able to play online as if I had Xbox live gold, with any account that had Xbox live silver.  I was playing a few hours before on Dark Souls and it had to start in offline mode, but at 2 am it started in online mode. Currently at 12 pm I can no longer play online. Does anyone know what this was?     I have a deck, and was looking for places to buy/play.     I will try that     Idk my 360 has been running well with every other game and I have more than enough space for the install, doesn't seem to be overheating either(I have the slim). Might be a sign to upgrade to next gen once the PS4 neo and the Xbox One slim come out.     Actually I am just borrowing the game to see if I want to buy it. I was wondering if it was the game just being glitchy and a bad port or if it was my 360. I will try reinstalling and cleaning it out.

EDIT: Reinstalled and cleaned out the dust and the cutscene ran better but still lagged a ton. Oh well  Does anyone know why this glitch is caused or if it is fixable. Xbox 360 (Not my video but same problem)       What sites do you use to buy online?     I read some yelp reviews about ""All About Games"" that were saying some pretty bad things about it.  Do you think its a good place to play and buy?  Yu-Gi-Oh in Boise area  Does anyone know of a good place to play and buy Yu Gi Oh in the Boise area?     Good point,but I just think the show has very inconsistent rules of time travel.      Rip is trying to stop Vandal Savage before he takes over the world, if he succeeds he wouldn't have a reason to go back in time an stop him. Paradox. Kronos(aka Mick) shot down the time ship containing Mick which made it crash in 2046 Star City. Paradox.  In 2046 Mick wants to stay but Snart knocks him out which leads to their split and Mick becoming Kronos. Paradox     It is a paradox. Kronos created himself. In the next episode Rip wants to kill a boy who will basically be the next Hitler. So explain to me why Rip can go back in time to kill ""future Hitler""(which will change his own timeline immensely) why couldn't they go back and pick up Ray, Kendra, and Sarah?      All of it altered the past because there had to be one timeline in which Kronos didn't fight them so that they didn't crash. Just as there are timelines in which Star is destroyed in 2046 and one where Ray, Sarah, and Kendra didn't get stranded.

EDIT: plus Rip is altering his own timeline in every episode.     Are you kidding me he changed tons of stuff, he shot them down twice. One of which is what led to Mick being betrayed by Snart in the first place.     Heatwave shot at himself \_()_/  [Xbox 360] Looking for Experienced players to do VOG  First time vault of glass raider. Looking for help.

Gamertag: SavedFlipper0     Probably not. The show is really cliche and isn't original in the slightest. Not to mention all of the love triangles.     Wrong clip     It isn't because of training.  He most certainly has to let the attacks hit him at the speed he can perceive time.     I actually traded in 4 DS games to get an Xbox 360 for $15. I like Nintendo games, don't get me wrong, but I feel that if I can get a better game at an equal or lesser price I won't buy another Nintendo game. To each their own I guess.     Well I guess that is fine, I just don't like how Nintendo has their games prices go up past the original price instead of down. It has really turned me off of buying Nintendo games because there is no decent time to buy(my personal opinion).     Then let me compare Batman Arkham City to Skyward Sword. Batman Arkham City has a 95.94% and Skyward Sword has a 93.15%. Does THIS mean that Batman Arkham City should cost $30 more than Skyward Sword because it has a 2.79% higher rating than Skyward Sword?     That is what I am saying. Let's say there is someone who likes Uncharted as much as you like Pokemon(they both are very highly rated games). The person who likes Uncharted can get the game for $5 or less, the person who likes Pokemon will have to pay 8 times that amount for a game of equal quality(objectively). Do you think that Nintendo games are over priced?

EDIT: also not saying it is stupid to buy Soul Silver for $40 because that is how much I paid for it.     Let us go back to Skyrim and Ocarina of Time 3DS. On Gamerankings Skyrim has a 95.15%, OOT 3DS has 93.89%. Does this mean that Skyrim should cost $30 more than OOT 3DS because it is 1.26% higher rated?     Yes but if you could only get Naughty dog games on the PS3 and uncharted cost 40 dollars because Sony stop printing them it would be considered a classic.     Do you as the consumer want to pay more money for a Nintendo game then for any other game released by another company.     Is it a classic because it is a good game or because it is hard to find at a cheap price.     But do you think that those games are worth the price when you could get 8 other amazing games for the price of one Nintendo game?     What modern Nintendo games are you talking about specifically?     That is what I am talking about, at other companies when the game sales start to fall they lower the price of the game, but when this happens to Nintendo they stop production. Nintendo is also known for creating artificial scarcity to drive up the price of used games.     Huh?   Does voucher in Metal Gear Solid Legacy Collection expire?  I was wondering if the code for the first MGS and the VR missions expire like some of the other sony codes.     Hope I can win.     But what about the insanely expensive memory cards on vita?
  PSP worth getting if you have a vita.  I was wondering if a PSP is worth getting if you already own a vita. One of the reasons is that a PSP's memory cards are much cheaper and it can also play UMD only games like Birth by Sleep.  Should I give two weeks notice for a Burger King Job I started a little over a month ago?    Do you still need an online pass for Little Big Planet Vita?

Bought a Ps Vita and I am looking into cases under $20  Just purchased a Ps Vita and I was wondering what is a good case for storing the Ps Vita and some games.

     Thanks for letting me know. If the WiiU games end up anything like some of the gamecube games, then I am probably never buying a WiiU.  WiiU price question  Seeing how the Xbox One just dropped to $250, do you think that the WiiU will have a price drop.     What is this from?     I have checked on different TVs, HDMI cords, and have hard reset the console, but it didn't solve it.  [Tech] Block black textures in the menus. Have any of you had this problem.       I did a hard reset and nothing changed     Another picture [http://imgur.com/a/WHYCk](http://imgur.com/a/WHYCk)  Have any of you experienced this problem where a blocky black texture appears in the menues?    [Tech] Xbox Visual Glitches  Xbox has glitched numbers and letters with black boxes sometimes appearing around them. Does anyone else have the same problems, and if so do you know how to fix it?     Thanks dude just bought it off CD keys for $8, but both my brothers got it when they bought there Xboxs. Excited to finally play Halo 2 multiplayer.  Transferring games between two Xboxs.  If my brother has Halo MCC can I transfer the game to my Xbox one instead of having to wait for the download. PS I own the game on my account as well I just don't want to download 60gb.     Thanks for reminding me about Destiny.     Yeah probably gonna get the halo games and then infinite warfare.     What would you say your favorite Xbox One game is?     What did you think of Sunset Overdrive?     You think Black Ops 3 is worth it with Infinite Warfare coming soon.     Probably Halo, but I don't really know what other people consider to be the best.  New to Xbox One  Just ordered an Xbox One and it should be her in a few days, but I am looking for some good game to play.     There's always a bigger fish.     Yo where did you learn to draw like this?     What is the song?     Thanks for the reply.     Have you taken any classes?     Where did you learn to draw like this?     Seems like people get seriously mad about the ""political thriller"" jerk instead of just making fun of it. idk just my thoughts on the matter     But, is slamming the jerk about ""political thrillers"" a jerk of its own?     Ok, but there are still skill based games like CSGO to play in the meantime.     So you are complaining that a company is making what ""millions of people"" want and not just what you want to play.   Are these controllers the official microsoft controllers, because it says ""Item pictured may not be exact item received""?       Gears of War 3 please.     Do you think buying a copy of the base Super Street Fighter 4 for $2 and then upgrading for another $6 to ultra would be a good deal?  Which game would you guys choose to get, SF3 online or Street Fighter x Tekken?  Thinking about getting one, but don't know if anyone is still playing these. Console is 360  Anyone still play Street Fighter 3 or Street Fighter x Tekken?  Games are on sale right now, just wondering if anyone still plays them.  Do people still play this on Xbox 360, and if so how long does it take to find a match?    How to make address show up as a blue circle?       How many triple A games do you have installed?     What is a good price for a 4tb?     Are they triple A titles?  What size storage do you guys use?  How much space do you guys have and what type of hard drive is it? Also how many games do you buy/have installed at a single time?

Edit: I was thinking about getting [this](https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Backup-Portable-External-STDR2000103/dp/B00FRHTTJE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8) 2tb or [this](https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Expansion-Portable-External-STEA4000400/dp/B017KE8OG0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8) 4tb, what do you guys think?     I figured it out, I just have a 7 day trial for Xbox live Gold. This means I don't get access to the free games or cloud storage.     I think it was the first multi-disc game to go backwards compatible.     I do believe that the Directors Cut is backwards compatible. And I got the regular version for $4.50.   Just purchased Deus Ex Human Revolution for Xbox 360, but then I learned about the directors cut.  Should I just keep it, or take it back and wait until I can find the directors cut version.  Can't select the Cloud when moving saved games.  When I try to move saved games I just have the option to transfer to my internal storage. I have Xbox live Gold and I have cloud saves enabled.     Ending doesn't make that much sense though, and after trying to beat the game on the hardest difficulty and getting that kind of an ending, kinda makes me hate the game.  Upgrading from 360 to Xbox one.  I only own the dlc for destiny on 360, but I don't have the base game( I have it physically). Does the upgrade still work?     Cool, been wanting to pick up some Vita games.     I liked it, but I don't think I enjoyed it as much as I could because I played on Hard.  Restart God of War Ascension or just try to replay chapters on Hard?  Just beat God of War Ascension on Hard but missed the a couple of trophies(upgrading all items by 1500 orbs and missing last artifact after trial of archimedes).  Anyone selling a PSP?  Looking for a PSP preferably 2000 or 3000, and without custom firmware.     Where would I be able to buy these?  Would a 400 card box be worth getting for $20?  Don't know cards inside will check tomorrow.  The King Has Returned    Worth it to replace a screen or just get a new one.  Just bought a PSP 3000 for $43 dollars and the screen has a black splotch in it. Should I go buy a new screen and fix it, or return it for a full refund and get one from my local game store for $60?

I will probably just buy it if I like Patapon 1 and 2     Thanks for the info didn't even check there. Also should I buy Patapon 3 for 15 on psn or get psplus.  Does the Patapon 2 voucher expire?  It is $5 from Amazon.     I am US located     You selling any of them?     I just don't like custom firmware, I am trying to play just the console and no custom firmware and no roms.  Best Memory micro sd and adapter for PSP 3000 no hacking or unofficial firmware?  Looking for around 64Gb plus storage.     I meant GB  Would these a 128 memory card work in a PSP 3000?

Would $43 be a good price for a 3000 with original box and power cable?  Price of a PSP 3000 or 2000 in 2016  What is the price you guys paid for your PSP in 2016, and what price do you think is a good deal?     sweet, been thinking about getting this from Walmart.com and playing the first metal gear solid on psp   ""Just Master Race Things""-Geralt       For me it seems to much like unnecessary fan-service.  There is always a very contrived reason to bring on Oliver in the crossover, and it doesn't seem like this episode has anything to do with the main stories of any of the shows.  I can't access my PowerUpRewards. It says ""Sorry, we couldn't validate your information. Please try again.""

Recently Gamestop raised the price of Resistance 3 from $3 to $10 and I was wondering what you guys think I should do?  My local pawn shop has really good deals on games, but I haven't seen a copy of Resistance 3 there for over a year.  I was wondering if I should just spring for it on ebay, buy the collection(brother has 1 and 2 but I may want to have my own copy), buy it from gamestop when they have buy 2 get 1 free, or wait for my pawn shop to get it?

Do you guys know how much it normally goes for on sale, and how often? Thanks      Same, I was playing mass effect and then the next day I couldn't update my dishonored.     Thanks man I have had to do the exact same thing when my games update.  I also checked my brothers xbox and his is having the same problem, so it must be server side.  The Persona games are on sale and I was wondering if I should get Persona 3 and 4 or wait for a possible portable version sale next week(3 for psp and 4 for Vita)?

Not sure, i shipped the whole haul which cost 650y about 70 the hat on its own will cost you 22 to ship with ems because its the standard price for anything upto 1kg     Not an issue, they style is what i like :)     It's cool i'll still wear them they look dope     The only packaging they updated was the LV 

Edit: they send you a ribbon too     I'm in the UK     Do they ship to U.K.?     What you gonna put them on?     Idk bro they're only socks :)     They're a only one batch and they're not great unfortunately I GP'd in my first review check them out     Gotchu soon as it come thru     six pairs     all my EMS parcels came into superbuy in 2days, 3 at most. 4 days with ems to my door. = 6-7 days.     Yeah course they do, its not a thing man clothes are clothes. At the end of the day i still buy retail things too so, i'm good with that.      Thank you, all my mates call me French Montana because of the clothes I wear     https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=542584915681     https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=542584915681     Work hard play hard I think the saying goes     UK bro     Aimepan it says in the title     It's very used, comes with scratches     Use superbuy   EMS you will get it to your door in 8     No problem      Yeah I was the same, criminal record = no visa      No, I did air conditioning and refrigeration for 4 years and then I ended up getting laid off and stumbled upon a chef apprenticeship and the rest is history     It's probably PU but is Lv real leather? Nope     I'm not sure I'm gonna cop this when I'm back off holiday though, next months haul will be pure GP's!     You sure? I'm bout to cop up everything on that store fr lmao     Nah sorry     U too b     No idea what it's supposed to look like I'm new to Givenchy only ever owned a Rottweiler tee so hopefully someone else can answer     Nothing wrong with BALR I like the brand, don't know why it gets so much hate.     Ah I like it though it looks cool, 99.9% of people wouldn't LC a tee anyway that's ridiculous, but hey if I do get called out I know it's someone from this sub     Bruh     Thank you, open to suggestions so if you want to message me with what your interested in when I make another I'll take it into consideration. I'm only using things I like at the minute!     You didn't have to come up in here, where's your list? Oh yeah you can't even find your feet never mind a good rep     The one with the pattern collar? Looks dope GL     You should look at Tarmac in Australia, pays very well. One of my friends went out for 3 years and bought a house outright when he got back     I'm only a chef, nothing major. My only outgoings are about 700 a month most months I take home between 2000-2500 depending what hours I work. But it's definitely not easy money, it pays well because it's hard.     Size 8 they TTS     Damn, good luck... don't flex it too much you might get LC'd lool     A1 sauce, cop     yo bro, did you get the hoodie yet? Not heard from you     Fake, he took a big L
thats an awful fake too     word, they killin it right now for me     Yeah i bought a rep hoodie but ended up selling it as it didnt fit properly!
PS Don't be jealous just save up :)     Be careful bro, I like to spend alot...... No problem bro enjoy!     It was a FW piece, they've updated to SS now i think  FINDS LIST PART 2, BIGGER   BETTER!  Back at it again with some bank account breaking finds!
Because the last one did so well, enjoy this one too!

Enjoy!     They're retails, definitely b s but these are fire I'll look for them     Not sure as retail is 90 they are 40     Fake, the text is a dead giveaway. Also no drop stitches on the button holes     f knows, i just found retails in my size for 160 so im just gonna cop those     Gucci 1/2 price of retail https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a230r.1.999.85.nxdiYr id=547600221978 ns=1#detail

I just add a note to my agent with my measurements and ask them to tell the seller to pick the right size, works every time     Same here  Would anyone like to swap my 24k Apple Watch for a backpack?       Are they preorders?     Yeah     Paris tee is close .9:1 but the rest is 1:1     Yes I use superbuy      Fake     Thank you      Wait is it even based on a real piece?

If you had looked you would of found this 1:1 ferragamo  LPT Always open tinned food upside down, this makes the contents come out so much easier so you don't have to scrape or shake the tin!  [removed]     Awful quality, Thom Browne polos retail 200-500. For this kind of price you know materials and quality are going to be the best and for 75rmb you will get nothing even close to authentics just bear it in mind before asking for QCs      Yes pirits are probably the best for the price but I don't think they're raw denim     I'm no expert in the Gucci aces but for 100rmb these will not be anything special     I want retail but seem to be sold out     Try /r/RawDenim 
Or Piritpowers Amiri jeans     Try /r/RawDenim     Every time I see these I think of fettywap 1738 yeah baby     Search bar      My previous post with Tao stores has a Goyard store which may carry this     Because on both brands the tags are sewn on with one thread each side. I have a few authentics where the tag hangs on one side. I've now learnt to hand wash as much as possible.     Arenas run a size bigger if anything like retails     Thanks bro!     I bought runners and sped trainers both TTS     Definitely authentic     No problem hope it helps!     Which ones?     Just compare the photos of the retails someone posted     I think i would probably use it as a bag tag instead of a keychain      It's really not hard to find, try using the search bar to start with      Couldn't have said that better myself     It is retail   My Authentic LV wallet to help you QC        Get more photos yeah, one of the back of the buckle   one that shows how many holes there are     Bro the GG pattern isn't aligned centrally and the stitching on the leather is dreadful.

Sorted thanks for the help bro!     Wechat - kt6732 is one     I just copped my usual 30w but i will let you know when they arrive!     328y? wechat sellers are selling for 250y     Can you send fit pic?     On what?     eBay      yeah seems theyre all 250yuan     Okay cool thanks for the info man! Is that also how i get into my account? i've been locked out for hours!     Did you cop?     https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a230r.1.999.51.KtjUUC id=546239264047 ns=1#detail here we go     100 ono     +1 Thanks man      i did but it translated it something to do with envelopes     Can't see any from pics, the wash looks good so i would say 1:1     Pretty sure its a discount for 10yuan, can i use this on superbuy or not?  Can anyone translate this?       3k can get a preowned authentic, your asking $800 for a used rep? Better be able to walk into hermes with it and not get called out     for real i could rock the shit outta this\
     Done, my bad     no problem man, just repaying to the community     probably tuesday when everything comes in to warehouse     250rmb     2 days max     yeah i copped from slamxhype on wechat     I think they are 1:1      Maybe then but that print looks wierd     Im only size 8 lol     Who uses dust bags? I dont even put my shoes in dustbags F thaat     Thats a bad version, Maybe womens because of the sizing i would need a XXL      Yeah for sure, i'll review every item!     Literally nothing      Until you buy one and receive QC pics you won't know exactly how your bag will look. It could have one flaw on the stock photo but a different one on the one you buy      Think of them like them wedding shoes with the points, that part isn't for your toes lmao     Added alternate lnks fam     zippers on pockets feel cheap, waistband string pertty bad. without comparing to retails in hand i culdn't tell you anything else sorry     Nah not 2, you got to remember these arent your typical shaped shoe they are pointed at the front. Just one size unless you want your toes to hurt     I have alternate links bear with me buddy     Maybe you will get me into SLP too I love all the stuff Gucci is bringing out now though especially those graffiti jeans!      More, probably better to come     Exactly the same     Lol please leave it out yh     NO thats a con, super perfect are the ones they've already produced. The made to order ones are just the newest releases that they haven't mass produced.     PKZ have they're own factory, the factory only makes Louboutins though. Everything else is overpriced tao shit     No offence taken. I just wanted to elaborate on your comment :)     they aren't 1:1 but im only using them around the house anyway so i'm not really worried about them. They comfy as uck though man you don't understand, I've had retail versace ones for over a year now and the sole is pretty hard and uncomfy now so glad I got these!!     Compared to my retails the only flaws are, grip on the bottom pattern is different, and the logo on the insole isn't clear like retails but the text on the midsole is deffo on point these are crazy i will do a comparison on both and upload pics.     No problem man glad to help you all!     Yeah this store is shit man i ordered a pair of the 3m high tops and if you think superbuys QC photos are shit you should see the state of the shoes they send me, there was no shape to them the back was flat the sole wasn't glossy, there was no padding on the logo, the stitches pointed to the 5th spike when it should be the 3rd spike on the toe box. If you wear these shoes your gonna look like a nonce in 1:1 gucci but 0.2:1 Loubs. Pay the premium and buy from PKZ its worth it, they do have some minor flaws but at least the shape is good, the sole is glossy, the logo is padded, the spikes are aligned perfectly   the materials are good. I always buy my shoes from PKZ except i bought runners from slamxhype. People moan about the price but the materials are on point man and its still 1/4 of retail.       Also interested!!     oh shit i need them 222222 
come on rep gods find them :)     Hater  [REVIEW] 1000 Haul Parcel no.1                                      **WELCOME!**

* **Gucci Vintage Hoodie, Price 390y, [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=548336569442), [Alternate](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z10.3-c-s.w4002-16145190987.39.FsWf6m id=548280761361)** *Overall GREAT quality, not too heavy   not light. Print is good, Hardware is good   the tags are good except stitching on the tag should be red and its black. Worth the money? Hell yeah I can see this being one of those hoodies you can't bring yourself to get rid of in 3 years time!! How does it fit? I ordered a L thinking it would be TTS but it runs a little smaller, however i kinda like how it fits but i will probably size up next time.*

* **Gucci Vintage Tee, Price 290y, [W2C](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=548337789426), [Alternate](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z10.3-c.w4002-16255786177.50.pQ0Zof id=549000848953)** *I think this is the most 1:1 of this tshirt, it's thin as fuck and the stitching on the tags is red! The only fault I can pick is the green on the belt isn't properly distressed. How does it fit? This tee runs TTS if you like a snug fit I would recommend sizing down as its quite baggy!*

subject3504,"    This girl sounds awesome.  My first girlfriend.  Soooo I just acquired a girlfriend. MY FIRST and she means the world to me. I met her parents and sister already and they like me a lot. (From what she told me) she makes me smile 24/7.  She's smart, witty and charming. And so fucking cute. I really dont want to mess this up. She makes me so nervous! Ive never felt like this about anyone ever. I have no idea what I'm doing.     So cute :)  No pictures!       Second grade little girl. I have to pee like hell. And I raise my hand like a good child. So the bitch teacher, instead of letting me go right away makes me stand next to her till she's done talking. I stand there fidgeting with my dress straps while she's chatting away. Somehow, God knows why, I manage to loosen the straps just enough to fall off my shoulders. Thus causing my dress to fall down to my ankles in front of the whole class. I never moved so quickly. I bent down so fast and picked up my dress I'm not sure you would have seen me move. But I'm sure the whole class did.   I always thought marijuana made you lethargic, I guess I was wrong.        Lucky Boy. 

Get everything.   I guess I'll just go back the way I came..       Where are you located?     Yep. Almost barfed.      And Roald Dahl     Anne Sexton-The Book of Folly
Maya Angelou-Alone     And grew out   These lovely ladies got a Star today.    Radiohead-Body snatchers       Congrats :)

I was a bit weary upon meeting my girls parents too. Luckily for me they loved me and I charmed with my awesomeness. Plus my gf's mom is bi (or gay?)      I'm not a failure. I have a good life now.     Why he no finish second half?     I was walking with a buddy back in highschool and it was the last period of the day and we were late but didn't really give a shit. And I forget what my friend said, but I turned to look at them and I shouted "" you are retarded!"" I saw the horror on my friends face. I looked to my left and the WHOLE special ed. class was walking by. All fucks given     Oh Jesus take me now I laughed at that. Hard  Where's all the foods?       The scene from The Fifth Element when LeeLoo is learning about earths history. She comes across war and sheds that single tear...gets me every time.      I said my goodbyes and I just packed my stuff and left     As a vegetarian I just shop at trader joes, normal there.      I saw this. And my whole neighborhood was in awe. Then we all cheered. I was near JPL.      I wear glasses, and at the time of Akeelah and the Bee's release, I had the same style of glasses as her. (Not to mention awkward similar resemblance) so for like a year I was called Akeelah and the Bee. 


I was a great speller.      I am christian and I was openly friends with a satanist.

no fucks given.

religion doesnt always have to be a deal breaker.     Stairs?     Fellow Pasadenan!     Pasadena, California  raping himself rage       Hmm I can agree on that. Like I can feel it coming on and instead of immediately trying to get out I let it happen to see if I hallucinate or not.       Like you enjoy the experience itself?     You enjoy the thrill?     I always try to move but it takes a few seconds. After I focus on moving like my shoulder for instance. It'll move after a while but in a jerking movement. Then the rest of the feeling slowly come back.     I'm sorry man/girl? It happened a lot when I was in school too trying to put my head down so even though my eyes were open I didn't see much. Sometimes I can get out of it, can you?     I'd love to provide proof, but its not something that happens on call. Its completely random.      Once I was just laying on the bed with a pal laying in front of me on her lap top and then I felt kinda tired and knew it was coming but I tried to nap anyways. And then it hit me and my breathing was loud as shit and she was sitting up. When it was over she was immediately laying down again. She heard nothing and never moved or sat up at all. Complete hallucination.      I laughed a good laugh. Thank you.      Why did Cinderella get kicked off of the soccer team?


She ran away from the ball.     Dishwasher 

1-2 years restaurant experience      Rocket boots      Lol no, I went last night on a group date.      starch or press     I consider my ""step"" mother my real mother for the first time growing up I felt what it was like to have a loving mother, and what it was like to be someone's daughter. Amazing.     I played Fable and spent time making men and women fall in love with me, marrying everyone and kicking chickens.     Canadian      18  My girlfriend is keeping me a secret from a part of her family. She hasnt told me all of the story yet. What should I do?  Back story: i asked her to confirm us as a couple on Facebook, and she told me she couldnt. I asked her why and she explained to me that a part of her religious family needs to be okay with it first. But i feel that there is more to the story and that she is ashamed of me. I have tattoos and her family is more conservative than most.     When I was in the seventh grade, a fat girl with a glass eye, tried to convince everyone she had a boyfriend...


...in Japan.      And take your sister.      Leave right away. Don't wait for something bad to happen.      By that standard, Loki is also a beautiful woman.      Hey, she's smart. At least she's taking into account everything she swallows. :)     ""...what's...p-poking me?""     Build a case against her. When she hits you guys, each of you write about the individual accounts and if you witnessed the others. If there is visible damage take photos. Even when she verbally abuses you guys. Write all of that down. Then. WALK THE FUCK OUT.
My biological mother was the same. Abusive, verbally as well. A total alcoholic maniac. Oh you just got $20? Congrats on buying alcohol and cigarettes. And her boyfriend abused the both of us. The look on her face when she said the police had arrived was priceless. Of course her boyfriend tried to hide and was found. The last thing I seen on my mother was the back of her head. That was 14 months ago. I'm free as a bird.      http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPZPxGoNnn0 feature=youtube_gdata_player     Your father bought shirts that made you look sexier because he knew you were a Redditor...

On the sidewalk. 

*how its actually spelled.      Teachers     Only the extremist Muslims are violent. Hence ""extremist"". But there are extremists in every religion. I'm pretty sure they understand the quran. Maybe they just twist their bad deeds into being good deeds for God.      Don't believe that shit. My aunt doesn't wear the hijab normally, only to pray and at the masjid. She's a damn good Muslim. And a REAL ONE. I'm not Muslim, but the religion interests me so I'm doing Ramadan this year. I wore the hijab to pray and at the masjid. Its just respectful to wear it at those times. For God.      Haha I'm doing Ramadan as a choice because part of my fathers family are Muslims. I live with moms family. Its hard in the beginning O.o

On Reddit sir      I'm doing Ramadan.

Family wants to go to chipotle.

Well fuck.  The troubles of a Redditor..       Narnia, bikini bottom or Saudi Arabia..     No, there is no other animal in the mirror.      ""Its okay cause we're best friends!""

Rum, Reddit, and taco bell. 
NIGHT. COMPLETE     This why I don't babysit     Pollination at its best.      American: UKs carbonated lemonade     The hot lesbian thing was okay. It just that he thought being gay was wrong, yet he went on a gay fb page looking for gay people.  What's the dumbest thing anyone has ever said to you in a conversation?  So I went on a Facebook LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bi, Transgender) page and posted about a recent scenario involving my seven and four year old cousins. Basically, I was trying to teach them about tolerance and respect toward Gay people. Then some guy comments as follows:

Ignorant Guy: you are teaching them to be gay.

Me: noo, gay can't be taught, but tolerance and respect can.

IG: actually you are teaching them to be gay. So stop it, being gay is wrong.

Me: then why are you on a LGBT page

IG: looking up hot lesbians, how 'bout you?

What was the dumbest thing you have ever heard in a conversation that resulted in mental face palm?      It's also interesting to see them eat tacos at all. I legitimately had no idea they loved tacos like us. Damn, I loves tacos.  Interesting...       The Greeks are gonna get weird     Lil Mama     I think the computer hacker stopping the threat counts.     Were talking to you Michael Bay.     R/funnyandsad     Aaron Taylor-Johnsons wife is way older than him. Strapped him fully with kids too. He was 21 so nothing illegal. But love is love I guess.     The medium salsa ""Woooooo there buddy!""     Bones ft. Snoop Dogg and Candy Man. NOPE.     Someone ringing the doorbell.     I wish I remembered to ask what the micron size. I never do and Now I feel like I fucked myself lol     I wish I remembered to ask what the micron size. I never do and Now I feel like I fucked myself lol     Hey try the coin, just not with bud inside. I
Step 1. Grind weed regularly, then remove.
Step 2. Add coin into now empty chamber.
Step 3. Freeze for a bit then shake to death.
Step 4. Reap rewards then place weed back in chamber.
Step 5. [1000}     Seriously why is he not in jail!      But holy crap, did he do well. When I saw it before I legitimately thought the actor was actually skilled in doing this. Like he said he guys I have a random skill type of thing. Now I wonder how long this took to learn lol     True! But for #1. I never have bud in the chamber for that exact reason. I ended up with powder bud that partially got into the kief. So that sucked, and never did that again lol     I actually combine the two. I put my grinder in the freezer for 15 mins then I knock it around with the coin inside!      The pain they've caused will always be there. The ""forgive   forget"" mentality never works. It's toxic. I haven't spoken to my birth mother in 6 years. She wants to talk to me, but I won't give her the benefit of the doubt.     Exactly. I feel so bad for celebrities for that reason. It obviously got so bad he had to tell people to give him personal space at his own personal space. Oh well. I wouldn't apologize either.      It's weirdly personal to me. When I was a kid I tried to ask my gma how much she made and said it was rude to ask such a question and that that was personal. So now when people talk about their money, I feel like they are releasing sensitive info.      Haha I'm not. There was a post on r/relationships that talked about a guys gf learning he had cash and started dropping hints like this.     This explains what I'm trying to say much better! I think finances should stay in the home. You never know who wants to try and make a gain.     Love that movie. Love their confused ass reaction lol     Thai tea, water and a creamer. It is traditionally served with creamer like half and half. On it's own it's very sweet (probably where the cream comes in). I like to add a bit of my own creamer if any. It's so good on it's on with extra ice. Go to a thai market they'll hook you up.

Edit: [Here is the Tea](http://imgur.com/HQ7x2nK)
[Inside the bag](http://imgur.com/zflG1BB)   DAE think sharing personal finances is taboo?  My roommate is getting a small inheritance and is telling everyone. Even the day it will arrive in the mail!      Im a vegetarian, too! My so went to a party in Ohio and they were serving that. She noped to that but her friend ate it mistaking it for beef lol I'm Californian so that was strange hearing that. Interesting to hear this is so common, though.      Were they rude every time you went? I was ""in France"" In Epcot, Disney world when I had one of my rude interactions. I said Au Revoir to two workers who then proceeded to mock and laugh at me. I would never go to another country and be rude. I don't get it. We just keep running into the assholes, dude. What was the most friendly country?What is a typical New Zealander demeanor?

""HELLO SIR! WOULD YOU LIKE TO TALK ABOUT OUR LORD AND SAVIOR THE ALL BLACKS!""     Dude what is up with deer chili?     Have*     Eating popsicles in the shower. So hot. So cold.       What state do you hail from?      I'm from the west coast. That probably explains why I cane never heard of this growing up. Hmm. I've never eaten sweet potato fries sweet. I have eaten them savory with regular French fry dips.      This so damn good      I'm not sure exactly. It seems some people are answering here. The sweet potato marshmallows thing is new to me. It sounds really awful haha now sweet Potato fries are my jam!     We absolutely hate them, too. I just try to hang a jacket or bag to cover myself. I can't be the only American that gets excited over stalls that have full blown doors.  My thai tea sans creamer!       Just apart of regular terminology. I was watching a British show and for the life of me couldn't figure out what a frock or a fringe. Like bathroom here, loo there.      Just the word we grew up with. When asking someone where one is, we actually call it a bathroom. Restroom sounds more formal in my head. Some countries just plain call it the toilet. That is totally weird to say here.      I WAS A FREAKING LION ANIMORPH. ME AND AND MY WHOLE CREW WALKING AROUND TOWN AS ANIMALS HELL YEAH.     This is very true! This ideal is skewed depending on your region as well.      Sometimes we can be very overly patriotic or nationalistic. Only a small number of people are like this, though. ""AMERICA THE GREAT!"" Type ideal. It's pretty bizarre to a lot of us too. Any examples?     We also like crackers with chili! We like to dip the cracker. Very delicious!     I hope I get a lot of honest questions!     There is a Hot German post up just like this, word for word! Check it out! I was inspired by the super interesting questions there and wanted to do this post!   Non-American Redditors, what are some things about our culture that you would like to be explained to you?       I've heard from non-French Europeans that the French were rude. I've had pretty negative interactions with The French as well. I don't believe all french are like that but damn I am running into a lot of assholes.     I've heard that, actually. A YouTuber I follow loves it.      It's sounds like she developed FOMO and is wondering why you never coughed it up before? ""why don't we do this (since you've had money)?"" ""Why haven't we gone here (since you've had money)?"" If you like to stay frugal, tell her so. Also, make sure the people you have told aren't telling anyone else.     They cancelled because the creative people went to make regular show. (Secretly never watched the show for that reason), petty I know.  Of course I'm probably wrong though lol      He's such a nice guy. Who would even say anything?     Haha I call it kief Lasagna      I've always thought this idea was looked down upon. I think fake meats should be weaning foods for people who switch from omnivore to vegetarian. But living off if them? Too processed for me. I eat it once in a blue moon but thats it.      SAVE THE TEXT MESSAGES      It's okay I am used to it. People don't phase me as much anymore. If you don't love them. Fuck them. Kiss that plane ticket for us!     Idk why people think a vegan diet is fatal. Like bitch it's food?     I'm sorry to hear this. My family is Muslim and they accept me. (They are from America) I'm sorry you can't practice. A'Salamu A'Laikum anyways. Seriously. One thing I took to HEART is that family will always love you even of you have to cut them off or they cut you off. (To live openly you might have to. Super sorry again.) I always tell myself that if a family member decided to never speak to me again, I KNOW they'll love me for life. Your own happiness is all you have, Honey. So I was out and was like any questions? I am of a minority race and people give my folks shit all the time. I can't me being gay even be a problem on top. I am out. I am a gayby. It's probably hard now and maybe years away. But I swear when you have YOU back, your heart will be so damn light. Damn. I wish you had the means right now. Yes. I understand appeasing family. Just remember NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO OR WHO YOU DO IT WITH THEY CAN TAKE BACK LOVE SUCKAZ THEY'LL JUST BE SALTY AND YOUR LIFE WILL BE SWEET, BB
A'SALMAU A'LAIKUM.

Edit: Take that degree move to a gay friendly area. Support yourself and make awesome gay friends. Having a lesbian click is amazing      Pay a guy to do that in front of your dad. Tell him thats what de does before he kills him. This is such an extra thing to do but it's more raw. He'll feel the raw awkwardness of it all.      You think she might take pics when you see her though? I think the ""how much was it?"" question is offensive too. I heard my so's pal once told a guy to ONLY get her a Tiffany. She ended being a bitch and it took him years to pay off. If I got a ring pop I'd be excited. When people ask that, I think they miss the entire meaning of the ring. Lowkey putas.     Take your time. It's YOUR EDUCATION. I know PLENTY of people who took a bit of time. It's okay. There is nothing weird with being educated.      Lito suddenly sobbing after bartending had me crying.      Everyone turned into creeps s1 orgy! Lol Yasssd     I love a good showerbeer post without the surprise genitals.     Ohio is a strange state. Someone I know went to a party there and they served deer chili.     It's like having your parents be the best chefs in town, but everyone is discussing Gordon Ramsey at the dinner table.      Taylor Swift      African-American Vernacular English. I answered fully in the top comment.     African-American Vernacular English or simply Ebonics. I lowkey hurts because I know the majority of black folk can speak SAE or Standard American English. They fucking teach us in school. I learned when I took Linguistic Anthropology.      Count Olelf     Thanks!     A ton of colleges have rugby teams! It's pretty cool!     Ah yes! I don't know why I didn't mention the German Bundesliga! I like Schalke 04, M.Gladbach, Bayern (arturo vidal keeps me going) and Dortmund. I know! And tbh we are low ranked in Football (not our women's side though! We're currently ranked 2nd) Dude, watch an MLS game and you'll see a few empty seats. May only be a few, but in a Football county every seat is filled and even lap sitting! I honestly want to visit Mexico to go see a game.     100% agree. If we had time we could be greater! I think they should have AF players trickled in to promote. Like having the first game hosted by Peyton Manning. (Retired, Star Quarterback) Or players attending training sessions or something. It just needs attention!     Hey my name is Choco-Latte.

Bihh..what..

     I wonder what a strippers name would be? Sexy candy chocolate? Delicious donuts?

YES DIS IS DOG lmao girl you crack me up. You're really pretty btw. Lady to lady not creep lol      I love Football, too! MLS, La Liga, Liga MX, and EPL are my main favorites. I'm trying to get into another league! Any suggestions? American sports are irrelevant outside of the U.S unfortunately. I love how international Football and Rugby are. Everyone knows who Pogba is, but ask anyone outside the US who Richard Sherman is and their utterly lost.      Holy shit. I was thinking the same thing. They need to watch Owen.     Yup. We go NUTS over Football. LIKE LETS CHANNEL THIS ENERGY INTO RUGBY. We'd be damn good at it too. We can run. We can tackle. And we can sure as hell pitch/throw. We have a special dude just for kicking like we're set!     I wish we had more serious Rugby here. We can producers great players. No one cares enough to fund it though. We had one pro season      I am honestly so surprised that Rugby has not taken off in the states. It is so damn action-packed. I honestly get off watching rugby sevens. Perry Baker gives me life!      Omg high in church! Lmao I wouldn't be able to concentrate at all!      That first time feeling feels so fancy/isthisreal lol congrats!     The hangover feeling is shit. Next day after smoking feels so damn good! I'm refreshed sista, refreshed..     Does anyone like Florida?  I appreciated Rugby so much more after finding out that my first love, American Football, stemmed from it. Damn, I love this sport! (Also, when I typed Rugby this ball came up. Holy crap, there is a rugby emoji)  Any other American Football crossovers?      Had to google iirc. Jeez lol but cow tipping? To scared to do that!     Dreadlocs? YOU DON'T WASH YOUR HAIR.      I was asked this A LOT as an English major. Sheesh.      My pals and I were hanging out one day in Los Angeles. My friends are in a relationship and they were going to stay in a hotel that night. Hours later, it's time for me to leave and we drive to the hotel so i could say goodbye to them. It's freezing outside. At the door this conversation ensues:
Pal:""im walking you to the door its cold!""

Me:""fuck you guys haha im gonna be going fucking outside!""

Pal:""haha we'll be fucking inside!""     If they are a bully     I wouldn't say I freaked about knowing, it was more about how to let my family know. I hate them not knowing because they really have been my support through other hard things ive had to deal with, and I just feel if i tell them this they will break. But of course i wont know for sure till i tell them... To be honest i dont want to go to a therapist, but maybe a counselor. Therapist tend to make you more confused in my opinion. 

But I will breathe and take MANY MANY deep breaths ( :     Yea im 18 and regardless of my age I never like living in lies or concealing things so im trying to understand, comprehend, then make the best decision. Telling people is hard for me but I know I need too so Im working on who to trust.

The person I like is a friend of mine who is bi as well, and she knows about me AND how I feel about her. I only told her that i MAY like her but little did i know i like her very much. I don't want to like her and don't know how to push it away. Crushes are easy to stop but i believe this isn't a crush so its really hard. 

But all said, Im going to follow any advice I can get because I know that i don't know what the hell to do or exactly what i want.      ENJOY MUSIC BEFORE..WELL YOU KNOW ..  I know I'm BI, no one knows, help  So I just realized, put the pieces together and became aware that im bi. Im just nervous and scared about people knowing, not only friends but family mostly. They mean everything to me but they are also judging people when it comes to this. And the other half of this is that I really like someone but I want to quit liking and maybe even loving them because its too much to have to carry with me. Its hard enough accepting these changes that Im not use to AT all, let alone execute them, when i have no idea how too. I dont wanna lose their friendship but dont know what to do. I constantly feel paranoid that im going to out myself before im mentally prepared too. I just need guidance and most of all comfort.

Edit: I let a pal use this to get help. I forgot to tell her to mention that.
This is her question.      I see. I guess i was referring to the Disney happy go lucky versions. My apologies.      Yea, I mean it's like Spongebob suddenly being a Karate hero fighting a druglord and his henchmen. Kinda off. I understand your point though. The ""childrens"" stories were dark but still aimed at children. Right in the childhood.   Reddit, what are your thoughts on the new children gone warrior movies? Ex:Snow White and the Huntsman and now Hansel and Gretel.  [removed]     Thatsphuked.com may have a different spelling but it scarred me     I found my cat in the tree like that today.

     OCD my friend      I was at a play last night and during an intermission, spotted a lesbian couple. I asked them if they knew the results.

(Not many people knew because it was announced during the play. No cells phones..yadda yadda)

I asked of they wanted to know. I'll never forget the look of fear on one of the girl's face. Romney literally scared this woman, and she didn't even know if he won/lost! I told the results and the relief! You could cut it with a knife.

I was about 11 years old when my biological mother's boyfriend decides that getting drunk and shooting his gun would be a good idea.
  Tonight I told my girlfriend that I loved her for the first time. What are the unique ways you told your significant  other you loved them for the first time?  We were at at party for my friends father and there was a jumper there, (friends father has friends with kids) so we decided to go in when it was empty. We talked for a bit and even jumped a little. Then it was time to tell her. I was scared shitless. So i used pop culture to help ease me along. 

Me: ""Have you heard the song 143 by Ray J?""
Her: ""noo..""
Me: ""well do you know what 143 means?""
Her: ""No, what is it?
Me: ""143 means I Love You....And i do. I do love you.""

TL;DR too scared to tell girlfriend 'i love you' normally so I used a pop song as help.      Erykah Badu

subject350," Cloud porn over London this morning.       Gee.. thanks for the tip, growlers sounds good.   Our first Christmas in Europe!  Hello Redditors,


Wife and I have been together for 11 years now, we have just recently moved to the UK because we always wanted to do live in London and wanted to travel Europe properly. Been here 6 months now and have been taking time out to visit nearby countries and the English countryside. It has been a dream come true, really.


We are going to Berlin on Tuesday for 5 nights so we'll be there on the 25th December. My wife loves all things Christmas and has been wanting to see Berlin for years... so Berlin at this time of the year was an obvious choice given the Christmas markets. So since we are going to be in Berlin and at her favourite time of the year I just want to make it that extra bit special by doing something super romantic besides just taking her out for a nice dinner.

Additionally, I'm hoping places will be open during the Christmas time and we'll be able to explore the city and have some fun. I've heard 24th is the BIG day and 25th is relatively ""normal"". Thoughts please? 


Are there any Berliners around here who could help me with some options and tips. We both like to immerse ourselves in the local culture, we LOVE food, looking forward to the Christmas cheer (or whatever is left of it by then!) and enjoy the little things in life.


My budget is approx 100 Euros for the night, if that helps. We are staying in Mitte and will be there for 5 nights.

tl;dr - couple in Christmas looking for tips of things to do and make a special night out of.      Sorry, new to Reddit! Will post in Berlin. Thanks.   We need this in pubs all over the world. Full p(o)ints to England.    Today I learned that pirates wore an eyepatch to circumvent the adjustment period of going from the light to the darkness below deck.       Regular denim wearer, rare denim washer here, can confirm that no one notices your jeans are unwashed.  But they do look at you weird if you tell them you haven't washed that pair in 1 year.   Today I learned that there are no snakes in Ireland because they couldn't ""make it"" to Ireland when it geographically split from the UK 2000 years ago. Snakeless in Ireland: Blame Ice Age, Not St. Patrick    The Black cab manufacturer is owned by a Chinese company       As a migrant myself I find it very annoying when migrants make no effort to assimilate into the new culture. Resorting to mixing with your own kind is arguably not the best use of your effort to move countries. Might as well just stay put. 
I've noticed this amongst most cultures although Westerners more propensity to mix in general than people from developing countries. This broad brush analysis is based on my experience of living in 3 countries over the last 10 years.      Also makes me hungry and wantbto eat bacon all the time. And im trying to stay vegetarian asmuch as possible.      Easy as. Sweet as. Nah mate, thats the Australian in me.   Reddit is awesome  Just started reading a lot more here thanks to baconreader. It makes my two hour commute easy as.      Oh so that explains all the chinese people with masks all over.... London and Sydney(?)      So incredibly sad! It's stories and incidents like this that make America's easy access to ammunition a bit of a no brainer to be reconsidered. As someone not from the USA (Australian here) makes Little sense to continue having guns being sold so easily. 
May the old man rest in peace and I hope the perp gets punished to the full extent of the law.      She had her regular check not long ago and was all fine. Will be seeing the vet tomorrow morning though anyway        That's a shocking story. I think I'll go see the vet tomorrow anyway.      Thank you for your kind words! We love Coco she's been with us for 6 years and is truly our first child. We've taken her with us and back everywhere even when we moved continents and hemispheres! 

She's starting to behave normally just now and the trip to the park was much more enjoyable. Hopefully this keeps up.      Don't be! She's turned a corner now.      Appreciate your concern and will do if she wasn't running around and being all normal now. Updated.      Good point re reward and positive association. Got any tips? She loves to go to the pub with me every other week. Might take her again tonight and she can see her fav bar staff and get a treat from them.      Yes she did go from being semi normal after the baby to being hurt supposedly from the towel drying. Definitely not normal. I am keeping a close eye on her and she is walking normally and running / pacing around in the park. It's the tail between the legs and the lack of excitement for normal exciting activities that's bothering me. Will keep you posted.      Thanks for the reassurance. I felt that a week or so into it maybe it's got too much for her. We're waking up at odd hours and running around carrying this new pack member (maybe looks like a new leader to her). And Coco is feeling confused and obvs a little ignored. Time for some more doggie love and encouragement.      Thank you. There is lots of encouragement this afternoon here. Sit next to the baby if she wants to. Or just be on her bed. Hopefully Coco improves and can see we love her just as much as we did before the baby arrived.   [Help] new baby and a scared dog  First time post here - looking for tips and help 


We've had Coco for the last 6 years from when she was a pup. Coco is a sensational dog - warm, loving, cuddly and like most dogs of this breed very social. Coco is a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. A Very loving and affectionate dog. 

Last week we had our first child and was brought home on Sunday. Before the baby was brought home I would bring its clothes and swaddles every day for the 5 days.
On Sunday when the baby arrived home we presented it to coco. Coco sniffed and licked its head. Then over the course of the next few days she started to quietly come and sniff the baby when she could. Things were normal. Albeit a bit different for Coco as I can imagine. 

Yesterday though as I was drying coco (we'd walked in the rain) she let out the biggest shriek. I must have pinched her on her leg I thought. Hiwever since then she also started to get scared of me. And my wife. Normally she starts the night by sleeping on our bed. She did this even when the baby was here the last few days but last night she jumped on and as soon as I went to talk to coco she turned her face the other way and started to tremble. I tried talking to her and say things that usually make her happy. She just wouldn't look at me and walk around the house, close to the walls, scared. 

So I let her be since I was clearly making her uncomfortable. With my wife she felt slightly more comfortable. I took her for a walk, which we sometimes do after my dinner. She was not her normal excited self. Usually the lead makes her very happy and jumpy. She also didn't have her dinner. 

This morning again she wasn't her usual self staying aloof and quiet. No excitement at the lead and Walky time. At the park she didn't fetch the ball and appeared to have her tail between her legs. And looking at the exit all the time. This has broken our hearts. We're sad. 

Coco is our first child and have had a great 6 years together. Such a social loving dog having her world turned upside down in a moment of days. I can't begin to imagine how she might be feeling. I'd hate for her lifestyle to get changed because of the child or the fact that I accidentally pinched her maybe last night. 

My gut feel is that the shriek last night was the straw that broke the camels back. 

TLDR - new baby arrived last week and dog is acting strange after a few days. Need help and tips please. 

Edit - thanks for your responses and the concern re a physical injury. I should've mentioned that after the shriek happened. Coco showed no signs of limping or physical pain. As a responsible dog parent I know when she would be in pain. And obviously will consult a doctor if I see this is needed. Here she is jumping on bed and walking normally. Just scared :/

Edit 2 - Gilded! Thank you! I'm just doing what I think every responsible dog parent would. 

I have some good news.. Coco is starting to behave normally and has enjoyed a good walk and a play in the park with everyone. She is back to being bright and bubbly. Earlier this evening after spending time and really letting her take her time to come to me. She has turned a corner and is now walking with ease around the house. She also seems much much more comfortable with me. A signature call we have is I sit down and tap the ground and ask her to come to me. No matter how far she is if she sees me do this she will come running. Yesterday she was not showing any interest in this either to my sadness. Today she has responded. She ran straight to my arms. 
Thanks for all your help here guys. Good news in the end! 

Edit 3 - taking coco to the vet tomorrow morning anyway just to be sure :) no harm there. 

Update - Back from the vet and all is ok. Coco is back to normal and she's finding her place in the pack. Excitement for the lead and the walls to the park and the tennis ball have come back completely. Much to our joy! A regular evening walk with the family and lots of encouragement will continue. Looks like she's enjoying being the older sister now :)   Help - New baby and a scared dog  [removed]     Just went to the Sydney gurudrwara today.

Thought I typed ferns - not sure how I got fauna. But yes. Flora /ferns. Not fauna :)       No problems, dont worry mate. Thanks for your help.      Oh and Antipodes an Aussie/Kiwi cafe? esp with a Flat White on the menu! Can always count on an Australian cafe for good coffe but I may be biased. Will def check it out.      I know, couldnt have gone to Nuremberg although wanted to, decided on Berlin because the museums! and they are mostly open. Got us tickets to the Reichstag too.. so happy about that! 

Thanks for your info, seems to be panning out OK now isnt it. I'm Googling and saving all your links, much appreciated.      Really, if you wouldnt mind.. haha go on then.. table for 2 on the 26th (if open?) for Kay, please. I've ordered in Thai, Czech and Malay at previous occassions before.. survived so far :)     And its not far from where I am staying, thank you!      thank you!      *spine chills*  Put our Christmas tree up earlier and puppy jumped up next to it.       Thank you very much. I Googled before and seemed like things would be open etc. Plus it's our first Christmas here and thought it'd be a good time to see Berlin. Obviously not my brightest moment. 

Like you said not much I can do now. Still keen to have a good time so will try and make the best of whatever is open. Between your suggestions and others I think it might just be OK. I've just finished reading the lonely planet Berlin guidebook and getting really pumped. 
     Thought I'd ring and get a reservation. But the lady on the other end didn't speak any English and I don't speak any German. Great socially awkward moment.      Seriously Samsung loves making these really bad tech ads. Anyone remember the Beckham one for s3.i mean what in the whatever was that..      Oh, always in need of a good suggestion for a local restaurant. Not far from my hotel either. Excellent. Thanks very much.      They shall not take my fapp rights away     Doesn't sound very promising. Perhaps a bad timed trip awaits us? At least they're keeping a few markets open for tourists like us. Also got tickets for the reichstag as it's open and some museums never close too. It's just that I think the trendier side of things would be shut down. 

When I trawled through TripAdvisor some weeks ago the general feel was that most of Berlin stays open.. 
Surely McDonald's would be romantic that night then :)       Plans with Free Unlimited Social Media have been pretty normal in Australia for the last few years.   Got some amazing pics of the London sky this morning. Images enhanced using Snapseed       Australian here. The only other confusing and annoying but I found was the Germans charging you a .20 euro cent deposit called ""pfand"". You're supposed to get this back when you take it back to the recycle centre or something. By the end of my trip I figured I'd have paid about 2 euros towards this. A bit like South Australia, perhaps someone could confirm? Anyway...  We laughed thinking let's do a Kramer and take a truck full to fund some beers.      Can recommend      ,      When I'm trying New clothes on, I'd sometimes pretend I'm in an argument and im laying down a kick ass comment to finish the opponent off, with the look and everything. Because apparently looking good is very important when I'm in a row with someone. The funny thing is I rarely ever have arguments with people.      My thought process - the dudes a famous singer. Why the fuck is that not a compliment!?      Ummm.. I told someone they looked like Meatloaf because they had a ponytail. He wasn't impressed. I didn't get it. I wonder if you are... Haha     This. Everytime I accidentally look at my old Facebook comments.      It's incredibly hard I think to hold a mirror to yourself and at the same time be aware of what it is you're actually looking at.   As you grow older - What is the biggest change that you've noticed in your outlook towards life and/or within yourself?  I've noticed that I've started to trust my instincts more, at work or outside.      Agree. Life is too short to go through all this shit for a deal.      We've had an amazing 2 days visiting the historic sites and all of them were open including museums and the Berlin Church. Amazing Christmas markets at charlottenburg, hands down the best markets I've ever been to. Great food, crafts. 
Biggest compliment I can say for Berlin is that it's people are so friendly and amazing. We've been helped by strangers, just wanting to make sure we know where we're going when looking confused at a map in my hand. 
Today we're off to the Berlin Wall memorial and then an afternoon/night in kreuzberg.   Haha hilarious. (someone translate for me?)        Fucking hell, this looks good.     Peep Show... For the 98th time     ""could of"" 

FFS it's could HAVE, you moron.      England: when someone don't like something say for example that sandwich just says it's alright.      England: when some says ""you right"" they actually mean Hello. And the correct answer is ""You right"". So your conversation goes a bit like this 

Person A - You right
You - You right

and not ""why do you ask, do I look sick?""      Australia: don't look but if you make eye contact with strangers on the street just smile and say ""G'day mate.""  New sleeping position - check.

I'm on to my last 2 months left to live in the UK what are some things to do or see you'd recommend?  Hi guys, Wife and I have been in the UK for the last year and and a half and we've thoroughly enjoyed it. We've seen all the major tourist sites, local sites, and would like to think have given the city life a good go! (Not to mention multiple European trips) We recently moved out of London to Sussex and have seen much of the South too.

We've driven around to pretty much all of Southern England and some parts of Wales. We've also been to York (for the Tour de France - great city!) Some places on my list next are Liverpool, Manchester and Edinburgh. At the same time I'm very interested in exploring more of London that maybe I haven't seen yet or upcoming events I should look into? 

The time has come for us to return home so wanted to get some ideas on some of the stuff we should do before we head home end of September. Not planning on leaving England so anything in the UK and preferably drive-able, doesnt matter how long or far.      Bath is spectacular and we loved the Christmas markets there.

Hope the housekeeping like the koalas and the tip       Don't think so man, but I'd now like to check this one out. Might try and get the Spanish version for lulz     It's a movie my brother and I watched years ago. It's a horror film with 3-4 stories. The only two bits I can remember us #1 this one story about Crows and an old house, a bit like that Adams family house and this housekeeper guard guy. Anyway ends with a lot of Crows everywhere. NFI what the exact story was. 
#2 the second story I remember was about some people (a couple?)  getting lost and ending up in a village. They go to this one house and are fed rabbit stew. I especially remember this part. The village people help them but are quite sinister and when they try to escape they can't. 

It'd be amazing if anyone can find me the name of this movie. It's prob early 90s or late 80s.

     I was making a joke...     It said,""T-65 X-Wing only"" below that. What I meant was that how Integrated Astromech says ""Xwing Only"" but the T70 can use it. I am not talking about the name, only the words below the name. BTL-A4 is the name of the Y-Wing.  Storage Solutions for Mustafar tournament in January.  I need a container as small as possible that can hold
4 Protectorate Starfighter
Focus, Target Lock, Stress, and an extra space for special tokens
Ship and Upgrade cards
Damage deck space
Dice space
Templates

Please tell me what the best option is. I am going to say that there is 1-1.5 feet(30.48-45.72 cm) of space for it. Again, smallest as possible.     Actually, the Pringles come from a GIANT Pringle. Its this huge chip that is cut and placed on cans. Curves and all.

     The title can't say t65 Xwing. It needs to say something like,""You can not equip this cars of you have boost on your action bar."" T65s are just called X-wings, and T70s can use Xwing only upgrades.     Same here     Supreme Commander 2     Next time do it on isometric paper. It is much easier!     No it's not.







Yes it is     Humans built them, then the cars became evil and self aware and ate them for their eyes. They then took the buildings.     So your saying you thought of someone reading your mind in the shower.     The Most American!     Not a dad story, but every time I was told to turn off/on the light, I said no. Then I turned it on/off anyway.  I was then told not to say ""no"", which I then thought was a bad word and never said it. My parents caught on and asked me awful,""Can you do this?"" questions which I had to say yes to. I eventually started saying no again, but felt wrong doing it.

Tldr:Thought no was bad, parents exploited.     Thanks for all the answers. I asked about touring as I have seen MANY videos of people allowed on to tour, even to ride. Thanks again!     But, the A/C gets in there and drives up the bill! Plus, the clothes get cold. THINK ABOUT THE CLOTHES!     Well, first of all the National Park Service is only in one country, so the rest of Earth is unaffected, and Luna and Mars are different celestial bodies... so they have NO say.     That's why you say,""No offence"". It tells the person not to take offence to what you are about to say. Then they take offence ANYWAY.     I know a place where the recycling rate is 99%

M: He did not know the eggs contained eggs!

Egg Company: THEIR EGGS! FRIGGIN EGGS! Why do we need to put a warning eggs when their only eggs?
Judge:People are stupid, Jerry. I hereby find you guilty, and you must put a warning on your box!       Joke response

[Deleted]     I tried collecting fire alarms. But it did not take off and all I have is a BG-12 pull mounted on my wall, not booked up to anything.  Questions about Mustafar Tournament.  Ok I will be quick. The website does not show the information I need, so I will ask here.
1. What will the lunch selection be?
2.Is there a player limit?
3.Is there a register cutoff.
4.Do I need to register now to get an open spot if they are limited?
I hope I can get these answered. Tips for the tournament would be appreciated as well. Never went to a tournament of this magnitude so I am a bit nervous.       Or M3A if you want to play Scum.     Tf2. Nuff said.     Deci S_oon_tir_(Sorry I can't spell it without autocorrect.). Deci tanks shots while Interceptor arc dodges around the prime target. As for upgrades it's hard to go wrong on the deci, but Interceptor needs Royal Guard, Stealth Device, Hull Upgrade, and Push the limit if you have the expansion. Autothrusters instead of Hull if you have Starviper.

 At the start of the combat phase, all bombs explode, cause all enemy to take the effects and not friendly ships. Also, every enemy ship takes an additional damage. You may also drop 20 of an equiped bomb withing range 5 of you.      Since everyone is getting gold, can I have some?     No ice cubes?

I have not bought this version yet, but I have been playing since the original in 2011. I adore this game, and am very good at it. Rebirth does not seem as hard as the original, probably because of more items and the ability to pick up where you left off on a run. I have never completed Rebirth to 1001% or whatever it is, but I am pretty close on PC.
     I would take the elevator. I would just press all the buttons again and be fine.     I think that is a feature. I don't know, I have never had my Switch below 30%.     It's supposed to do that I think. It stops so you can go charge it and save your game. You might be able to turn that off in the settings, but I have not tested it.     GOLD TRAIN! WOOOHOOO!

subject3535,"    Unfortunately, you're right in regards to the boots on the ground thing. I just hope Activision doesn't toss IW to the wayside. There was a lot of good stuff in there that I think warrants a sequel.     Has Activision said anything about making another Infinite Warfare? I hope they realize they had a pretty good game on their hands and would be willing to try again in few years, after the ""we want to go back to the boots of the ground"" hype dies down.  [COD] Why Should COD go back to WWII  [removed]     I'm actually hoping for a return to a modern day setting. I think COD is getting progressively better at telling stories in their campaigns and I would want COD to try their hand at telling a story in the vain of  Medal Of Honor:Warfighter, but obviously much better.     In my opinion, the campaign doesn't get enough recognition or praise. Although, it defiantly had its plot holes and flaws, I really found myself attached to the characters, the missions, both primary and side missions, were really fun and tried have some deeper commentary with discussions about the nature of leadership. Overall, I would say its been one of the better campaigns out of the recent COD releases. 

Another aspect of IW that shined was the, for lack of a better term, military aspect. The military consultants were the MVPs of the dev team because of how well they were able to implement actual naval terminology and military shorthand into the dialog without having it feel forced or hamper the storytelling and make the Retribution feel like a legitimate naval warship only in space.      I did read everything you wrote (twice), and thanks for the great insight. My problem with the don't drink the Kool-Aid bit is that the Kool-Aid would include the lessons about integrity and adhering to the Navy's core values of Honor, Courage, and Commitment. In fact, Xavier uses an example of a candidate lying about a uniform inspection to the instructors, and then coming clean about it as what not to do, yet something like integrity is essential to surviving BUD/S and being a productive member of the teams.      No. I definitely want to go the Officer route.      Thanks for the info both on the SEAL billet and OCS. Do you know what the odds are for getting a billet for EOD?      I've heard that OCS wasn't the greatest from others, but mainly I was referring to the book.       I wasn't posing a choice so much as I was looking for input about advice I found in a book written by a SEAL officer and OCS grad which basically said, to paraphrase, OCS sucks and you shouldn't really try if you want to be a SEAL. I don't necessarily agree with that, and was looking for input/other points of view.     I actually got that line from the book ""Breaking BUD/S"" which was written by a SEAL Officer who graduated from OCS, which was why I wondered if it had any validity.   Pros and Cons of OCS  Right now I'm in my second year of college with the intention of applying to OCS with a billet for either Naval Special Warfare or EOD. So far, I've heard varying viewpoints on OCS, with a lot of them saying that OCS is a pointless, stupid process full of fat uninspired candidates and that if you're going in with a SpecWar or EOD billet, then you shouldn't make much of an effort to be a leader or buy into any of the stuff you're taught there. 

Now, maybe its the eternal optimist in me, but I don't think that OCS is as bad as its made out to be, and even if it is, you should make the best effort possible, especially if you have a SpecWar or EOD billet and set an example for your classmates. 

So, what I'm asking is can someone break down the pros and cons of OCS and explain the dos and don'ts as well as what kind of candidate you should strive to be.      But what I'm not getting is what counts as big navy bullshit? Is it the ship related stuff a SEAL wouldn't have need for or is it the stuff about the navy's core values?  Breaking BUD/S and OCS  I recently bought the book ""Breaking BUD/S"" by d.h. xavier a few days ago as a go to guide for the whole BUD/S application process. I'm halfway through and so far its been extremely helpful, detailed, and honest. The only issue I have came when the author discussed surviving OCS. Long story short, according to the Xavier, OCS is a pointless, stupid process worse than hell week full of fat, uninspired candidates and that if you're a candidate with a SpecWar billet, you shouldn't really try to make a an effort to be a leader or buy into any of the stuff you're taught there.

 Now, I haven't been to OCS, so I can't say whether or not what the author says has any sort of validity, but even it is as bad a process as he makes it out to be, wouldn't you still want to perform to the best of your ability and be an example to your classmates, especially if you've got a SpecWar billet? 
     What if I'm intending to go the Officer route but haven't gotten to the point where I can apply for OCS, which is where I would get medical cleared? Do I wait until I can apply for OCS to contact a mentor, or should I do it as soon as possible?  Benefits of a SEAL mentor  I was recently on sealswcc.com and found the email address in order to find the contact info for a local SEAL mentor. Now, I'm a bit of a ways off from applying to to BUD/S and mentors are under no obligation to train you, so what are some of the benefits of knowing your local SEAL mentor, specifically for someone looking to become an officer?     Thanks for the advice. Since you mentioned it, can you discuss the relationship and/or the differences between NSW and big Navy?     First, I want to say thank you guys for being honest with your responses. Hearing it from guys who have gone through/are going through the process really helps.

Secondly, since it was mentioned that NSW gets O's from the street, the Academy, ROTC, and OCS, what can an OCS guy do to be competitive for SOAS selection when compared to guys from ROTC or the Academy? Would getting in contact with a local SEAL mentor help?     Really? I would think NSW would want O's that have had prior leadership experience more than guys off the street. My biggest concern with just trying out for BUD/S is not being prepared enough. I get that there's no such thing as being 100% prepared for BUD/S, but going into it, I want to be the best I can possibly be, not just for myself, but also for the other students.   Considering going SWO before SEALs. Is this advisable?  I'm currently in my second year of college with the intention of going the OCS route and eventually getting into BUD/S. However, I'm considering going into Surface Warfare beforehand in order improve on both my leadership abilities and my physical fitness. Is this an better idea than trying to go straight into BUD/S right out of OCS?

Additionally, I'm also looking into the Baccalaureate Degree Completion Program (BDCP), but I haven't been able to turn up recent or in depth information. Can anyone inform me about the specifics of the program or if it even exists anymore?     Mark Meer and Jennifer Hale voice npc's who are having a conversation on the Nexus, you go up to interact with them and they say ""excuse me we're having a conversation, do you mind"". and as you leave, they say ""damn new guys"", ""I know, right""      And can there be a Kett with two long antennas who's constantly trying to steal that recipe?     Not really. I'll willingly admit that the ST races could be formidable in a space conflict, but its the fact that the Federation, and by extension, Starfleet, aren't in the Business of fighting wars, whereas the ME species have been fighting each other for centuries. Who do you think would win a fight, the guy who took a few self defense classes or the guy whose been fighting professionally since he was a kid. There's also the fact that for the most part Starfleet wouldn't do anything they consider to be unethical or immoral to an enemy, but the ME species don't necessarily have that problem, as you can see with the Genophage, the destruction of the Alpha Relay in Arrival, ect.      I never really got into DS9, but if you're talking about the dominion war, then sure that's one example, but look at all the stuff the Romulans managed to to the Federation and get away with in TNG and Voyager (kidnapping Starfleet crew members and using them to assassinate a Klingon govt. official, taking over a ship and killing the entire crew, ect.), or the alternate universe in the TNG episode ""Yesterday's Enterprise"", where the Klingons have effectively defeated the Federation, or the Enterprise C in that very same episode which was destroyed and its crew were captured by Romulans, or all the times on Voyager where the ship had been taken over or nearly destroyed, or the Equinox from Seasons 5 and 6 of Voyager, which had its entire crew killed by what were essentially space slugs, or all the ships the Borg destroyed in ""The Best of both Worlds"". Also, the species and groups that have managed to do this to the Federation were primarily Naval forces, and didn't have the ground forces or specialized units like the STG, Asari Commandos, Spectres, or N7s So if Starfleet can barley deal with species that don't have dedicated fighting forces, imagine how they'll fare against ones that do.     I could see Cerberus being like Waylund-Yutani and attempt to study and weaponize the Xenomorphs, until it blows up in their faces and they send Shepard in to clean up the whole mess.     When Cerberus got their hands on Shepard's body, the first organ they replaced was the liver.     Sure the Enterprise has firepower and like I said, they could probably give the Alliance a run for its money, but when you include the other species and factions, the Federation doesn't last more than a month. What does the Federation do when the Geth introduce viruses into their ship computers, or when the Krogan drop asteroids on Federation planets, or the Batarians start using terror attacks, or the Salarians release plagues that effect Vulcan or Ferengi biology, or Cerberus starts kidnapping and experimenting on Federation citizens, or the Rachni reproduce faster than Starlet can destroy them, or the Quarians start retrofitting Starfleet technology and using it against them? These are the things the Milky Way species have done in war, and Federation has never encountered anyone who does any of this. So while yes, they may have the technological advantage, they've got nothing on the Milky way Species tactically.      I think the Alliance could take on the Federation and if not win, give them a run for their money. My reasoning is that despite the Federation's advanced technology, Starfleet is not a military organization, so they wouldn't be prepared for the strategy and tactics the Alliance would employ, plus they have no ground forces or equivalent to biotics or the N7s. And although the Federation has encountered and fought against militarized species in the Romulans, Klingons and so on, they either win by the skin of their teeth or outright lose (in the TNG episode ""Yesterday's enterprise"", the Federation is for the most part wiped out by the Klingons)       Its the same with Allers in ME3.      Are you thinking of Brooks?     The weird shove off is in both ME2 and ME3, mainly when Shep is at a counter and you choose to leave. Another weird interrupt animation is in the beginning of ME3 is when you choose to interrupt James, and he does this 'whatever man' waive at you. 

     For me its the drinking animation. I don't drink, so can anyone tell me if they've seen anyone aggressively shaking their head as if they're a dog that just got sprayed with water after they've downed a glass of something at a bar. 

And the punching animations. When Shepard punches the reporter in ME1, the way he/she swings their arm is both hilarious and nonsensical(it looks like a slap with a closed hand)     Occasionally, that happens too.     Rather than an Omega like station getting infected by the Necromorphs, I would want to see Omega itself get infected. Imagine a group of Mercs coming back to Omega from a job to raid a base of this mysterious group that's been kidnapping settlers in the Terminus systems and as part of their payment, they decide to bring back this large obelisk that they think is just decoration and intend to sell once they get back. Eventually, they get the back and that obelisk starts to glow, and pretty soon, Omega gets overrun with the necromorph virus with only Afterlife being the last safe refuge.     Nah, it was a semi-casual, so only one future weapon per person. We saved the heavy weapons and omni blades for prom     You know, for as much as people make fun of dancing Shep (and rightfully so), a few of my friends and I tried dancing like Shepard at a school dance, and we actually got complimented on our dancing skills.  What is your least favorite/most humorous character animation in the ME trilogy?    What sci-fi property would you want to see crossover into the ME universe?  This has been topic of endless debate between my friends and me, and I wanted to get some outside opinions. Personally, I would like to see the Predator or the Cylons from Battlestar Galactica.      From what little we've seen of the Nomad, I think it'll be easier to control. I can't wait for Youtube videos of players drifting or doing donuts in it. 

Fast   Furious: Andromeda Drift     I don't think we'll see villainous pathfinders, so much as Pathfinders that made difficult choices. Imagine if we found out that one of the Pathfinders destroyed a native village or city in order to gain access to resources their species needs or to defend their settlement against an attack and we have either negotiate a truce Star Trek style or aid our fellow Pathfinder in fighting off the natives. Those kind of morally ambiguous choices are what I hope to find in the game.       I think there will be. I read somewhere that there are going to be quests where you discover what happened to the other Arks, so at some point you'll probably encounter the other Pathfinders.   The Pathfinders in ME:A  One of the more exciting aspects of the ME:A lore I'm looking forward to exploring is that of the Pathfinders. I think one of the coolest parts of the lore in the original trilogy were the specters but i felt like we never got to learn about or explore that side of the universe beyond a couple of codex entries or meeting a few specters that either immediately die or are killed by us. With the Pathfinders, I hope Bioware give us the opportunity to explore and learn this really cool idea. What ideas for the Pathfinders would you like to see in Andromeda or what aspect of them would you like to explore once Andromeda releases?  Gamespot feels like Andromeda is being rushed. Does anyone agree, and if so, why?  I just got done watching an segment of Gamespot's The Lobby and the topic was wether ME:A was being rushed due to both the March 21 release date and the lack of any kind of extended gameplay footage. In regards to the lack of gameplay, I feel like Bioware is playing it close to the vest in order to give players a feeling of surprise when they first play. As for the release date, they've had their eye on a first quarter 2017 release date for a while now not mention the fact that its been in development for 5 years now.

  Pitch a Commander Shepard mixtape  The other day, I'm going through my 7th ME3 playthrough while listening to Pandora, and after an hour or so, I had a somewhat humorous thought:""What if Commander Shepard made a mixtape?"" So I wanted to see if anyone could pitch few track names, a title or anything (I imagine one or two would be diss tracks towards Udina or the council) 

""I'm Commander Shepard and this is the most fire mixtape on the citadel""     I always thought a show about the merc groups would be a combination of Black Sails and the Sopranos.     Miami Vice had neon colored suits, so I assume there will be neon colored armor?  Pitch a TV series based in the Mass Effect universe  I've been getting into and watching a lot of discussion regarding the constant failures of video game movies in the wake of Assassin's Creed's release. I believe that one of the problems is the that a lot of video game stories and universes don't work when reworked and compressed into hour and a half or two hour runtimes, and that long form storytelling would work for a lot of these properties, which leads into my question: If a major TV network or streaming service got the rights to make a show in the ME universe, where/ when would it be set, who would it follow, and what network or service would you like to see it on? A few of my ideas are: 

1. A show about the Terminus Systems mercenary groups (Blood Pack, Blue Sons, Eclipse) set before and maybe a little after ME2. I think there's a lot left to explore in that part of the ME universe, and I can see it exploring the cultures of the groups, their role on Omega and their interactions with Aria and their rivalries with one another. 

2. A show focusing on Cerberus. It would have to be pre ME3, but  I could see it having a vibe similar to shows like Homeland or 24, where you focus on one agent and the various missions he/or she takes. It would also allow us to further explore the shadowy covert side of the ME universe  

3. A show focusing on Anderson. I can see it beginning right after the First Contact War, and have it show what led to his nomination for the Spectres, the events of the book Revelations, and eventually him becoming the first captain of the Normandy. It would also allow us to see the beginnings of the ME universe as we know it. We could see the origins of human biotics, the start of groups like Cerberus and the Terra Firma party, humanity learning to integrate itself into the larger galactic community, the start of hostilities between humans and batarians, etc. 

As for networks, I would like to see it on either HBO or Netflix.      Fair enough point, but I still would have liked to have seen a good balance between covert missions to find the catalyst and major planet wide battles. I think games like Halo: Reach had a good balance where in some missions you were conducting recon at night and others where you were fighting in cities that were getting glassed by the Covenant. 

On a somewhat humorous side note, did Shepard punch some Alliance admiral in the face before the trilogy, because after three games of becoming the first human Spectre and saving the galaxy numerous times, he (or she) still hasn't gotten promoted.      Fair enough point, but even SOF units see front line combat at some point. But its not just in regards to missions (I'll get to that later), but also in other aspects of the overall game, such as: 

1. The aesthetics: I know that gritty and dirty visuals aren't the Mass Effect style, but I felt like in a war against an armada of nigh indestructible machines who take over entire star systems at a time, there should have been more, for lack of a better term, grime in ME3's visuals. Say what you will about the overall movie, but I think Rogue One did a good job of showing how dirty (literally) war can be with things like dirt on weapons and armor, vehicles that look scuffed and scratched and dented from use and constant battles. I think it would have fit in more with the story of ME3 than the usual clean and shiny visuals of the series. 

2. The missions: Referring to my point at the beginning, even if the crew of the Normandy are considered to be a Special Operations team, even they would see some frontline combat at some point in the war, especially since Shepard is the most knowledgeable person in the galaxy in regards to the Reapers. The thing is that I just felt like we didn't see or participate in enough of those major battles occurring throughout the galaxy to really feel like I was in this  conflict. I wish we could have gotten more things like the final battle in London, or the fall of Thessia or the opening in Vancouver. This could could have also been done by adding more variety to those side missions Hackett gives you. Imagine doing stuff like rescuing downed pilots, infiltrating Cerberus ships to steal intel, calling in airstrikes on enemy positions, stuff that a Special Operations team would do in a real war.  Did Mass Effect 3 feel like a proper war story?  I'm currently on my 7th or so play through of ME3, and something that I realized during the first hour or so is that I don't think ME3 tells a very good war story. What do you guys think?     I really like the idea of making the conflict between the Alliance and the Batarians a central part of the trilogy, but what I would is make the ""Bring down the sky"" DLC an actual side quest in ME 1 and the outcome of that, either stopping the Batarians who hijacked the asteroid or your failure to do so, would result in increased tensions going into ME2.  

In terms of Cerberus, I would either go with a version of the original concept for them introduced in ME1 where they're a secret division of Alliance Intelligence tasked with preventing another event like the First Contact War and making sure Humanity stays influential in galactic politics, or they're a Private Military Contractor ran by TIM, who was a former N7 soldier and First Contact War veteran (I realize in ME canon, Anderson was the First N7 recruit, but I would rewrite it so that he was one of the first)     Although I agree that overall role of Cerberus in ME3 made no sense, one aspect that I thought had potential was the idea that some members were defecting to join the Alliance. I think rather than turn Cerberus into a bargain bin version of the Empire from Star Wars, they should have run with that idea and turned it into a full fledged civil war between those who agree with the 'humanity first at all costs' mentality (led by the Illusive Man) and those who became disillusioned with the lengths TIM is willing to go to achieve his goals, such as attempting to use the Collector base (probably led by Miranda and/or Jacob) and depending on whose side you agree with, you aid them in various side missions (an example would be during the side mission to retrieve the Ex-Cerberus scientists, you either help them escape and join the Alliance, or transmit their location to TIM)  If you could rewrite any part of the Mass Effect story/lore, what would it be and why?  If you could rewrite any part of the Mass Effect trilogy or the lore (characters, organizations, events in and out of the games) what would you rewrite it as, and why?     If candy companies were drug cartels?  I recently heard someone mispronounce El Chapo as El Choco. This got me thinking what if candy companies were organized and behaved like drug cartels. Can anyone think of any funny names, scenarios, ect. ?     Could you elaborate on how the comments were irritating? It's a complaint I've never heard before
     I hadn't planned on it.     Unfortunately, it was. I'm glad it got renewed for a second season, though.     My only question about the it's all on Steve's head theory is  was that shot of Steve in #2 taking place in his head, or some sort of manifestation?      The younger brother is the smartest and most likable, but I don't like the will they, won't they thing with him and his partner. CBS has run that cliche to the ground with shows like NCIS.      True.     I can completely get the preachy element. It tries to have a message at the end of most episodes, but it can go off onto after school special territory.     Totally agree. Stopped watching after season 2  I just watched 7 seasons of Blue Bloods  In my free time, I've managed to explore some shows I've had saved in my list for a while, but never had the time to watch. One of those shows was the CBS cop show Blue Bloods. After watching the six seasons on Netflix and now having saw the 7th season, I've got some pros and cons. 

For those who haven't seen it, Blue Bloods is about the trials and tribulations of a New York family with three generations in Law Enforcement, with Tom Selleck as the Police commissioner and Donnie Wahlberg as the detective as well as a normal beat cop and a district attorney in there as well. 

Some of the pros are: 

1. Its tackles sensitive topics; Most cop shows occasionally tackle some real world topic, but Blue Bloods makes it a regular occurrence where all four of the main characters encounter some kind of moral, ethical, or legal quandary that deals with a real world social or political issue (everything from gang violence, racial stereotyping, domestic violence, sexual harassment in the workplace, police brutality and everything in between) and later debate it with the rest of the family at their traditional Sunday dinner, usually where they try and see it from multiple perspectives, which is welcome change from most other cop shows today.

2. The characters are not all super dark: Another tendency of cop shows, and network TV in general is to have the characters have some kind of dark past, or some kind of lingering trauma or personal issue going on. Blue Bloods doesn't do that. Compared to a lot of its cop drama brethren, the show is pretty bright and the characters are more or less good people who try to do the right thing, which can be quite refreshing. 

3. The characters are also surprisingly deep: A lot of cop dramas tend to have characters that are either wire thin or little more than caricatures. Blue Bloods is slightly different. A lot of the best qualities  of the main characters can also be some of their biggest faults. A big example is that Tom Selleck's character is extremely ethical and rule oriented, however that can make him too rigid when when it comes to situations where most people would have use their influence or bent the rules.

As for the negatives: 

1. Its not for everyone: The show, despite its attempts at debating certain topics, still has a clear opinion on a lot of things and if you don't share those opinions, then its not for you. 

2. Donnie Wahlberg: Don't get me wrong, I like Donnie Wahlberg the actor, but I can't stand his character in this show. Whiny, stupidly written, and the living embodiment of plot armor. 

3. Self-rightiousness: The show tends to go out of its way to make the main characters morally superior to the detriment of everyone else. Got a different idea on what's right and wrong? Too bad, Donnie Wahlberg's right! Caught in a situation that isn't black and white? Shut up, Magnum P.I. knows what to do!

4. Its corny: It tries to be funny, and its not. Its tries to be cool, and its not. It tries to be original, and its probably been done by 10 other shows in the last 5 years, half of them were probably on CBS. 

I realize I might have put too much thought into a Friday night CBS cop drama, but the show kinda surprised me in some aspects.

     I wouldn't put it past them, especially Nick Spencer.     It could still count. I've heard nothing but good things about it, but is it that cliched?  What is the most cliche filled show you've seen on TV recently?  For me, its a tie between half the shows running on CBS (anything with NCIS in the title, MacGyver, and especially Blue Bloods)      I remember a friend of mine saying no.  What's the most cliched TV show(s) you've seen  [removed]     While the Ultimate universe is gone, sure, characters and items have made their way to the 616 verse. Miles, Ultimate Reed Richards, Ultimate Thor's hammer, and a few others. So, its not much of a stretch to think that Ultimate Cap somehow managed to find his way to 616.   [Secret Empire spoilers] A question about Cap  Withe the reveal in the latest issue of Secret Empire where spoiler another Steve Rogers appears out of nowhere, some people are theorizing/debating that the new Steve is the Cap from the Ultimate universe. I haven't read anything ultimate in a while, so I'm a little rusty on that universe's Cap. Can someone do a compare/contrast of the two Caps in regards to their personalities, ideals, differences ect. 

Also, feel free to offer your opinions on the reveal and the theory as well.     I think the best way to introduced the X-Men/mutants in general is to just introduce them. Maybe say the aftereffects of Infinity War, which is bound to alter the fabric of space and time, causes the manifestation of the X-gene worldwide. 

As for the X-Men, I would want them to go back to the basics, like with Spider-Man, where its the original 5 members, maybe with one or two additional members from the Claremont run.  Roger Ailes, architect of conservative TV juggernaut Fox, is dead at 77       I wouldn't be mad at either. Both have the physicality, the charm and the acting chops.      Can someone do a compare/contrast between 616 and ultimate Cap? I haven't read the Ultimate books in a while so I'm kind of rusty when it comes to the differences between the two.     The story's nothing unique or revolutionary, sure, but it's the execution of the plot with the acting, the score, the dialogue, etc. that made it enjoyable. Also, I really liked how the overall premise tied into a real event with the Arab Spring. It makes the show seem more grounded than you're typical spy story.  I just saw The Night Manager and...  I was not expecting something this good. This is probably the best James Bond movie that wasn't actually a James Bond movie that I've seen in a long time. The acting is incredible; If you ever needed a reason for Tom Hiddleston to be the next Bond, this show is it.      I just found out that Horse Soldiers is getting made  into a movie that's supposed to release in 2018 

http://www.wearethemighty.com/articles/7-upcoming-movies-we-want-to-see-at-the-base-theater     CBS is just released the trailer for, and this is the actual title, ""SEAL TEAM"". If this doesn't look like a poor man's SIX, I don't know what does.

     Comey-Wan Kenobi      The syllabus has always been my achilles heel. Whenever I receive one, I always read it once, then forget to look at it for the rest of the semester. Maybe I should start having them be the first thing in my notebook folders, or just tape them to my ceiling so I wake up reading my syllabus.   Any advice about not missing Homework deadlines?  With my semester wrapping up, I'm worried my grades might not be as strong as they could be, not because of my participation in class, but that I tended to miss deadlines for my online homework assignments. This has been an ongoing problem and i don't know how to fix it. I'm thinking about going back to a homework planner like I had in high school, but I'm not sure if that's the best or the most permanent solution. 

Does anyone have any advice?      For the longest time, I thought that was Steve Blume with some extra base in his voice.     Now that I think about it, there is a series about a bunch of vets who are kind of lovable screwups who work the night shift at a Texas Hospital. It's called the night shift, and it's on Netflix. It's sort of a hybrid of the office, scrubs, and M.A.S.H.     The show was edgy for something Spider-Man centric. I also like how they tried to create new villains for Peter to face, and Electro was probably the most sympathetic version I've seen in a while.      Really great suggestions, though in regards to Aquaman, he doesn't have to be a native to either Miami or Hawaii. I also think Atlantis can be either in the Atlantic or in the Pacific, as the DCEU seems to be suggesting given their design of and cast choices for Aquaman. I think a good middle ground would be to say that Atlantis is located in the Pacific a few dozen miles off what is now the Hawaiian islands.       Boston's an interesting choice for Superman, why choose it? 
  Does anyone remember the MTV Spider-Man show?  I used to own it on PSP discs as a kid and would watch them on plane rides. I recently caught it on Amazon video a few days ago, and it was surprisingly good despite the early 2000's techno score, the fact the Peter wore purple pants (that always bothered me growing up) and the recycled footage.      I both agree with and share that sentiment. Though, the visible part isn't a bad thing to a certain extent. For example, having a flag outside of your home or a small sticker or patch on something isn't a bad thing, but (for me as an Ame",0

A read somewhere that there should be a system in place where, say the basic income is 100 a week.

We eventually manage to make it back to his place, 3 hours later and I passed out on the floor. I've greened out before but nothing like this. I thought I'd lost my mind. Any thoughts?

TLDR: smoked weed that made me see aliens     Selling it to the family probably.     Thanks! I've been trying :)     That's what I was trying to do. I'm not the best technically so I thought I could at least tell a story. Thank you :)     Thanks for the kind words :)     Thank you :)     Frustration probably. He's inside his own head a lot.

subject3594,"    About a week ago in that area there was a gas station (now burned down) where a couple African American teenagers had been harassing the indian clerk for weeks so he shot into the air. This caused lots of protests and lots of tension in that area.  There have also been lots of murders around that area recently.  Soooo yeah Milwaukee the most segregated city in the US!  (I say as a white male living in the sub urbs who hardly ever goes into town)     He was armed but it is still unclear if he was threatening the officer but there is helmet footage that will come out in the future     The police officer who shot the man was actually black although recently there has been a lot of shootings and racial tension in Milwaukee especially in that area     The grammar is atrocious please pay more attention in those college classes AND PLEASE KNOW THE DIFFERENECE BETWEEN THEN AND THAN.

These aren't people doing just because they hate white's, but because they are angry and frustrated that their life will never go anywhere.  there aren't any opportunities there.  You'll live with your parents many join gangs and that's all.     It's actually more segregated there are actually more smaller pockets like there is a very large Laos population in 1 neighborhood and nothing else.

I just see it as another job.  Also could you explain why this has 5 downvotes?  I mean I'm a communist like is that why or what     Communism doesn't kill, horrible communist dictators do     Yes but Paladins was changed to be more like overwatch and yes overwatch is defenetly inspired by TF2 it does add more UNIQUE characters and doesn't just combine a bunch of abilities one of the characters have and call it new     No as much as a game conveniently has many similarities and releases just after said game that had massive success       Doomfist confirmed?

subject3605,"    Bruh.  Who let the dogs out?    [WP] Tired of living in his older brother's shadow, Imgur declares war thus starting the Imgur-Redditor War. You are a soldier on the front lines, write about your experiences fighting for your site.    As a very young economist who has a test on it in a week, can someone break down the fundamentals of economics, microeconomics, and macroeconomic?  Yes, I know I know. I should've studied sooner but some thing or another always came up--I know this is asking for a lot but even a link to a good site that breaks things down well would be helpful. I'am so sorry to be bothering anyone who takes the time to help.  Hypothetically speaking, how would one go about selling their soul to someone?       Hints dropped by my S.O. 
I thought she had a boyfriend and the conversation went something like this... 
Me: Do you have a boyfriend? 
Her: I guess that's up to you. 
She was basically telling me ""Hey. Ask me out so you can be my boyfriend."" 
I learned this a year later. 
I almost missed having a girlfriend if she wasn't determined enough.      Doubt many people will this but here it goes.
We both got placed in the same religion class and I was looking for a new friend and I saw her and she seemed shy and introverted (just like me!) so I sat next to her and tried to strike a conversation. Fast forward two weeks later I told her I wanted my geometry to actually die. She laughed and turns out she also has dark humor so...that's how I began to court her.   I have some sort of cut or injury or something somewhere near my coccyx. Does anyone know what it could be? I'll do the best I can do to describe it bellow.  So, take the fact that I believe my injury is near the coccyx with a grain of salt because that's only a very rough guess. So, this will sound crude but I think it might be the best way to describe it. This cut or injury is closer to the top of my butt crack. Imagine it as somewhere between my back and my butt but it's inside of me. Not inside inside, it's outside of the errrrr...hole but closer to the top. 
It bleeds, but never hurts. It might itch if I say put toilet paper to try and staunch the bleeding but no pain. It's actually been going on for a while (1 Year to a maximum of two) but the normal doctors I go to don't really have any good idea what it is aside from a cut. I have been prescribed steroid cream and that seemed to work but due to me forgetting at times to put it in regularly it hasn't been effective (my fault). 
Recently, I've felt that it feels that this ""cut"" has turned into some sort of groove, and there's this little bump along it that feels sort of like a sack that I believe could be filled with pus. Again, just a theory. Any idea what this is? And I know it sounds gross, but I'am a clean person but money is tight and going to the doctors every time does get expensive but I'm getting worried it could turn into something more serious.

I did read somewhere that they even had their own groups which attacked and harassed the occupied forces. I want to know how successful it was towards them, if it even worked, and what happened to this that simply refused to retract their beliefs.

Have you heard? The government says they're introducing a new stimulus package, see if it can get the market going again. If you ask me, I don't think it'll work. It didn't work before, it won't work again and besides! Surely you don't expect old men in suit and ties to help us start creating dank memes again? No...I think we just have to let this run its course. There have been other times that this has happened. Years ago and it will happen againmaybe next time we'll learn. 

I hope I'm not boring you by the way, I'm sure you've heard countless tales of old stock traders like myself but if you don't have anything better to do maybe settle in, watch the fire, drink your ros, I know I've drunk plenty of it. 

Many say that the crash came suddenly, that none of the signs were there, that we were caught flat footed. That wasn't the case. Don't believe anything they tell you, they're just bitter over what happened. The signs were there. Memes were being made at a record high! People were investing in normie memes without any real clue as to their value but who cares? They were cheap and people were making a quick buck from investing in those normie memes, penny memes essentially. I got caught up in it to, one of my friends, hmm, if you can even call him a friend. 

He was one of those men they warn you not to trust, men with canes and fedoras but I was younger, more innocent back then, he seemed like a respectable fellow though he could use a shave if you ask me. Nonetheless he introduced me to the world of Memes and soon I made my first investment, it was an old Harambe meme. Yes, laugh. I know, who would invest in a meme that old? I didn't know but fortunately for myself I made some profit off it and soon just like the world I was buying and selling memes like there was no tomorrow! I still remember the flood of upvotes as I posted meme dumps, meme collections. I remember when you could actually make a profit. 

Along the way I met a girl and, well I seemed to charm her with my personality, whatever that was. I suppose the glamor of being part of the NASDANQ was alluring to her and so we dated, my old friend, the salty bastard that he was jumped from a bridge upon discovering this. Why? Turns out I had stolen the girl he was after though he was doing a poor job trying to woo her with talks of My Little Pony. Ah well, who needed him? It's just less competition in the end. 

One night we tied the knot and made love, smocking anything we could get our hands on, in the morning I remember us laughing aboutwelleverything. Everything was funny to us. It might have just been the rare Pepes we were on, though. As the months went on I grew richer and richer and our lives seemed all the more happier, in fact I even got her to try her hand at a little investing, made more upvotes than I did my first time and I was proud of her and I think she was proud of herself to.

The next part is hard for me, friend so excuse me if I drag this on but you know why the stock market was as high as it was? It was because we won the war against 4chan. 4chan for crying out loud! That cancerous empire at the corner of the world but we didn't do it alone, no, I remember reading the news of the new joint alliance between us and tumblr. Hell! Even Imgur joined in, our closest allies who was essentially our son and we won! It was a bloody fight but we did it, we drove them back and weakened them so much that they would never spread their cancer into this world again. 

And so the world got high. 

We got high on our own success, thinking we deserved to get high on all of this but because of what we did we only sewed the seeds for our destruction. 
It began when meme dumps, normally a great investment began to lose value, there weren't as many upvotes being given out. Perhaps people were just looking at other options, independent memes. I remember shrugging that day. I was still make a profit. A huge profit mind you, I had begun compiling 500 meme long dumps, that was all part of the problem. The inflation. Then the downvotes came, people complaining that there was not enoug OC. That they had seen it all 

I ignored them, there'd always be people wanting to look at the same old memes, at the same old reposts, always have always will, but I was wrong. Then one day in an act of desperation one company sold all their meme stocks proclaiming in this age they were worthless, you should have seen the panic as everyone tried to sell what they had. The market plummeted before our very eyes and then it crashed! Everyone had lost. 

Everything was gone. We had gone from rich to beggars in a day. My wifewell I don't think she wanted to become a beggar, that day I came home she was standing on the window sill, she looked me in the eye and smiled. 

That smile is etched permanently into my mind, her last words? ""Dicks out for Harambe."" She whispered those words so softly that I could scarcely hear them as she jumped. I ran to grab her but I wasn't fast enough! I wasn't fast enough! Sorry. I got emotional over this part, I need some ros. 

That's better, those weeks I laid in a depression, I considered jumping myself to but what good would that do? I remember coming to this same pizza place, sitting down and looking through the now empty meme market and saw a meme that made me chuckle. I can't remember what it was only that it made me smile. It gave me hope that perhaps OC could save us all but for now, we'll look outside. We're all beggars tonight. 

Oh! And before I go, if you're ever sad drink some ros and look at memes, they're much funnier that way.     I love this, it reminded me of Waiting for Godot     Dude. Dude. You're awesome.

subject3614,"    made my day!     In this case for nothing, the same way I don't clean my palette and never wash it, i don't clean up my table and this is the result.     thanks for such a comment     This piece took about hour and half. To get to this piece it took me about 1 and a half year. I am self taught that watched few videos of Alvaro Castagnet and Joseph Zbukvic, and since I don't consider myself any good I believe this is a sign that if you try really hard and work on yourself everyday you can do good art. Practice makes perfect is all that matter in my opinion. (Doesn't mean that this piece is perfect)     I had this same problem when I started in 2015. I was trying and trying and never figuring it out. Than I bought videos of great Alvaro Castagnet and amazing Joseph Zbukvic (on http://www.apvfilms.com/show_artist.asp?id=24 ) Than I came across Keiko Tanabe, Michal Jasiewicz and many more. I picked up things from their videos or just from gazing at their works and started doing this. For me important thing is having a good sketch with clear lights and shadows and paint with limited colour palette.
     I use combination of primary colours, never the black you can buy in stores. just mix your own blacks and darks and you will see the difference. since it will be a mix you will get a hit of this and a hint of that colour in it and it will create much natural look.     can do it later     I know what you meant with the muddy space and I totally agree. Glad I got this confirmed.     I myself am still learning, and I am doing it alone, so it may take some time until some videos will be made. I could do it also now but I know I wouldn't be satisfied.      in few days etsy profile will be created      I never was but I guess now is the time. At least for a while.     Thank you very much for such nice words. I don't consider my self any good, I started with watercolours only in autumn 2015 so I guess I would consider myself as someone who's still learning and just trying to figure things out.

FYI I just came here to read comments on the last episode of Sherlock and ended up with this.     be my guest     its Chinese white by WinsorNewton Cotman with a lot of water. The colour is rich in pigment that way it can cover up even dark spaces.     I can give a little advice here. The sky was started with pre-weting the paper with just water, than i added some yellow hue, than a bit of cadmian red and than some blues and darks. After drying that has created the effect. Some trees were painted on 1.wash wet on wet. other were painted during second wash dry on wet. third wash was just few little details with just a touch of brush. and than the birds.     Thank you ! I didn't use any masking fluid. The trees in the background were painted wet on wet and those in front dry on wet that way i got some highlights in the foreground.     After all of this I sure hope I will in a while, just give me a little time please. this all is too overwhelming for me. kind of.      I sure must make an easy account after such an evening I just had, so I would really like to ask people for a bit of patience. I never ever thought that any of my works would catch such an attention. Everything I sell and will sell are original works, no prints. Not yet but if there will be demand why not.
     The paper is Montvall 300g, colours are Umton ( a small Czech family business) and WinsorNewton Cotman     Yes i do.

Thanks. I hope I wont let u down.      Thank you, I myself have started few years ago with oils, they havent worked for me at all, then I moved to acrylics. results were a bit better but i guess that wasnt for me either. Then I moved to watercolors and I sticked to it until now. cant say that everything always goes as planed but it makes me happy, and thats the important part I guess.     to make things easier here are some links:

Etsy will be set up this week, so please be patient.     Now I really hope I will get the possibility to see them in real life. Ill have my fingers crossed.     these are really great! thanks !     actually me too :D     Thank you but i am really not used to this kind of attention and such reactions. Its a brand new feeling for me really.      everything that is right now on instagram and sashe are originals. also when etsy will be set up there will be only originals. but if there will be demand for prints I dont see any reason why not to do it. and thank you for the compliment.     glad I could help     thank you for such kind words and  also thanks for the patience.      right now I work mostly with watercolors and canson paper /so mainly this style and medium/. try the instagram until etsy will be ready. http://instagram.com/continuum_transfunctioner/     Glad I could be helpful.     well first of all I use paper that is suitable for watercolors, I use montvall, fabriano and canson papers which are 200g, 250g, 300g,400g. when you use such heavy paper it will prevent any damage or buckeling, also i use masking tape. but before using the tape try it first if it doesnt rip the paper, since this has happend to me few times and it brings tears into eyes when there is piece of paper torn out with the masking tape.     as I mentioned give me some time please, this all is just too much for me. to be honest I wasnt able to do anything meaningfull today. but I hope etsy will be set this week, so stay tuned and be patient     makes me happy and proud, thank you.     No not ink. Its chines white watercolor in tube. I can send you a link for it if i manage to find it somewhere.      Right now Slovakia only. But this week I will log into etsy to ship internationaly.      In this case for nothing. I just have a really messy table because i need to have everything at reach. Thats all.      right now only a slovak website, but as i promised few people here already this week i will set up etsy to ship internationaly. so be patient please and stay tuned. I never thought of such positive reactions so never really thought of doing etsy n stuff.     Glad i could help.      Thank you     Out of the woods, wtercolor, 2016, 35x50cm     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsiWszjkPcM     by painting in separate washes, to get the foggy feeling you paint wet on wet, to get more details and avoid mixing colors you have to paint wet on dry. but make sure you use the same hues /my opinion/ and the brushes isnt as moist as in the wet on wet stage, more dry, less water, more pigment. hope it helps.     glad to do that     Z     thank you!     After all these reactions I am not sure right now.Not because i would like to get as much money as possible, but because it has created a wonderful memory and has created this amazing feeling i never felt i guess. But I Will create etsy this week with my works, since there are a lot of them everywhere in my flat.     never thought of anything like this. This positive reactions and overwhelming comments are new to me. like new new.     I guess I myself need a little teaching     https://www.instagram.com/continuum_transfunctioner/     this is too kind     will do it this week     hopefully one day     Please wait until I make and etsy account, I never ever thought of such a positive reaction so never really thought of selling international.     i do : https://www.instagram.com/continuum_transfunctioner/     During the first wash where sky and background were created I did some brush strokes in the foreground with just water and bit of pigment. Then during second and third wash I just put paint on the spaces were paint already was. So there were this spaces that were left in the end.     there are many chinese whites in tubes that can be used for this, i use Winsor Newton Cotman, but i know that also Daniel Smith makes these.      you sir have made an amazing work. all thumbs up, pelase keep the good work     no, not this one, it is similiar in terms of topic and colors since it if from a series of winter woods i am working on.     Of corse, I will try to pick the things I learned the hard way.
First of all i guess it is important to use quality tools /meaning colors, paper and brushers/ In terms of paper I use paper made for watercolors, which means it is heavier and can take more water then other papers /usualy these papers are 200g,300g or even hevier/ Then theres the colors I personaly use winsor newton cotman colors in tubes since they I believe it is easier to pick the color from the tube and make some details at the end. Also I find them better to mix. Then dont be that guy who wants to paint everything with every color he/she sees. I am writing this just because i was this guy, and thats no good. The key for me is simplyfing what i am about to paint. Sketch is an important part of the proces, it gives me the idea of light and shadows and in my opinion in watercolors its all about light and shadow, warm and cold spaces and interconnecting them. Also I find it very useful to work with limited color palette. Usually I pick like 2 or 3 primary colors and work with them the whole time, just by mixing other colors into them. This way the outcome will look more compact and work better as a whole. A good thing is masking tape. It is very useful since the paper wont be moving while you paint, but make sure to try it first before painting to find out if it doesnt rip your paper, since it would be a pitty to destroy a nice work after an hour of painting just by taking the tape of. I hope this was for you at least helfpul. If you have any further questions I will be glad to answer them if I can. Good luck with your work and many nice watercolors is what I wish to you.     thank you very much     Glad you like it! Thank you  Out of the Woods, watercolor, 2017       sure, here you go http://instagram.com/continuum_transfunctioner/     thank you     Just made my day!     Well done     To be honest I dont have anything except one book. The books is by  Dougles R. Graves and is caled drawing portraits, That should give you the basic idea. After that I just spent some time at pinterest searching for different styles and works of pencilwork, after that is just about finding the right pictures, with the right light and shadows and after that its just about trying on an on and then finding your styles, what is best for you, sharp or round edges etc. I hope this was at least a little bit helpful, since I myself am a selflearner in terms of drawing, skething and painting, and I am not that good at explaining things I guess.     thank you for your understanding. To avoid any complications or negative outcome I just wanted to ask if you have specific request for the packaging. Usually I ship biger pieces in Tubuses, which means the paper is rolled, since there is problem to find suitable big and safe envilope. But I can check at the post office if they sell also same big and safe envilopes. If not I will have to go in tubus, But please dont worry, all international competitions in watercolor medium take only tubuses, so theres no problem to straighten the paper under the glass after framing.     Thanks for the order, since it is evening here were I live Ill take care of it first thing in the morning? OK?     more can be found at:

Friday in the Park, a4, pencil       No i have not yet but I am strongly considering it. Anyway thank you for your kind comment!  Batsy and Joker    Autumn in the mountains, 20x50, watercolor       thank you     Sure     Thank you      Thank you     I have actually. Few times. But I dont have the money to get a nice camera. On the other hand i have a nice old minolta which i would like to try but its not working and I cant find anyone near who would be able to repair it.      Actually many people think the same since its what they know from school or art class but master quality watercolor usually comes in tubes.      I sure will. Thank you.      Yes I do. I jave an etsy shop. The link is somewhere in the comments     Theres also a song by ""Foals"" titled ""out of the woods""     Thank you very much!     Thank you for the comment. I have made etsy shop this week so theres no problem to ship to the US.      https://www.etsy.com/shop/ContinuumWatercolors?ref=hdr_shop_menu
Here. Theres not much there yet. So if you dont find what you are looking for from the instagram just message me and i will add it there if its available.      Thank you!     He is the best for me. The way he plays with lights and shadows is just amazing. And all the people he puts in his paintings...pure awesomness     Its no mastery, to see the real mastery please google Joseph Zbukvic watercolors, that man is a genius, like for real. I am using watercolors since autumn 2015, so still learning, and trying to find whats right for me.     whats wrong with acid?      Makes me proud, I will try to put smaller prices on smaller paintings that way it shouldnt be a problem for you in near future, in my opinion its just a pitty that the international shipping from Slovakia costs so much.     I see no reason why not, we have etsy for that, dont we ?     no problem     for corrections of wrong sketching, I need a detailed sketch everytime, so not only to erase wrong pencil marks but also to make the rest not so visible     Well on the left theres chinese white in tube. Technical pencil. Rubber and a cap from hand made bottle.      Two brushes. The small blue one is synthetic and the bigger one made of squirrel hair. The painting was done with just these two brushes. Than theres a black marker and in the upper right its the masking tape.      Yes through etsy. The link is somewhere in the thread     no problem at all, as I said what ever works for you better, and thank you for the compliment.     well for me it is easier to do it without etsy because I am not yet familiar with how it works,/dont want to sound stupid or dumb/ since i have some orders there already, and they are beeing procesed and so on. There was one guy andrew who wanted few pieces like you. He sent me and email with his request, we discused yesterday evening payment and shipping, and his paintings will be on their way tomorrow morning, while I will be waiting for etsy to end order processing. But it is up to you, which ever is better for you works for me too.      I do, i have opened etsy shop yesterday but there isnt much there yet, so if you dont find what youre looking for from my instag. just write me and if it is available i can put it there in no time.
https://www.etsy.com/shop/ContinuumWatercolors?ref=hdr_shop_menu     thank you     Glad you like it     Makes me happy when my work gives someone reason to paint     Go ahead I will keep my fingers crossed for you. Hope it will go well!      Thank you very much. There isnt much on etsy so if you find anything you like on my instagram just let me know. If it is available i can put it right there. Also we can discuss price shipping etc. i am open to such comunication at any time.      Thank you     No problem at all.      All right will try. And dont worry about me forgeting you or this conversation.      Thank you, well I have been drawing things since I can remember, I was that kind of a child that draws on everything, anytime and anywhere. But I am painting with watercolors since autumn 2015.     I guess we are not that different, I went actually to art school, but it was when i was about 6years old and finished it at about beeing12. Cant say I have learned anything since a corse one day a week isnt sufficient and can not teach you a thing when you have to do something completely different each course. I will try to post things regularly if they will be worth mentioning, comments like this give em really fuel into continuing painting     your comment has made my heart all warm and happy, thank you for such a comment.     a lot of it is. I have made an etsy shop this week since there has been a great demand for paintings lately. All of my work can be found on instagram : https://www.instagram.com/continuum_transfunctioner/
etsy: https://www.etsy.com/shop/ContinuumWatercolors?ref=hdr_shop_menu
there isnt much on etsy yet, so if you find andything on the instagram you like and it isnt on etsy just write me an email /majercak.martin@gmail.com/ I can check the availibility and we can discuss further things.     Thank you for such kind words. The thing is that I have started painting without any courses or lessons, then i have read a book about watercolors by the great Joseph Zbukvic and have purchased few videos by him and Alvaro Castagnet and only after that have I found out what I was doing wrong and what could be done better. After that I realised that it can be about someones talent but I guess its mainly about practice and knowledge of the technic and mediums you use, and since this has helped me great I guess it is only natural to pass these information on and on, since it doesnt take much to make the work look better in few little tricks. And as fellow artists we should push each other forward, give relevant critic and usefull tips.     thank you     thank you, hope to see nice comments when the series change :D     oh no i am not really, just trying to draw or paint something everyday to move forward and get step by step better, i guess thats the key to mastering anything      Thanks  cabin in the Woods, watercolor, 30x40cm       Thanks for the feedback. First of all I wouldnt call this my comfort zone. Yo dont know whats comfortable for me to draw and paint is and what is not.  Secondly there are people who are asking for these and thats why there are still coming. And the last thing is that i dont see anything wrong in doing same things over and over in art at all. I dont want to compare anything but look at cezane and his Mont Sainte-Victoire which he made like 20 times at least, which we know about.     thank you  Snowy afternoon, watercolor, 30x40cm       Thanks     Thats what i am going after in these so thank you. Glad you like it.      Well it was worth it  Michalska Veza in Bratislava       when u mentioned Watchmen, I can see it there now, anyway great job     this looks truly great. must have been hard as hell. great job  In the Woods       Truly amazing     Reminds me of Roy Lichtenstein I guess thats what u were going for     All right than. Thank you.      Of corse you can, it just takes time and practice, I guess if you stick with it long enough you will outgrow this piece     its all watercolor and it started as a sketch made with pencil     glad to hear that     This sums up my monday. Thanks.      Go get 'em     Looks like this winter is going to be the one with most frozen things caught on camera     Yolo     Thinking out of the box level master.      Anything by Bill Evans.      Come to Slovakia anytime, but especialy in winter. There are many beautiful spots in here(mountains,caves, old castles and old small towns) just not many peple know abou it. Since our government doesnt know that turism can be good for economy I guess.   Bojnice castle, watercolor, 30x50cm       This is pure genius. Love it.      No its not since it is quite cold in here. Its made according a photograph.      here https://www.instagram.com/continuum_transfunctioner/     No thank you.      Few people mentioned this same thing about my two other pieces here and this time I was actually going after that. So I am glad it kind of worked. Bill Watterson is a big influence. Until now it was more about the philosohpy of the graphic novel. Lately it bacame about the art as well.      Thank you     epic     Yes. During the first wash i use a lot of water and a lot of pigment. During the second wash i use less water but still lot of pigment and the third wash which are just details like branches grass or bords i only pick the pigment with as little water as possible     I always admire these oil paintings with water theme     This is brilliant     Thank you     Thank you for such a nice comment. But i dont consider myself talented. I believe its all abou practice. I personaly have to draw sketch or paint every single day because if I dont I can feel the difference after a painting break. So I believe even though I dont know you that you are also capable of such paintings. You just have to be patient and try. But not too hard. Results will sure come. Not after a week or month. But once in while when you look back you will see it.      To male the sketch not so visible before first wash   Into the Unknown, Watercolor, 30x40 cm       I am really glad you like what I do. The pronouncing will be a bit hard for most of the people as I learned through the years, but this can help https://translate.google.com/#sk/en/majerk  Winter in the Mountains, watercolor, 30x40cm       You are absolutly right. The goal should be to push eqch other forward with constructional critic and well placed advices like this. I sure will try it next time I will be doing something similiar to thos. Thank you wOut!     This is really valuable. Will try it next time. To be honest I was kind of scared painting this since its not something that I am used to doing and I didnt want to over-do it.      Well done. Really love the sky!     You just did it again! Excelent my friend!  Behind the window. Watercolor. 30x40cm.       Thank you.      This is so beautiful. Would also like to see more. Great job. Keep it up!  Solitude in the mountains. Watercolor. 21x31cm.       Glad u like it.      10. If you want to critique a post, be constructive and follow Reddiquette.	Don't engage in personal attacks, hate speech or racism, and do not complain about downvotes.     I dont see no frame anywhere but OK. You obviously know better.      Actually thank you for submitting such a great work.      Well its not bout trees and mountains all. There are many different subjects from cityscapes and landscapes.   St. Egidius Church, watercolor, 21x31 cm       I have bought one of them on vimeo last autumn, Rural France, really great stuff     I know its not a contest, its just that I really admire people who can paint the way you do. Your horses remind me of those painted by Joseph Zbukvic, and in my opinion more credits should go to people who can paint like that.     This sounds really great, cant wait to see it come to life. I wish you best of luck.     thank you, but this is no match to what you are doing     You should stick to it. In my opinion I have seen only three horses made by you but I really love them. It all seems so life like. Well done sir. Well done. 
If I can add something I would really love to see some paintings with more horses racing.      I really love your horses, great stuff man     this is truly great     great use of color, well painted, thumbs up sir     Well u can follow me on instagram if you'd like even though its not reddit.      No their not since we are having very wet and cold winter this year     well done, nice use of colors     Sharp edges were what I was going after.      Gar kein Problem.      yes I do, last week two packages went to Munchen. Also es ist gar kein problem fur mich     First of all thank you. I already sell them, not all of em but a lot, some of my stuff can be found on etsy /https://www.etsy.com/shop/ContinuumWatercolors?ref=hdr_shop_menu/ but if you didnt find there what u were looking for just message me, if that piece youre looking for is available I can put it on etsy for purchase anytime.     Thanks. If you'll have more questions about anything dont hesitate.      Theres nothing noob about this questions. There were times when I had the same questions but noone to ask. So had to figure it out myself. In this case the first was put the sunset. So the reds and yellows. In the sky and i put few brush strokes on spots where forest would later appear. During the same wash i made some marks on snow shade. Then came the cabin and then the forest.      Once again thank you, such comments motivate me into more painting.     No it is not, there are so many great watercolor artist that do far better stuff than I will ever do. Really. And dont take this that way that I am saying this to hear more ego stroking things, but because of the credit that I believe deserve people like Zbukvic, Castagnet, Tanabe, Jasiewicz, Gorean and many more     Thank you, but I dont do prints right now, but I guess I will have start with it in the near future.     Glad u like it.      Thank u so much. Makes me proud.       I am glad you do  Budmerice Castle, Watercolor, 30x40cm       Thank you  Prague, Watercolour, 30x40cm       I am not sure i have put it here on the 20.1.17. The only time on r/art.

I'm saying this is for people who are unable to download something because their internet sucks or whatever reason they have, and its better than having to upload a  copy of the file again as you can just close the tab and just let it do its thing, it also makes it easier to fill in requests for files which have been previously removed.       I really want Filipino (Tagalog) please!      Thank you so much!!!      Oh, thanks anyway      I remember someone uploaded a discography of Wu Tang Clan but I can't find the post anymore, can someone help please.      Hey, I don't know how many of these requests get filled so maybe if you want, I have Kung Fu Panda 3, but at 720p and its approx 750 mbs (and... I know its probably not the best for showing in front of friends or something but its watchable if you're alone, again not sure how many of the requests get filled)...and its on Dropbox. Now I could transfer it over to Mega but its going to have to be overnight so you're going to have to wait about 12 hours. But anyways here's the Dropbox link if you really want it immediately 
http://www.URLBiggy.com/Hey/SorryItsnotamegalink      Here's the MEGA link http://www.URLBitty.com/1W5tX      I really only expect 4 people to want this so the pswrd is included in the link.   [META] Here's a way to backup files to other cloud drives so you won't lose them permanently.  Hey, I should have probably posted this sooner but I never got around to it. I dont post anything so I have no idea how this works but basically this is basically about MEGA link takedowns and how you can kinda save the file before it gets lost to removed. Also saving the hassle of submitters who lose their uploads.   

Theres a site called [Multcloud](https://www.multcloud.com/) It allows you to send files to yourself on other cloud platforms. 

For example you have a Dropbox account (I have 50gbs on my dropbox account but normal users have 2.5 gbs :( , but dont worry theres plenty of other clouds that also work with it) and you want to download say a movie but its a bit too big say 10 gbs (really hate encountering a movie I want thats over 5gbs, but hey its free, can people please maybe separate them into 1gb files, not everyone has great internet speed, or maybe its just us Australians with crappy internet speed) 

Back on track again, say your internet is too slow or the place you are in say a library doesnt have great internet speed and you really want the file but you cant download it cos youre in a library and its illegal (its illegal at home as well...I think). Well guess what you can now copy it to another cloud and then copy it back when you can finally downloading it. 

It takes about an hour per gb(for me), but if you do it overnight you cant even tell.

I really suggest someone getting a Baidu account, there was a promotion or something going on last year where you could get a 1TB account for free if you signed up or something last year, never got around to it as I was too lazy, even now Im avoiding work by typing this up :( 

Back on topic by getting a Baidu account you can copy movies from MEGA over to Baidu so you have a backup copy of it even if it gets taken down. And also! It makes the request thread easier to fill if they want past movies that have been taken down. Annnnnnd also it saves the submitters time if it gets taken down, so all they would have to do is copy the file from Baidu back into MEGA and whoalah the file is back on Mega and the request can be filled. 

P.S I really feel like there should be more likes on posts, like this subreddit has 31, 404 people and theres only 12 upvotes? What? Im sure theres more way more people who downloaded the file. But idk nvm whocares, the OP does thats who, right?

tl;dr Theres meant to be some kinda tl;dr thing right, which sums all the stuff up with less waffle.
MultCloud which allows you to backup files to other cloud drives and move files around to other cloud drives. [Multcloud](https://www.multcloud.com/)

Want to save MEGA files online?
1. Connect another service to multcloud
2. Move files back and forth.
3. Voil

Thank you /u/TheGoodSheep for telling me to shorten the article.

Im sorry for all the waffling ( i'll edit it maybe) but since this isnt summative for school, I typed out my thoughts as well. 3

subject366,"    The thing about finding people to test is that I require honesty, so typically I ask close friends and people I know professionally.  I respect the opinion of a small number of very experienced people over 100 noobs.  In fact, the reviews of most vibrators are almost all 5 stars.  It isn't hard to give a mediocre vibrator a great review if it is your first one.  Vibrators are like bacon, even a bad one is still pretty great.  
     Hi, 

I would like to get on the calendar on Tuesday April 23rd at 9:30 PM EST.  I will stay on for two hours to try to answer all of the questions.  

My proof is located here:
http://www.priveco.com/tomnarpresis.html

You can see the second paragraph discusses my planned AMA.    AMA - Vibrators.com and ShopInPrivate.com CEO Tom Nardone  [removed]     I'm sorry to take so long to reply. I am new to Reddit and didn't figure it out.
In our office, it would be no big deal.  It can be difficult to find a company that will work with you though because some folks are afraid to put adult products into their work environment.  We had a difficult time finding a company to make us lollipops for Bachelorette.com.       I'm sorry to take so long to reply. I am new to Reddit and didn't figure it out.

There is a company that makes wood toys, but I'm not a fan of the material because it can harbor bacteria.  They are called Nob Essence (nob, ha!)     I'm sorry to take so long to reply. I am new to Reddit and didn't figure it out.
I've met the folks at TSX, they are very nice people who understand that most of what they make is novelty items. They are really sweet people though.  I've know about Bad-Dragon but I have never met anyone from the company.  Their site creeps me out a little bit and I'm pretty thick-skinned.       Thanks for writing.  Women do much of the sculpting.  Most I've worked with are not supermodels.  They use the protoypes to make production molds.  It isn't really as sexy as it sounds.  Most new items aren't really ground breaking.  There are thousands of different products in the marketplace.       I'll see if we can encode a better quality one.  Thanks for the compliment and the advice.       I'm sorry to take so long to reply. I am new to Reddit and didn't figure it out.

I'll try to answer it all:
Yes. 
Yes.
There are many wireless toys on the market.  There is even one that sells on our site for less than $20.  http://www.vibrators.com/waterproof-remote-control-bullet.html
None of them have any security measures built in.  I'm not sure the customer cares.  What harm would it cause if one of them were hacked?  Drained batteries?
There are trade shows were manufacturers meet with retailers, etc.  
It is a weird business.  It is sorta fun too.  Thanks for asking.     I'm sorry to take so long to reply. I am new to Reddit and didn't figure it out.

I am going to schedule an AMA soon.  I'm still sorta figuring it all out.     I'm sorry to take so long to reply. I am new to Reddit and didn't figure it out.

I'm more of a vibrationist.     I'm sorry to take so long to reply. I am new to Reddit and didn't figure it out.

Bad-Dragon.com is sure an interesting company.       I'm sorry to take so long to reply. I am new to Reddit and didn't figure it out.

The designs end up fairly easy to smooth out.  Also, as the printer resolutions get better, the same digital design will produce a smoother product.  

Thanks for writing.     I'm sorry to take so long to reply. I am new to Reddit and didn't figure it out.

There is no way out of this business.  Once you entered our industry, you could never find work anywhere else.  You would do better to try to get experience elsewhere and then enter the adult products business as the boss of a company.  

I hope that is good advice.     I'm sorry to take so long to reply. I am new to Reddit and didn't figure it out.

I started an online store that sold embarrassing drugstore items in 1998.  ShopInPrivate.com launched about 6 months prior to any other online drugstores and was sorta successful.  We promised total privacy and people used that privacy to buy sex toys.  Soon thereafter Drugstore.com, CVS.com and Walgreens.com launched and we had to make money, so we were happy to privately sell sex toys.  Eventually we acquired the Vibrators.com business and we also own Bachelorette.com (bachelorette party supplies).

They do, although I don't think they are a major player in the industry.       Thanks for the offer.  Sorry I took so long to reply.  I wasn't up to speed on Reddit.     I apologize for taking so long to reply.  You are very welcome.     First, I apologize for taking a long time to answer you question. Here goes..

Dildos are generally thicker than vibrators because dildos are purchased to feel penetration.  Women (and men) who want vibration don't usually need the thickness.  There are exceptions to this, but in general dildos are sold thicker and with deeper ridges than vibes.  

It sounds like you might actually enjoy a realistic vibrator more.  http://www.vibrators.com/real.html  Personally, I don't understand why people don't buy more vibrators and fewer dildos, but you some folks like the term dildo, like person who started this thread.  He could have called it Vibrator Engineer.

Finally, Silicone is the current material of choice for well-researched individuals due to its lack of porosity and ease of keeping sanitary.  

They make a couple of squirting dildos.

This is me:  If I were lying, I would pick someone more handsome.  http://www.priveco.com/tomnarpresis.html

tom@priveco.com     First, I apologize for taking a long time to answer you question. Here goes

Most toys are still sculpted in clay and then cast from there.  Sometimes they use a live person, but even those molds are worked over, especially the female ones.       First, I apologize for taking a long time to answer you question.  Here goes:

I think the industry is shrinking away from highly controllable motors because the customer has largely ignored them.  Customers don't seem to enjoy a large number of functions, nor programability.  Also, when using an adult toy, there is very little way to see what you are doing.  The controls need to be operable blind.  Companies are moving back toward keeping it simple and i think we will find a continued push toward this.  

Companies like Smitten Kitten and other boutique retailers are more a reaction of the changing gender of the buyers over the last 20 years.  Women now buy the toys and they aren't afraid to spend a large amount on them.  Retailers with a female bent have sprouted up to fill the need.  

I'm not aware of any wireless standards for the wireless toys.  I suspect that the manufacturers of such just piggyback off of some other existing technologies.  I suppose we will continue to see that in the future.  I doubt anyone will find some great need in sex toys which will require a unified wireless standard.  Mostly, they are just turned on and off.       IAMA Dildo/Vibrators Engineer.  My name is Tom Nardone and I run subject366 Inc.  We own and operate Vibrators.com.  In the past I worked for Sikorsky Aircraft a helicopter company as well as Ford Motor Company.  You can find out more about me at subject366.com.  Here are your answers:
1.  Most dildo molds have been around a while.  Early ones were usually cast from clay sculptures, but some were made from famous dudes' junk.  These days prototypes are done on 3D printers and then the molds are made from there.
2.  I usually don't lead with my profession, but I don't lie about it either. It doesn't hurt that I own the company, so I've been fairly successful.  It would be tough to explain why I did what I do if it didn't pay well.
3.  Dildos and vibrators materials have come a long way.  Silicone is really popular these days because it is the safest materials, but dildos are made from latex rubber, elastomers, glass, pyrex, ABS plastic, wood, stainless steel.  You name it.
4.  There is a company out there called TSX (I believe) that makes all sorts of animal dildos and stuff.  They make the weirdest things I've ever seen.  Giant stuff like horse dongs.  
5.  Dildo designers usually do pocket pussies and artificial vaginas as well.  Fleshlight is one brand of those.  

What does the future hold?  We are all working with 3D printers to do prototypes now, and when they are available in peoples' homes, I imagine that people will print their own sex toys.  MakerLove.com is a project that a couple of people are working on to provide free dildo designs for your 3D printer.  

There you go.        5000 square feet isn't enough to influence anyone politically, so I think he won't get any subsidies.  Also, he won't be creating any jobs, so you won't find much interest in helping him tax wise.  

The issue with being inside the city is that the police don't want to spend their time following up on property crime, so when your shop is broken into, they won't help catch the person who did the crime.  This will effect your insurance rates and may cause all of those toys to disappear.  Someplace outside the city will get better services for not much more money.  If you are north of the city try Warren, Hazel Park, if West try Westland, Inkster, Dearborn Heights, etc.  The difference a few blocks makes in distance is enormous in city services.   Neiman Marcus sells a pair of ""distressed"" sneakers for $1,425. I wonder how they smell.       We'll see what the weather brings.  Sandy soil, dirt, puddles, not too much rocky stuff.  If there is a lot of rain we'll see lots of mud, if not, just dirt.       Love it!  You should think about entering a Gambler 500 event if one is anywhere near you.  They are on/off road rallies for $500 cars.  Your Fiero would be a great choice.      Thanks!  I posted some more photos on the Detroit Gambler page here:  https://www.facebook.com/detroitgambler500/posts/409094682822507     That's pretty cool.  Around here 2000 mustangs aren't real popular and explorers are everywhere, so why not combine them?  I like the 4x4 decal.      Here in the Detroit area it isn't too hard to find running cars for $500, they are all on Craigslist.  This one had its share of problems.  It had been rear-ended so the body has some wrinkles and the rear bumper cover was all cracked and dangling.  The rest of the body has some decent visible rust spots too.  The trunk didn't open and the driver's door pins were so worn that you couldn't get the door to close.  I repaired the cracked rear bumper with hunks of wood and some screws.  I replaced the door pins, which only cost $12 but took about 7 hours of labor.  That job was a serious pain the butt.  I'll probably grind and bondo the rust spots too.  So, it's possible to find a good $500 donor car, especially if you are patient and can do some work.     I could only do so much with my budget.       I just finished the build, so I've only put less than 100 miles on it as is.  Before I take it off road I am gradually taking the tires up to higher and higher speeds.  They were a bit age-cracked when I got them, so I am worried.  In two weeks it'll hit the trails.  For now I've been playing in dirt lots and driving over curbs.  Before the Gambler I'll also weld up the rear differential to get 2 wheel drive.
     The $500 thing is a suggestion.  The grand champion of the event is the person that completes the entire rally with the shittiest car, so spending more ensures you lose.       Thanks!  So far I've bartered for a bunch of stuff (the tires and the installation of the tires).  Including electronics, fixing the car, and suspension parts I'm right around $1,000.  Before I put the tires on it was fun to drive, but honestly they are too noisy so it isn't much fun to tool around in.       Thanks.  Those are stock mustang wheels.  I never liked them with the skinny stock tires, but I love them with the mud tires.  They were also in my budget because they came with the car.  15"" wheels are not too hard to find mud tires for. 

It didn't take much suspension work.  I started with a v6 mustang which had tires that were way too small.  I wanted tires that were the same width as those on a Cobra, but with my budget I could only find some that were a little bit bigger.  (I wanted 29x10 but got 31x10.5).  That meant I had to lift it a bit.  I but a 1.25"" lift spacer in the back, it was just and aluminum puck and caused about a 2.5"" lift.  I also put in new, slightly longer, air assisted shocks in the back.  (monroe hi-jackers).  That installation wasn't tough.  For the front I put in 3/4 in. spacers, which were good for about 1 1/2 inches of lift.  The front spacers were a complete pain in the neck to install.  The stock springs (I kept them all) were already fairly long in the front, so to get the spacer in, I had to use a spring compressor that I needed to cut down in length, as well as use a special mustang spring installation tool.  That took me a while to get right.  It's now about 10"" to the bottom of the weld flange of the body.  It also seems to have a better stance.  These mustangs seem to naturally squat rearward, which I don't care for.      It is a v6, you can't get a GT for $500.  I am avoiding the roof rack by just bolting stuff to the roof.  The spare is mounted and the fake machine gun, for the Gambler I will be toting a chain saw and possibly a shovel.  I'll be making mounts for each of them out of some scrap wood.  I'll use the ""Screw it right through the roof"" method of installation.

It comes complete with potato, vegetable or salad, and yorkshire pudding (sometimes called a popover).  They offer three sizes, I think the small one is $17.95.  A lot of people go to Red Coat for the burgers, but the prime rib is excellent.  They offer it every night.      Hi!  I'm just reminding you that persistence does pay off.  I hope all is well.    I'm in a race against time! I've got to eat all of these holiday cookies!    If necessity is the mother of invention, laziness is probably the father.       There you go!  It is definitely time to dust it off.     I tried to put some thoughts into this, so that I would give you a good reply.  This is my best shot PrivilegeCheckmate.  

My personal experience is that if you can keep a project moving forward, every day, you will eventually accomplish something.  Sounds kinda over-simplified, but I swear by it.  

No matter what the project is, you have to keep it moving forward every day.  It might be leaps and bounds, it might be a small step, it might even be a slow crawl after the project has been set back significantly, but you (or me) as the person leading the project has to make sure that you move forward every, single day.  

You have to do this with one project.  The other projects can play around on the sidelines, but one project has to move forward every day.  

You mentioned that you have a million ideas, so how do you choose?  I start by discussing all of the ideas with the smartest, most successful friends I have.  I find that successful people love to talk about ideas, and they can help you figure out which ones have potential and which are duds.  I have always tried to choose the best, or my favorite idea, and kick it down the road daily.

My personal mantra has been the same for 17 years now.  ""Every day I move forward."" 

That was a hard question to answer.  It took most of my morning to write write and it still seems stupid.          If you live in the area near our warehouse, which is in Troy, Michigan you should send in your resume.  At least we know that you can use the Internet, although you capitalization needs a little sprucing up.       The other day a sex shop worked did an AMA and she said that the brick and mortar store that she worked in served predominantly men.  I think this is fairly common in the industry.  Traditional retail locations serve more men, online sex toy stores serve more women.  It seems to make some sense.     I have a minute so I wanted to preach a little more.  The thing about companies that make expensive vibrators is that they have lots of people on staff that tell you how great they are, but lower priced vibes can often be just as good or better.  Don't get me wrong, I like LELO toys and they score really well on our in house test, but some brands that cost a fortune do not.  There is a product called the Little Chroma that costs $125 and is outscored by another vibe called The PleasureCraft that sells for $30.  
     I actually started an online shop that was totally private and people could be free to buy anything they wanted or needed in total privacy.  It all started with hemorrhoid creams, Depends, and condoms actually, but once people found out about the privacy, mostly they just wanted to buy sex toys.  I'm happy to sell them.  The drugstore business was really difficult.  There are a million, nice, inviting, convenient drugstores to shop within.  There are very few nice sex toy retailers.  It's easier in life to have weaker competitors.  
     My first idea was to start a website where people could buy embarrassing things.  It is called ShopInPrivate.com.  It began as a place to buy hemorrhoid cream in total privacy and it worked.  But once we started offering totally private shopping, all of the customers wanted vibrators!  Eventually, the ShopInPrivate.com business acquired the Vibrators.com business, so now I run both, but for REDDIT's sake I skipped the ShopInPrivate.com in the title.  It's been a fun ride. 

I think peopel who have known me for a while are kinda impressed with how it has gone, but it is tough to meet someone new and explain what I do.  People jump to all sorts of conclusions.     I posted this above:  I know people like to see proof, so I posted something on our corporate page about me doing an AMA today. Here is a link: http://www.priveco.com/tomnarpresis.html
That is my picture although my teeth aren't that white and I have a couple of more wrinkles than that. Also, I almost never wear a suit.     We actually have a vibration measurement machine and a sound measurement device as well.  It might be less exciting than you think.  We also have a small group of advisors that tests them in a romantic sorta way, but the majority of the work is more scientific.  

The Hitachi Magic wand has been a top seller for the 14 years I've been in the business.  It's the ""old reliable"" of the sex toy business.  You should try it sometime.     We go about 60% female based upon identifiable first names. People like K.C. you cannot tell and some names aren't recognizable.  We don't ask gender but we do sorta want to know how we are scoring.  It is important to us to be female safe.       Thanks for asking.  We like vibes that are three things:  Body safe, quiet, and powerful and we test them to find out.  Our best seller right now is called the Romance because it is all three and it isn't too expensive at $35.  http://www.vibrators.com/lamour-romance-vibrator.html

Rechargeable vibes are nice too, but they generally cost a lot more to get that one feature, so I'm cool without it.       I know people like to see proof, so I posted something on our corporate page about me doing an AMA today.  Here is a link:

That is my picture although my teeth aren't that white and I have a couple of more wrinkles than that.  Also, I almost never wear a suit.  AMA - Vibrators.com Founder/President Tom Nardone  Feel free to ask me anything about the sex toy business.  I'll try to be good natured, funny, and willing to discuss just about anything having to do with my company.  In the 14 years I've been selling vibrators and other weird stuff online I have seen a lot.  

OK folks, it is after midnight now, I'm going to go to sleep now.  I'll log on tomorrow and answer more questions if you want to leave them.  Thanks for asking questions and for reading my AMA.  I hope it was interesting.     I apologize that I took so long to figure this all out.  I am doing an AMA next Tuesday night April 23rd.  I hope you will ask me something.      I apologize that I took so long to figure this all out.  I am doing an AMA next Tuesday night April 23rd.  I hope you will ask me something.      I apologize that I took so long to figure this all out.  I am doing an AMA next Tuesday night April 23rd.  I hope you will ask me something. 

People choose all sorts of different shapes, although phallic usually sells best.  I guest nature is pretty powerful.     I apologize that I took so long to figure this all out.  I am doing an AMA next Tuesday night April 23rd.  I hope you will ask me something.       You don't have to be embarrassed to buy an adult product.  There are plenty of stores where you can buy one in public.  Online there are tons of sites that will sell you one and then email you every week for the rest of your natural life.  Some people just prefer to buy a product from a company that doesn't share or use their personal info and works hard to keep the whole thing private.  That's us.  

But honestly, the thread is Ask Me Anything, not ask me to pitch you my company.  This is supposed to be sorta fun and funny, a chance to get an inside look at an unusual company.  

I'll be back on Tuesday night to field questions.  Talk to you then and I won't forget about you...     Me too.  I guess we are done then or are you going to have the last word?     My career developed slowly as my company transitioned from just ShopInPrivate.com to Bachelorette.com and then when we acquired Vibrators.com I started to be known more for toys.  

The most awkward moment was one time when I was driving our company van which had a ""Bachelorette.com"" logo on it.  I was filling it with gas and a car full of women approached me and asked ""how much do you charge?"" and I said ""for what?"" and they said ""To take off your clothes!""  I paused and looked at them for a second and said ""Miss, I don't think anyone wants to see me without my clothes...""       I started an online store that sells embarrassing items in 1998 and then just kept selling items people wanted to buy privately.  It's been a weird ride but I think we are still a very unique company and offer a valuable, private service.       I wouldn't use anything that doesn't have FDA approval.  I'm not much of a condom user (wife and 3 kids) but the ones with the swirl at the tip are much better.  Is there a reason to stray from Trojan brand?     Then don't reply...     That's a great product idea!  We will add it to the list!  Dr. Jerky's Keyboard Cleaner or something like that.     Oh man, I shot a video once of me removing my back hair.  It now has 144,000 views.  Ick!

      If you can get the surface quality up to the level of nJoy toys there might be a chance.  My advice would be to first find a single shape that really resonates with people, get the surface finish up to the highest standards, and contact me.  My email is tom at priveco dot com.  
Here is a link to the 6 nJoy pieces we sell.  The photos are not manipulated either.  We shoot them in house and their finish is THAT GOOD.
http://www.vibrators.com/nsearch.html?catalog=vibrators-dot-com x=0 y=0 query=njoy     We don't sell cat food, yarn balls, litter boxes, or that sort of thing.  Do you think that the cats could live on edible lubricant and play with a feather tickler?     A few important things:
1.  We have never had an email newsletter.  Never.  So once you shop with us we just ship your parcel and then never bother you again.  I think that is the most important thing.  
2.  We do all of our own shipping in house.  Other sex toy stores use drop shippers and thus share your information.  We keep all of your data under one roof where I can be sure it is confidential. 
3.  We use plain brown shipping boxes and ultra secure tape (but a lot of sites do that).
4.  We offer a service called Double Layer privacy.  For $0.99 more we heat seal the contents of your order in a black plastic bag and then put that inside your secure package.  That way if someone gets nosey and opens the box, they still won't know what is up.  
5.  We make shopping on the site quick and easy.  We filter through all of the products in our industry and only sell the best, that way you can shop quickly and be sure that you'll get a great product.  

Here's a little video that sums it all up.  BTW our company is called subject366 (like private and company squashed together).  It is a big focus for us.  
http://www.vibrators.com/adques.html

Thanks for asking.  If anything, the privacy of the site is my life's work.     Vibrators.com really isn't the place for those consumers.  We are sort of a friendly, understandable shop for women.  Our customers don't seem as interested in size as they are power.  

Here is an example of a HUGE vibrator.  It is called the Great American Challenge (people have posted about it on REDDIT before)  http://www.vibrators.com/world-s-biggest-vibrator.html  We sold only around 50 of them last year.  

This is our most slender vibrator.  It is barely thicker than a AA battery and was designed to be as slim as possible.  We sold hundreds of these.  http://www.vibrators.com/oasis-intimates-slim-vibe.html

Our customers like powerful toys though regardless of the toy's size they like power.  The best way to predict if a toy is going to be successful on our site is to measure how strongly it vibrates, so we do.  .  We sell a bunch of Hitachi Magic Wands and Sybians which are really, really powerful.

Great question.  I'm glad you asked.      Over the years people have introduced some really strange products into our industry.  I have to admit that some of the folks in the sex toys business are a bit weird (probably myself included) but these products seem to really take weird to a whole new level.  Here is a short list:

Beer Flavored Lubricant - Yup, personal lubricant that was flavored like different kind of beer.  It smelled an tasted like the morning after a frat party.  Ick!  Here's a photo from Flickr http://www.flickr.com/photos/thebookpolice/3265291763/

Hommemystere - Women's underwear for men.  The website is priceless:  http://hommemystere.com/

The Cock Pipe - A device that contains burning stuff that you strap to your penis.  http://cockpipe.xxx/

A stripper shoe with a pocket pussy build into the platform, and all sorts of other stuff.     Someone in the office once said ""I've measured so many dongs that if a flasher every exposed himself to me I could tell the cops ""It was 6 3/8"" long with a circumference of 2.75"""".     People in the office were talking about this product today.  It's supposed to boost your testosterone.  http://www.shopinprivate.com/on-testosterone-cream.html

We are looking to find the next pill.  So far we have only found duds.  In the 14 years I've been selling these items, there have been a number of FDA crackdowns on different pills.  What happens is that after the crackdown all of the pills stop working for a while, then a few months later they will suddenly and mysteriously start becoming more effective.       We used to offer a ""no invoice"" service but not for that reason.  It was popular among international customers so that they could avoid paying import taxes on the merchandise they ordered.  

Eventually we stopped when we realized that people could use it for the wrong reason.  It got too murky for us.  Sending anonymous sex toys to people seemed a little too close to harrassment.  

We want to offer a really private service and we offer a few things that no one else offers, but that process had to stop.  Here is one thing we do to ensure privacy.  It's called Double Layer Privacy and we invented in our company.  http://www.vibrators.com/ulprivdel.html

Thats me in the videos (the dude).       One thing that sometimes brightens my day is that our lead customer service guy sits outside my office and I can hear what he says if I pay attention.  He is quite charming in a sorta blunt way that I enjoy.  One day he was talking to someone and he said.  ""Well, technically its not the largest vibrator, we have others but that is the largest one a human being would use.""  That cracked me up.     Yup.  Unfortunately, they usually work by cheating.  Although the package will usually say they contain things like Ginseng or Ginger root, the companies that make them ""spike"" them with synthetic ingredients like generic viagra.  Here is a recent FDA notice about a pill called Rock It Man.  The FDA visited our office over it.  They wanted to know who made it and how to contact them.  We cooperated with the process and had to destroy our inventory of the pills.  http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/BuyingUsingMedicineSafely/MedicationHealthFraud/ucm344806.htm     We sell a bunch of different anal bleaching creams on ShopInPrivate.com and the reviews are positive.  The same products have been used to treat liver-spots and skin blemishes for decades.  

Are they safe?  Many of the products use Hydroquinone, which the FDA says is OK but some European countries do not allow.  If you want to avoid Hydroquinone, this is the best choice:
http://www.shopinprivate.com/dr-pinks-anal-bleaching-cream.html
The same product is sold in ""spa packaging"" under the name Biofade and made by the same company but if you buy the Biofade brand it costs $20 more.  Check it out here: http://www.shopinprivate.com/biofade-anal-nipple-vulva-bleach.html  

I'm happy to answer the question, but I think I just outed myself as an expert on anal bleaching creams.       People say funny things to me to:  I worked a trade show where our company was looking for partner websites where we could advertise. While speaking to one group of women, I mentioned that I run Bachelorette.com, ShopInPrivate.com and I said ""I also run Vibrators.com, I guess someone has to, at least I do so professionally."" to which one of the women said ""I thought you'd be shorter."" Ha ha ha... That cracked me up because I'm not tall, but I might be the tallest person in my industry.  All of the guys are vertically challenged.       A lot of the humor in our office is word play.  A few weeks ago were were testing out boner pills to see if they actually do anything.  We were looking for volunteer employees to try them at home.  One guy said ""I'm petrified of those things"" to which another person said ""My wood is petrified from these things.""  I love working here.     Funny Stories:
I apologize that these will be responses to questions that no one has asked but I'm sitting here in my office with nothing to do.  I'll post them as replies to this message.       You are v",0

call me Capitalism. Your mom, she's the administrator of the money, so we'll call her the Government. We're here to take care of your needs, so we'll call
you the People. The nanny, we'll consider her the Working Class. And your baby brother, we'll call him the Future. Now, think about that and see if that
makes sense."" So the little boy goes off to bed thinking about what Dad has said. Later that night, he hears his baby brother crying, so he gets up to
check on him. He finds that the baby has severely soiled his diaper. The little boy goes to his parents' room and finds his mother sound asleep. Not wanting
to wake her, he goes to the nanny's room. Finding the door locked, he peeks in the keyhole and sees his father having sex with the nanny. He gives up and
goes back to bed. The next morning, the little boy says to his father, ""Dad, I think I understand the concept of politics now."" The father says, ""Good,
son, tell me in your own words what you think politics is all about."" The little boy replies, ""Well, while Capitalism is screwing the Working Class, the
Government is sound asleep, the People are being ignored and the Future is in Deep Shit.

""Don't listen to him, he's a smartass when he's drunk"".  All of this talking made a passenger in the back of the car wake up, and he blurted out: ""I knew

Happiness is a journey, not a destination.

Health is the greatest gift, contentment the greatest wealth, faithfulness the best relationship.

To be angry is to let others' mistakes punish yourself.

Holding on to anger is like grasping a hot coal with the intent of throwing it at someone else;you are the one who gets burned.

Thousands of candles can be lit from a single candle, and the life of the candle will not be
shortened.

You will always be getting praise and blame,but do not let either affect the poise of the
mind.

An outside enemy exists only if there is anger inside.

There is nothing so disobedient, as an undisciplined mind, and there is nothing so obedient, as a disciplined mind.

Happiness never decreases by being shared.     5PKR only  Whats the largest amount of money you've ever won?       means  Making A Living[Charlie Chaplin] Silent Comedy Short Movie 1914       on a sunny day in the spring of 1906 the Miles brothers filmed the journey down Market Streetfrom 8th street down to the Embarcadero from the front of a street car, where the streetcar ends it's journey, and is turned around for the return trip

Have no idea why but that movie did something to me and i cried for hours.     The last ping pong match with his dad killed me, especially because my dad died when i was 6 and wouldnt say goodbye to me cause he couldnt cope with it.     Am i the only one who instantly remembers Top Gear and Clarkson warning the other two about Honey Badgers?     I stopped playing back in 2012, and i was never tremendously talented. I know how to tune string by using the above ones, but i cant tune the E wire first because my sound perception and hearing is shit cause i didnt care about playing then and now i just want to learn a few simple songs with basic cords.     So Turkey has never bowed to anyone, never conquered by anyone? You just fucking said the allies were everywhere.Your strongest presence was the ottoman empire, from the 10 century and forwards, before that you could have been and were conquered by anyone who wanted to, its just they didnt want to. Ottoman empire was strong but doesnt change the fact that you terrorized the people in a ridiculous manner, raping stealing etc. Your main army was strong, but the other parts of it and your other population were peasants. You were the last nation to get rid of the Feudal system, back in the 19th century, which was the base of your country. And you know what the feudal system revolves around? Yeap, peasants and land. You can try and braveheart your country all you want, you were peasants, acted wildly, and when you finally changed that and became a civilized country more or less, you support Erdogan to bring you back to those times. You evolved like all the other people, dont go backwards.     Wow, after five years, mind you 5 years after the war ended you managed to get the allies to leave, by signing a treaty and shipping off your last sultan(rightly so). My country was under you savages for like 500 years more or less, we fought the entire time against an enemy larger than us by millions, and when we finally beat you no one said we kicked you back. And now you want Erdogan to bring back that way of living, based on terror and torture. Theres no room for wild peasants relying only on islam in the 21 century, so fuck off.      Reading your comment you seem to think that you are defying the whole world and that nobody can touch you. First of all the coup seems to be a ploy by Erdogan, second of all he is a dictator who tries to bring the country closer to the one which it was when it was founded which is wrong, since everything evolves, you cant have a stubborn, idiotic nation in the middle of the world, set back by its laws and leaders, cause they are smallminded people with narrow understandings. And last but not least, the allies defeated and occupied Turkey, so read your history books again     Thats a small group of people you are close to, its like saying Kobe was considered short just cause he played with Shaq. Dont get me wrong i get your point that you are short compared to them its just this theme here is based on a larger number of people     Montenegro     Nah, im from the balkans, no one considers 188 cm short bro...     Montenegrin     Montenegro ftw bro! 
     Im 181cm, which is like 5'11"" or something and have been called short...thats what happens when you live in a country where 6ft is an average height     As i wrote im only 18, but imma do something in computer sciences or political studies, maybe even bussines, still have a year to decide     Ill keep that in mind thank you!     Thank you, thats exactly the kind of answer i was looking for!     Im familliar with the Visa process and all of that, my main worry is how hard it is to adjust for immigrants jobwise, finding a job in your expertise, any discrimination against immigrants (thus the orange man reference), and is the life standard as good as they say. UK is so fucking expensive and i know that first hand, plus moving there from the sunny mediterranian isnt my priority. Canada and the Aussies are my backup options, but the US is my priority.     I get that, i liked the theme of loft though, it just suited me i think. I feel like i have to give the movie a shot to surprise me at the end, even though i wasnt interested the first part of it. For instance during my Guy Ritchie phase who is still my favourite director, i found the first 15,20 minutes of Snatch a bit dull but i endured and now i love the whole movie, although i still prefer Lock Stock which is in my top 5 of all time     If i had a good recommendation sure why not, but i tend to watch every movie i turn on in one sitting and try to finish it, so playing it safe is a good bet for me, and how i usually watch movies. Although whenever i find a foreign movie i have to be convinced to watch it but the likes of Loft (the belgian one) and Intouchables have opened my mind.Also im the kind of guy who when he finds an actor he likes or a director, watches his movies in a row until i drop dead so unless the story is very intriguing cast and possibly the director is my main guideline     The first one was amazing, the second one was dreadful and the third one was decent but wasnt enough to pull the trilogy out of the hole which the second dug up     According to IMDB even David Beckham is in it... But its Guy Ritchie, he could make Gary Busey fit the role of Romeo in a Romeo and Juliet action movie     Cast and a short description of the movie if im not already informed. I stopped watching trailers a while ago because they might make me biased towards a decision that isnt the correct one     Yeah i forgot the rice my bad.. It seems that balkan in general is linked with this dish and it originated in Serbia i think. However where im from, Montenegro we use the leaves of vinova loza, grapes used to make rakija similar to schnapps or however you spell it, its a strong alcholic drink     Blazers matched Crabbe just now     I didnt say otherwise, but he is originaly from my country, since he was born there. Thats exactly what determines where are you from, your citizenship, nationality and where you live is different     Ffs relax it was a hyperbole, but i feel so shit now, and especially bad since Raonic is from my country but is playing under the canadian flag so its like a triple blow to me right now     Well im officially never watching tennis again.     I figured id get a bit of a backlash from the brits but its understandable. I said could since i wasnt sure, and since when has dry humor became an excuse for having dumb moments? Its like the new sarcasm for idiots, and since i watched quite a bit of his interviews and his guest appearance on mock the week he seemed to laugh a lot and make facial expressions and comments which didnt point at dry humor such as Harrison Fords interviews.      While we are at running shots, i dont think there is a player in the world who can hit a better forehand without his feet set. And also i believe his running backhand is better than the standing one, since he always adjusts for more spin and ends up either hitting it with the frame or getting a much bigger arch, while running he hits it pretty much flat     Yeah in the fifth, althought there was a similar in the fourth so i dont know which one do you mean,but for this i didnt believe he would get it over the net, he barely put any power on the ball just some wrist action a hit an amazing passing shot     Or he could be a bit stupid sometimes... We all remember all the other players answering to the question "" With what do they eat their strawberries"" or something like that with the answer ""cream"" however Andy replied "" With my fingers""      What a point from Tsonga     Thats why i hate it so much, Nadal and his fucking play-to-backhand strategy have scarred me, after he won the tiebreaker i thought it was gonna be 2008 and the lost fifth after an amazing tiebreaker again.     I swear, the same, everytime he missed it i yelled ""Slice it ffs"" and when he pulled of that couple of amazing passing shots down the line, i was literally left speechless.     Am i the only one who gets anxious when Fed hits a backhand, i just dont trust that shot.     Its not always this tough rooting for Rog but today i almost died.     If youre a Fed fan, its better you didnt watch it. When it was 0-40 in the third i almost cried, and in the 4th set tiebreak i was on my knees on the floor the whole time.     I find it funny how whenever im watching Federer win i want to play tennis again but when he loses i never want to speak of tennis again let alone watch or play it.     I feel like even now Kyrgios isnt a kid like he used to be. Yeah sure, he sometimes gets angry, but now he does it like an adult, even politely, and by politely i mean passive agressively, asks the umpire and does swear and trow hissy fits. I could be wrong tho, i didnt really watch him much this wimbledon
     Today at work, after six exhausting hours of running around, and lifting stuff and shit, i literally leaped in the air and yelled ""He will win his eight"" when they told me Djokovic had lost, for the rest of the day i couldnt bring myself to stop smiling so if he wins it, ill probably weep aswell.   British office vs US office?  Want to start one of them, along with 30 rock. I absolutely love Ricky however I feel that the US version has the better cast      He barely breaks the top ten for me. Behind Curry, Harden, Wall, Westbrook, IT, CP3 even Kyrie and Kemba. Id even take Conley over him since he isnt a mist in the playoffs     Lmao Smart is one of the toughest guys in the league, just tries too hard to get an edge over the opposition. And Delly was/is one of the dirtiest players in the league     When it comes to trashing Juventus, it is entirely relevant     You are forgetting that Crotone and Bologna will wreck Juventus with a 5 goal difference each, and Juan Jesus will score the hattrick to lead us to the Seria A title     Jokic, although his development may have not been the same. However hindsight is 20/20  We will have atleast 5 guards next year, which one would you consider trading  Between IT, Bradley, Fultz, Rozier and Smart there are big decisions waiting to be made. I dont count Green here cause he plays mostly SF and will be probably gone. I would trade Smart, he is gonna get paid in 2018, cant shoot, questionable decision making and even though I love him to death can still kill me sometimes. Rozier would be a bench booster and I would give atleast 20 mins to Fultz  What popular and widely appreciated movie do you hate?  [removed]  Live perfomances of ""Love is a laserquest"" on a concert?  I keep finding videos infront of a studio audience but I want to see this kind of a performance     Thanks for clearing that up     Still not a pair     Every time Tony Brothers is motioning for a foul he looks like hes having a seizure      You shouldnt be, you would have had a better chance against Celta than United     Yeah my bad, I didnt read your question right, I thought that you could voluntarily quit and get like a pension or something     Oh crap, I didnt see it was a discharge, I thought it was you can voluntarily resign with benefits, my bad      I dont know anything about the actual number, just that I feel that even one suicide witnessed would leave a big trauma on the conducter or however the guy that is driving the train is called      certain number

I feel like that number should be one 
     Got the Celtics spread and got them over, on a double so thank you James Young  Played my second MTT, cashed out for the first time, here are my best hands  So I entered the freeroll 150 bankroll booster on bet365. The field had approx. 200 players and started as a shove fest but calmed down soon. I started like a nit with 5k and got down to about 4300 when I woke up with kings. I got it all in pre against A9s and doubled up because everything missed him. Few hands later I got AK suited and called a 3BB raise(240) from the MP. Flopped an ace and raised 560 on the flop, 480 cause the straight got there on the turn and 320 cause the board paired on the river. However he had AQ and i won 3k. 
Then came to the hand of the night
Woke up with jacks 2 spots behind the dealer, and called a 3bet from the UTG+1 and went three way to the flop
H:12220
UTG+1: 5780
BB: 9330
The flop comes 4s7h3s 
UTG+1 bets 665 
Hero calls
BB folds
turn 7s
Board paired and the flush got there and the villain bets 1596
His bet sizing and preflop raise made me put him on an AJ or KQ so I called
The river comes 6 of clubs and the one carded straight is there
He goes all in for around 3200 and I figured its either a pocket pair or a hand like i said above that has completely missed
I call he shows KJo and I get up to 18 k
From there I called a couple small all ins and got to around 23,4 k 
Fast forward to 35 players left and 27 paid and im hovering around 17 to 18 
We get to thirty players and I cant fold fast enough in the fear of bubbling and not getting my 1.5 (One for one drop aint got nothing on me) I fold hands like 77 and 10s
Finally I survive the bubble and get into a threeway all in with A10 of spades for 14 k
I hit the runner runner flush and triple up. Im down to 30 k when i get AJs and flop a jack and double up again, and the next hand i get 15 k more with queens. So now im folding and i get to the final hand of my tourney. I have like 2bb and go all in with 86, opponent has A10
I flop two pair he makes a runner runner straight and with a sick feeling in my gut I go out in 7th out of 198 and get 7.5 euros
     Its okay, im in a better place atleast mentally in that aspect, thanks though     That part of the lyric is really painful for me, so I chose to understand the first part as an existential crisis that im currently in lol     Do you look into a mirror to remind yourself you are there?     I fucking hate Amir Johnson, the 6foot9 man that looks like a homeles ww1 veteran trying to be a stretch five that has no shot and cant rebound for shit      That doesnt seem probable. It takes like 1.5 seconds to press the button, are you trying to tell me that the boat sank in two seconds, or maybe the skipper slipped or whatever     Yeah if only the game didnt last 4 quarters.      Its okay, Smart cant hit a free throw anyway...or a jumper...or a layup     Someone needs to tell the ref to take the whistle out of his mouth when he breathes out      Its the first half and we aint losing by 17 what timeline is this     Thats George Segal     I was at a swimming competition and we were watching the race for the special needs and handicapped kids. In my team there was a guy who lost the bottom half of his leg in an accident, so he was competing in the event. When they were waiting to start someone whistled and the guy on my team jumped in the water. I started laughing cause I thought he got startled and thought the race started, but I realized his only leg slipped and he fell into the pool when I opened my eyes to 200 people staring disapprovingly  What are the landing spots now for Cutler?  I thought the Texans might get him but now with Watson thats seems out of the question     Brady throws for 5k      Wouldnt a steal still be a TO     Can spell his name without Bradley     Dont know why you are downvoted, you are saying the truth     His injury was such a JR injury to me. I can see JR going ""yea boi this rim gonna get it now"" like TA did when his knee  spontaneously combusted     It isnt really, its more like saying ""Hey, can I get an advanced look into that stat you just offered""      Literally the last fucking line of my comment was that I am not taking anything away from him, are you that retarded?     I am curious to know the ammount of those that come from drive and kickout or just pass to LeBron and let the dad dicking begin. 
Not to take anything away from him just would be cool to know     I would count Green in the starting five since this is in reference to the playoff statistics, I dont know how he is as opposed to the league average     Clippers cant get a defensive stop to save their lives      FUCK YES THE ROOK     The fuck wrong wit you boy?     I like everything beside the placement of the bands name     His mechanics dont look broken and I like his energy but I dont see us keeping him if we get Fultz unfortunately     Terry is like a discount Westbrook, questionable shooting but will go 160 miles an hour down the court every fastbreak      I heard Jack Gylenhaal is better...     Even fucking Boriello keeps scoring against us... Although that may have to do something with our atrocious defence.     I live pretty much in the country next door and its a reminder what we could have done if not for the hatred, since back then we were one country.     Its Sarajevo I think.     Back when I was a kid, i just loved your team, I feel so bad seeing a team who was shoulder to shoulder with Real and Barca, struggle so much now. God I loved Albelda and Mendieta (only seen clips of him though). Even though i was a Barca fan i was still runing around and yelling Morientes whenever i scored in a pickup game, you guys were so nice to watch.     Guess who has two thumbs and has fell in a manhole? This guy.     I quit a long time ago, and now I play only like 7,8 2-set matches with my cousin during the summer. I live in a small town like 20k people so its hard to find a hitting partner but I can still hold my ground against a lot of active players. Recently I beat my mate who didnt quit and has been training here and in Italy for the past 12 years, the end score was 6-4, 2-6, 6-4 and if I were more in shape I'd have done better.     I started training like twelve years ago and these were one of the first exercises we were doing.     His slice was a thing of beauty, atleast to me. I felt everytime he sliced it, the ball would get sawed in half.     When in the post match interview Fed said that he endured a tough loss aswell here last year, and Andy replied with ""You only won 5 of them"" was probably my favourite interview moment ever. Right beside when Fed said that Murray would like to win the first Australian open for british tennis in ""what is it, a 150,000 years?""     After that I started rooting for Roddick so badly, cause he did everything right but a bad backhand volley and a couple of funny forehands cost him the win pretty much. Shame that he never made it back into another big final again.  I may just be a bitter Fed fan, but i dont think the '09 Wimby final gets nearly as much recognition as the '08 one, and i dont think it was much worse to be honest.       They are striking but also suede, so honestly id rather watch them than wear them cause suede is a bitch to clean.  My first pair of Air Forces ever, picked them up for 90 euros.       But Wolfsburg hosts Dortmund, not the other way round.     What a fucking assist by Messi, great vision.     Will it melt my heart?     Speaking as a Fed fan, its so nice to watch a 1HBH withouth the gutwrenching fear of it ending up in the net.      God I hate serbian commentators. The guy on eurosport keeps trying to find anything about other players and divert it towards Novak. He just said that Monfils and his lack of interest in playing a game where he was 0-40, and 1-5 in the set down, were supposed to annoy Novak ffs...     They agreed to a buyout, and they are paying him around two mil a yer till 2022 i think.     Nah, Larry had financial stability, his income was certain whether he played or not, but Kyrgios has to play to earn pretty much.     But he retired, which means the Bucks were left with his huge contract that they still have to pay off. In tennis if you retire, noone gives a fuck.     For instance, im a two hander since i can remember, but lately, when i decide to go to the courts since i stopped playing competitevely, whenever i get a short ball i decide to let the one hander fly. Sure it feels amazing, but any deeper balls, or a bit higher i immediately decide to change my grip and go with two hands. I think a lot of people prefer the 2H cause its more comfortable and a firmer and better feel for it.     I think there is a certain difference between a DW and a Rolex, so i wouldnt make that sort of a comparison lightly.     Who turned water into wine, but when i put wine in a water bottle when i go for a run, suddenly i have a ""problem"".     Hating the Lakers is like a religion, the reason i get up on a tough wednesday.     Thats basically what i was asking. I worked physical work this summer, earned a bit, and money is no pressure for me but i just thought id check to be certain. 

Nah, gym requires work and i think my ""2 photocopiers 1 guy and a palmtree"" live show is doing quite well.      Just imagine Shakespear if he was retarded and a goldfish. So basically unconnected sentences, with grammatic errors combined with a plot that lasts as long as my memory which is 26 seconds when I write.     L for Liverpool? 
     I trained swimming for like 3,4 years, although i stopped caring after a year and a half. Since i go back to training every few months i get tired very quickly. The trick i found, is limit the use of the legs in the first part since they tire you the quickest, if you want to rest a bit and go slower, and at like 250 start using them properly.      He is annoying when playing ofcourse, he would return a balistic missile, but later in his interviews he shows his kind side. I remember when he beat Fed in the 2014 finals, which I barely survived, i still hate that match, he said to Roger later on ""Thanks for letting me win"" which brought a smile to my infuriated face.     Referring to cevapi as a traditional Croatian dish is blasphemy to the holy grail of them, the cevapi from Sarajevo, and im not even Bosnian so im not biased.     I feel like Delpos forehand should be somehow forbidden, it looks like it could kill a medium sized dog.      I was just thinking about that. He wasnt during his younger years, his emotions got the best of him then just as Feds got him for example when he was hot headed, but Djokovic matured incredibly as a player and as a sportsman. Just like Roddick told Fed once ""Id love to hate you but you're really nice"", for me the same applies to Nole.      Being a Partizan and a Boston fan, 2010 was a shitshow for me aswell. And being a Federer fan didnt help since he started getting old and hurting himself and Novak became a fucking Apache helicopter, almost unstoppable.      They usually are but this was taken after about an hour of drinking and dancing so when they fall down i just tuck them up however and this is the result      Really? Here they are like the go to shorts when you go out in the summer, like 95 percent of people here have them.      Flyknit in white is a bitch to keep clean, atleast mine were, anything and everything would get on there an fucking stay. However even though they seem nice in black as a casual shoe, i think there are far more prettier designs by Nike, flyknit for me isnt that great unless its in combined colors like the red AF1 Nike introduced a while back.     I thought so, but i wondered since it doesnt show the main part, the thing thats hangs from it, the crystal or whatever...
Nah not diamonds these are my gifts

and the other one 
http://imgur.com/zIjt075     So like a regular Melissa McCarthy?      The Perks of Being a Wallflower.
Absolutely in love with this movie yet when recommend it to people they are either sceptical or surprised.      I even fucking guessed that we were gonna concede in the 58th...     Relax we are gonna concede two in 5 minutes then Totti will score in the 95th from a penalty.

EDIT: WAIT, NO, FUCK I WAS JOKING     Well that flew over my fucking head so badly. Since I have Roma to win and both teams to score on my acca I think the defence is amazing aswell :)      I wonder how the fuck did you understand my comment as a dig, so you decided to counter it, but today they are rock solid, so i'd stop mocking them atleast until the 58th minute when inevitably Juan Jesus will score an own goal trying to tie his laces.      Well you kinda jinxed it...     Nah I really phrased it wrong. What gives me hope is just look at the array of center that came from the Balkans, Divac, Pekovic, Vucevic, we can only hope he is as good as them.      Yeah I get you, I just posted this as an info, not as a counter argument, sorry if it came across that way.     Btw, Zizic had 37 points and 20 rebounds IIRC, in the last game in the Adriatic League.      Didnt he come back from a break down in the first, and won a set? I think it kinda worked.     Ziva istina, tesko je prevest sa divnog jezika na ove jednostavne...     Not to brag but he is a part of a very brave nation. I could tell you all about the history of Montenegro, but I think that the battle of Mojkovac will tell you all. On the dawn of our christmass, 6,000 Montenegrin fought 20,000 Austrians and Hungarians, just so the Serbian army could safely retreat. Even though the opponents were better armed and had much more people, we won. 
There is a saying in our country that goes ""Nikad Crnogorac kukavica nije, smrt ga gleda on se na nju smije"", which basically means: ""A Montenegrin is never a coward, while death is staring at him he smiles back"". Come to think of it the lack of rhyme really diminishes its sounding, bloody english language.      This right here is what I wanted to say, but Im not sure if I delivered the way I thought to. But anyway, to understand the history of our country you have to learn about so many factors that it is just tiring, goddamn you, our vast, incredible history and stunningly beautiful culture overrun by hatred and idiotism!      This was WWII, and even though the Partisans which he was a part of fought against the opressors Italy, Germany and Austria, they also fought against Chetniks since their idea of power was to cruel, and too narrow minded. They hated the communists, and thought no matter how much good they do they were still useless. They had a wrong ideology, wanted to take over every single nation here, pretty much the only good thing they did was the fight against the Nazis, and even that was half-done. 
Ustase are definitely worse than them, but they were bad people, filled with hatred to anyone different.   The last photo of edomir ""Ljubo"" upi, a Montenegrian law student, activist and member of the Communist resistance movement. Here he is smiling, while facing a firing squad, with shackles on his wrists. He was executed moments later by Chetniks for fighting against fascism and nazism. [250x338]       Just have to remind everyone that the great Toto Di Natale took care of his disabled sister after his death.      Nah dont do this to me, when he broke Tomasevics spine twice, a part of me died. He commited crimes against our nation and I wont have a reminder of it on my sanctuary that is reddit.      Milo mi je sto se konacno Joveti isplacuje to sto se bori kao lav za reprezentaciju, jer nekad zna da precera jer oce previse da uradi.      He is from Pe, which is in Kosovo very close to the border with us but has been a part of Montenegro for a big part of history, so he considers himself a Montenegrian.      Yeah, but what made him so mad?     I dont know if I am an idiot, or should have watched the original but what the fuck was Mad Max?     I sent mine away for the weekend and its heaven here. However he left me a couple of ""presents"" that I didnt notice when I came home first, so I spent half the day cleaning the house.     Ma e druze, koji grad?     Dude where are you from? Since you know pretty much about our basketball if Buducnost was a cant miss opportunity.     Well I hope my three month old beagle pup grows out of the ""doing my best satan impersonation"" phase  and grows up into a loving dog.     God I love Donnie Brasco, one of my favourite movies of all time.     I am a Celtics fan who adores Rondo, so I might be a little biased, but if I were a Bulls fan I would be thrilled to see the ball being brought up in one of the best and safest hands in the league, besides maybe Wall and Irving cause of his skills. Its a joy to see that he isnt hogging and his vision is still there to provide those fast passes, just needs a bit more syncing with the team, other than that I think he will be very good this year.     Fun fact: Its called 90 mile beach since back in the day people who traveled across it on horses figured out that the time they used up on crossing it would equal to 90 miles, however they failed to account for the sand which significantly slowed the horses down.      Its just the number 1 and 2. If i could make him do it outside or atleast show me he wants outside i would be eternally grateful but noo, this little fucker hates my guts apparently.     I live in apartment thats the issue number one, so its like a 30 second walk to anywhere outside. Second he keeps sniffining litteraly everything, an eating whatever he can fit. He keeps biting me and other stuff, and imma fucking die.     The sit command he learned in like 5 minutes as soon as I gave him food... We avoid putting carpets, but it still isnt stopping him. This morning I was awaken by a tongue in my face from the guiltiest dog ever who shat in my closet and peed all over my room.      I love this furball but i have like two issues with him. The pooping and peeing inside the house and the fact that i cant get him of my leather sofa. Other than that ill manage just fine, even if i have to fight him every single day.      Looks like im gonna be shooting myself in about a month, thanks anyway!      I can confirm this is true since I didnt understand anything.     Sorry man, I guess I forgot to add that its pretty much accurate when it comes to my opinion aswell, those are just the two changes i'd add, my bad.      OHB is definitely Gasquet, and with slice i would go with Dimitrov other than that its pretty much accurate.     Inter and like half of the French league, especially those twats from Marseille     Yeah, I love clay cause no one can cheat you out of a point, since there is marks everywhere.     Nike vapor zoom aj3 i think     Since I only have clay courts around my place, if I ever consider playing on them in these shoes my family has strict orders to shoot me in the face.     Yeah i was so excited for them, and then couldnt find them under 400, even that didnt seem to much since i adore the GOAT, but my bank account didnt agree.
I laughed at the guys dying for limited yeezys, like how can you be stringed up so much on fucking sneakers even if they are limited and now a part of my soul is missing cause of these.  This is my holy grail, a wish on my bucket list that I'll never cross out.        Yeah but 10 miles an hour doesnt really seem that much, especially when its already 60 that hes doing.      Im pretty sure you are supposed to cover the closer post with the wall, otherwise the ball will have more time to fall. Horrendous positioning from the keeper aswell.      How the fuck is he the asshole for driving the speed he feels comfortable with? Hes not drastically slower than the limit, and he is obeying the laws. If you want to get into a pissing contest and be so manly that you drive a bit faster than him thats fine, but the person isnt an asshole, you are just frustrated.     Mine is the sneakiest son of a bitch know to mankind.      Todays menu, and I cant stress ""todays"" enough, was his meal, then a plant he found on the balcony, bread he found somewhere, a plastic bag, toilet paper, spaghetti he stole from me, a slipper, a sock, my bag, followed by two of his regular meals, and still he waited around for food. When he realized he wasnt gonna get any, he had a fight with my stuffed bear and fell asleep on my head for the millionth time today. God I hate that i love him.      I have a beagle and its geniunely the same situation, except this guy weighs about 25 kilos less so its a bit easier for me. However he decides he needs to make up that difference with speed so I pretty much get knocked out by a dog flying the speed of sound twice a week.     I think the key word here is naked, and in -30 degrees celsius things would start to fall of. And I doubt casual attire will keep you warm enough longer than a night to survive.      We thought Berdych didnt qualify, we were wrong.      I watched the horrific italian accent scene atleast 15 times, and everytime I speak italian i always say ""Buongiorno"" in the most hideous way I can and chuckle a bit.     But a lot of them saw Troy. After a",0

Trump doesn't know what he's doing but the CIA knows exactly what the goal is.     Queue Professor Click: ""We need some muscle over here! No seriously this time!""     One of my biggest fears with the JWST is the reaction wheels failing. Apparently the reaction wheels were made by the same people who made the failed reaction wheels on Kepler. I don't have a source for that, it's just something I picked up somewhere and don't really know how to verify. 

Regardless, the more moving parts, the more possibility of a part failure. JWST has a lot of moving parts, particularly with its initial deployment/unfurling phase.     Saves 30 minutes compared to plane travel, saves 3+ hours by car. And Miami is not a fun place to drive.     There is so much to do that doesn't involve free roam PVP that I gave up trying to write a list out. GTA Online has much more content than it did upon initial release.      My uncle committed suicide believing he wasn't needed. A few months later, his widowed wife had an asthma attack in the middle of the night and couldn't find her inhaler. The kids found her the next morning. If he was there he would've been able to help her.     It's not about finding someone you agree with 100% of the time. It's about finding somebody, anybody, who isn't doing the bidding of their big donors. 

Our politicians are puppets being controlled by oligarchs. Our politicians do not fight for their constituents, they fight for the people who give them the means to continue lying to their constituents. 

Corey Booker received more money from Wall Street than any other politician, Democrat or Republican. Corey Booker defended Mitt Romney, against Barack Obama, when Obama criticized Romney for his connections to Bain Capital. You really think that guy is going to fight for you? Maybe if you pay him.     I believe in the Wikipedia it says that people who were sentenced to death by beast would have to fight beast after beast. If they killed the first lion, a second lion would be released. And a third if needed, etc.

But there are three types of Bestarii, as far as I can tell. There are the animal trainers who were considered Bestarii, there were Bestarii who were sentenced to death by beast, and then there were Bestarii who were affluent people that were given favorable conditions to fight in. That's what I gathered from Wikipedia though, I might be wrong and if I am I'd love to know what's true!  How legit were the Roman Bestiarii? Did Carpophorus really fight a lion, tiger and bear fairly? Did Lysimachus kill a lion with his bare hands?  I am interested in some of the gentlemen who fought as Bestarii in the Roman Colosseum, and other arenas by extension. Those being, people who trained, fought along side, or against animals in the arena. 

With the limited resources at my disposal, I am having trouble finding concrete claims about what transpired there. From what I gather, most of the time that animals were involved in the arena, there was a large handicap utilized either in favor of the fighter, or the animal. For example, I have read about how Commodus would fight wild lions. And I have read less about how he did it while standing on a platform above them and shooting at them with arrows. Not exactly heroic, but quite exactly Commodus. Likewise, I am wondering about how exaggerated these other claims were:

*""As a punishment, damnatio ad bestias is mentioned by historians of Alexander's campaigns. For example, in Central Asia, a Macedonian named Lysimachus, who spoke before Alexander for a person condemned to death, was himself thrown to a lion, but overcame the beast with his bare hands and became one of Alexander's favorites.""* - Is this story legit? Did Lysimachus get sentenced to death by lion, only to defeat it and become a king? His Wikipedia doesn't mention, and you think it would.

Similarly, I have found this excerpt *""Martial (Spectacles, XVII, XXVI) noted that Carpophorus, who was renown as a bestiarius, as having killed a bear, a lion, and a leopard. In fact, Carpophorus is said to have killed twenty wild animals in one show.""* 

I truly wonder if any of these accounts are correct, or if they are embellishments. 

Do we know for a fact if there is any evidence that there was ever a ""fair fight"" held between humans and animals, or were they always favored one way or the other, by either heavily arming the men, injuring the men before combat, or injuring the animals before combat?

Was there ever a notable contestant in the arena who did manage to survive the ferocious onslaught of a hungry lion, leopard or bear on equal footing? It seems to me that most of the time the winner was determined before they stepped on to the arena. 

Also, were there women bestarii who fought with or trained animals for the arena?     I don't think anybody is beyond political bias, regardless of race or education.      ""He writes from a libertarian conservative perspective"", which is fine, as long as we all can acknowledge that.     WND and National Review? You do realize these two sources have no more legitimacy than their leftist counterparts like HuffPo and ThinkProgress, right? Smh.     Another of the reasons was that she lost $30,000 that was supposed to help save her family's business. In the grand scheme of things that sort of loss is obviously not worth taking your life over but in the perspective of a teenager who only knows a life in which her family depends on keeping the business open, it's a significant setback that could be reversed with life insurance and/or suing the school (neither of which I think would be fair to exploit though)     What do you mean ""you people""? Is that people who don't defend political propaganda? How is asking for common sense divide   conquer?     The universal translator did kick in when communicating with the alien species. It translated the language literally, for example ""his arms wide"" is an English translation of their language. But simply knowing the dialect couldn't help to explain the methodology they used in communication.      There is a sizable crossover between KiA subscribers and Breitbart subscribers. Doesn't make any sense, really. Just prepare to be downvoted by them, because they'll never admit that Breitbart is propaganda.      I think there is a way to make it work where you could set Crayak up as the one who sent the Capasins. He played with civilizations all the time, maybe he is the one who influenced the initial attack on Ellimists home world.

That being said, I think the main antagonist of The Ellimist isn't one person, but the perpetual ""a new player has joined the game"" where after he beats one challenger, a new appears.      Animorphs has a serialized storyline and a slow progression that would make it hard to do a good stand-alone movie. I imagine you would need a trilogy or some such. If you could convince one of these old curmudgeon movie execs to pay the bills then go for it! But I think that another option could be to put out a stand-alone Ellimist movie that could garner the hype for an eventual Animorphs trilogy. The nostalgia factor could be replaced with curiosity, considering most Animorphs casuals have not read any of the Chronicles series and might want to see what it's about. And if you set up an interesting universe that makes people want to see more, which is what you need to tell the full story.     You know the image of the Ellimist on the book cover? I think he looks good like that, and seems humanoid enough. You're right though, the CGI effects would cost a fortune! Perhaps the movie could be computer animated?  The Ellimist would make a great movie, I think.  Reading through this subreddit's archive, it seems as though a potential movie deal for The Animorphs was considered and then shortly thereafter shot down due to perceived disinterest in the series.

I think a remedy for a lack of interest could come from an initial standalone Ellimist movie. The Ellimist, while connected tangentially to The Animorphs, does not necessarily need the context of The Animorphs in order to be a good story.


Roughly speaking, The Ellimist is a gamer who is terrible at games. The whole story revolves around him being challenged by gamers progressively better than himself and getting schooled a bunch of times before finding cunning ways to overcome his enemies. Every time he wins, he just moves on to the next level and encounters a new boss, so to speak. Through his progression from challenger to challenger, he becomes more resolved, wiser, and eventually omnipotent. This is a guy who started out just playing video games for fun in his spare time, and ended up becoming one of the most powerful beings in the universe (that we know of). I think this concept would have mass-appeal to a movie audience, and especially to gamers.

Obviously a few things would have to change. The ending would have to be more conclusive, while not absent of sly references to the Animorphs, it would have to have its own stand-alone conclusion.

If this is successful as it's own movie, we could perhaps see more of The Chronicles series brought to the screen. Again, there would need to be some changes, maybe to the continuity, but they could all work as their own stand-alone movies without any overt reference to the The Animorphs. Then once all of those are done, give it a few years and release The Animorphs on TV/Movie, if there is a demand for it.

The Ellimist is an appealing story for sci-fi fans even if they know nothing about The Animorphs. In the series you explore several different non-humanoid alien species, and planets, that would satiate any sci-fi fan's appetite and potentially the movie could lead the way for others, if there is a demand.

It's rather rare in my perspective for a character who starts out as a less-than-average bloke to make his way through the game of life and come out a Demi-God. Even in some of the better series of our days, like Game of Thrones, everybody has a secret bloodline or prophecy or special skill. Even The Animorphs went this route when we found out that they were probably hand-selected for the job. 

I just think this movie would be received well by the general audience. I'm not saying it would explode at the box office, but might be more of a sleeper hit that tantalizes people in to wondering what else the Ellimist universe has to offer. Even if it is the only movie of the entire series to get made, I would be happy that the story gets told. I think Ellimist's character progression is just super cool, and the world created around him is one that we don't really see much in movie or television. 

What do you think, would you like this idea or is what I just wrote an affront to all you love and hold dear? I catch myself thinking about an Ellimist movie once every few months and I don't exclude the possibility of it happening, we might just have to wait another 20 years.     It's not supposed to be an alternative for driving within a city, it's supposed to be a quicker alternative for people to travel from Orlando to Miami, and back. The geography and highway design of Florida makes it a three or four hour drive on a hellish highway to get from one city to the other. As an Orlando native, I have only been to Miami twice because the drive is just that terrible. I could easily see myself going with my girlfriend to Miami for a day or a weekend if it only meant a 30 minute trip. I have reservations about the application of this technology but if it works I would gladly use it.      He campaigned on non-interventionist policy, of course his voters would feel duped.      Might just be disconnection. Happens.      You can leave the game and come back at a later time and still be on the same roll. If you hit the white die, wait for the jackpot to accumulate before continuing to roll.     ""Hodor""     I love this idea! Do you think the series would work better as animated (classically or computer?) or live action? I have a hard time picturing live-action Hork-Bajiir speak through their beaks.     I can definitely see how it would be difficult, but movies without clear antagonists have been done before.

https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/296epq/movies_with_no_villain/

Interestingly, the first example is Cast Away, which I had imagined being similar to Ellimist in a way. The long periods of isolation away from civilization and the feeling of being stranded. I think that if they did try to make an Ellimist movie they should take notes from Cast Away on how to tell an engaging story, and convey emotion, with basically one main character.

As for a mini-series, it goes without saying that I would be absolutely for it. I think The Animorphs, if ever brought back to the screen, would need a more serialized format than a movie trilogy. A mini-series would work for that, an actual TV series would work too. But I see the transition between a hypothetical precursor Chronicles mini-series to an Animorphs TV show to be a smoother move than having Chronicles as movies and then pushing an Animorphs TV show.

Maybe this is where the fanboy of me takes over my logic and reason, where I'm just like ""Let's get it started and figure out the details later"" lol     So if you take the Ellimist from the cover, make him younger initially, and add wings/talons I think he would look decent. Humanoid in the face, while not taking away what made that type of extraterrestrial function.

Edit- Didn't downvote you by the way, not sure who would. Maybe Crayak.      What if you counteract the stretching with a molecular squeezing device?      Flight attendants being unsympathetic hardliners with condescending, self-righteous attitudes? Well I never! Most flight attendants are like that woman in the video, all they want to do is get to their location on time while making sure their passengers are being publicly shamed in the process.     Older ladies need to speak up because anybody else would've probably been dragged off the plane for questioning authority.     It's really been something to see Chris Ray Gun's video making talent improve over time.      Radical Muslims killing innocents on a daily basis should make you sadder.     Nobody in here is calling Muslims ""subhumans"". Maybe reevaluate your defensiveness on the subject.      You're right I would've been fine with superdelegates flipping in favor of Bernie because he would've fought to get rid of Superdelegates, fixing the problem. Instead we get status-quo suits voting for the status-quo against the wishes of their constituents with no intent to change or improve the delegate system that they benefit from directly.

Also Howard Dean being a doctor is a weak argument of authority considering it's not really relevant to being a politician. By your logic, Ben Carson should pick the next President.

This whole notion that out-of-touch party elites who can't sympathize with the average American would know what's better for us than we do is just demoralizing. This election was decided by populists and Dean chose to deny his party's populist the vote. Maybe if Dean knew what was actually better for us, he would've nominated the candidate that stood a better chance of winning, instead of nominating the candidate that gives him money.     Sorry, but I don't think Howard Dean knows better than his constituents. Maybe you're fine with superdelegates being authoritarians who dictate decisions that the majority votes against, but it still bothers me.     Well I would have showed up, but the primary rules in my state forbade me from voting because I'm registered Independent. Someone like Bernie could've gotten me to join the party again.     In some cases there were districts that voted in favor of Sanders during the primary, but the Representatives were Superdelegates and cast their votes for Clinton. Howard Dean did this and when they asked him why he voted against his constituents, his answer was basically ""I think I know better than my constituents""     It was on the local news here as well. The reason being that local news simply gets their national news from other sources. They read the AP report and just copied it verbatim. 

It's examples like these that should make you question media sources. Often the information you get is simply a piece of the story, having been passed through multiple channels with no independent verification along the way.     There was some testing done by a Youtuber that found GTA V cops were not racist and actually used lethal force on Trevor more than anybody else.      ""The Middle"" is also pretty decent show that is endearing in its attempts to appeal to the middle class.     Isn't steam water naturally distilled?     They said there was no tie to ISIS, but that they consider it a hate crime.     You're saying that if she ran as an independent without backing from the DNC that she still stood a possibility of winning? I guess it's possible, although it would be shocking and unprecedented. I would question how such an endeavor would even work, considering how intertwined her campaign was with those who work for and donate to the DNC.     The fact that people like you still don't understand why Hillary Clinton was a bad candidate is exactly why people still have to talk about her failed candidacy.     She would not have won a majority of votes if she was not propped-up by the DNC. She was a flawed candidate that the DNC should not have run with.       They absolutely pitted armed men against defenseless creatures. There was one story about how they took an entire community of elephants and put them in an arena against heavily armed men with spears, and the slaughter was so brutal that the elephants' cries actually made the audience boo the Emperor.     What? No.     You think that's bad, consider yourself lucky they didn't have cameras recording the Roman Gladiator games.     At the end of the podcast he explained that his next podcast would ""be a doozy"", and that he had recorded both podcasts back-to-back. The next podcast was the one with Eddie ""Just look in to it"" Bravo. Maybe Joe was just fatigued mentally after recording with Eddie.

I didn't like his line of questioning ""Don't you feel responsible?"" either.     Up until a few weeks ago, I wrongly believed that John and Hank Green were the big brothers of Laci Green. They legit seem like they could've been siblings.     There is a lot more than just coincidental evidence linking the professor to the attack, but we can't post it on Reddit because they consider it Doxxing.

Socialist propaganda.     One of the hardest roles, but also one of the only roles where you could AFK, walk away and eat a sandwich, fall asleep at the computer, and still win.     That's quite an ambitious undertaking! Good luck!      Okay, just keep downvoting me with no explanation.      Seriously, what's with this presumptive comment? That's not what I meant at all.      I'd like to see the methodology used behind the ""People check their phones 2600 times a day on average"" because that's A LOT! Like, probably not a correct statistic because it's so much. Just do the math, an 18 hour waking cycle would mean people check their phones 144 times an hour, or twice per-minute. I'd wager my daily average is on the higher end, and I don't come anywhere close to 144 times an hour.     There was definitely something generational for a decade or two where, culturally, gamers were considered losers, freaks   geeks, including the girl gamers at the time. 

When I was a teenager, it was considered laughable by my female peers to be playing video games. I succinctly remember several occasions of being insulted or derided (the way kids do) for playing video games, almost exclusively by girls. I also remember a few occasions where I tried to get a girl to play a video game only to be met with an expression of revulsion. To this day, my girlfriend maintains a similar attitude where if I'm playing a game and I want to show her something cool she will roll her eyes and act like whatever I just showed her was sooo lame. I love her regardless somehow. 

The generation of kids younger than me did not seem to have this same issue. I found that girls born in the 90's are not repulsed by video games as much, and younger girls don't have any aversion to video games at all. This is all anecdotal of course, as I'm not a kid and cannot actually embed myself in that culture.

Modern society's viewpoints on gaming/technology and geeks/nerds has shifted quite a bit, to the point where being a geek became so cool that people wear fake ""nerd glasses"" as a fashion statement. This newfound acceptance has been accompanied by mobile gaming, which appeals to a much wider demographic of people who wouldn't have touched a video game controller about 10 years ago.     Interesting, any sources on this? From anecdotal experience, some of the most irreligious people I know were ones who went to church like 4 times a week as children and learned it was oppressive nonsense. Many of the religious people I come across rarely go to church and just believe because it's, like, nice to think about or whatever.     ""Sub-optimal"" presumes an optimum, and in a post-modernist society there is no such thing as true optimization. How could you be so hateful?     Yes, this! Take your time with the series because once you've seen it all, you've seen it all.

If you're wondering about the process I first cut out the the characters in Photoshop, animated them in After Effects, rendered a movie, imported that into Photoshop again and made a GIF. They're pretty heavy for GIFs, usually around 500-700kb, but I'd rather have them big, long(time) and with as many colors as possible.

 In this modern world we have everything in front of us to get inspired from and its so easy . but the most important thing is the inner urge what we need most. and we can achieve that urge by doing something very simple. those are-

2. Chewing Gums- really ? are you laughing ? But yes its true, chewing gums actually helps to improve the our brains function. and it will improve our mental health to think positive and creative.

3. Singing in the shower- if you have habit to listen song or singing in the shower then yes, you're in the right track, you will feel motivated that time and your inner you will scream and tell yes I can, you can think about the ideas that are going in your mind, and you can find out the solution. 
these all are psychological matters of our everyday life and if we can make these possible, we can solve anything, so just walk, sing and chew gums.

I've taken a few workshops with him too. Definitely a big inspiration.     I took my first class with Andrew when I was 14. Taken a few workshops and met him many times since. Would definitely say he's been an influence.     Careful with the Reagan-era anti-drug propaganda. ;)      Got the message and hung up the phone.      I do!

XD  Struggling to Install my Vive can you help?  I just got my vive with the HP Envy bundle last week. I've been working at it the past few days to install it and I'm really struggling. The computer isnt recognizing the Vive's headset. My computer has a Raedon RX 480 Graphics Card that has 1 HDMI and 4 Display Ports. By the recommendation of some google searches I bought a mini-display port to display port cable and I'm attempting to run that as the output for the headset. It doesn't seem to be working. I could also buy an  HDMI splitter if that would work. I know the computer is recognizing the usb part of the headset just not the visual output on the card. I am sure I have the latest graphics card drivers. I also tried starting the computer without anything plugged into the HDMI just the Display Port. Also it seems like one of the controllers isn't working, that maybe it isn't holding a charge properly and the computer says its firmware isn't up to date. Did I just get a bad system? The computer otherwise is working 100 percent fine. Can you help me?

Thanks guys!!!     I am a psychedelic artist who created a psychedelic work of art in tilt brush and thought that the people here would appreciate it.   Psychedelic Art in Virtual Reality - First time gettin' Tilt    First time gettin' Tilt       Yeah it's 1-1, the exact size of the plates. Though the plates are made bigger than the ones in the book. About 11x17 inches.     I'm pretty sure he used to teach there also.      Happy to answer. You work from a more generalized version of the image, to a more specific and detailed version. And you work in a manner which is very methodical and sequential. The method is set up so that you are accurate at every stage, always checking as you go, and you make corrections as needed as things change subtly. You can use a ruler a bit towards the end for final minor corrections, when things may be off one or two millimeters. Most of the measurement is done by eye, but also using a piece of string or a knitting needle on occasion. Any other questions I am happy to answer.      The darkest values are patiently handled with a 2B pencil.     Corel painter      It's relevant because it was painted under the influence of psychedelics.

I love your work!      I'm just doing what I love to do, man. :)      http://subject3787.bigcartel.com/     http://subject3787.bigcartel.com/     http://subject3787.bigcartel.com/     Ernst Fuchs is a big one. :)      For fun and freedom of expression. :)      I do think that psychedelics can have enormous benefits if used wisely.      Drugs aren't really part of my process at all to be honest. I'd be lying if I said that I haven't taken some and that they were some of the most powerful and influential experiences of my life, and I've certainly been inspired by those experiences but I'm usually cold sober when it comes to making art.      Thanks man! I just started, and then picked up various resources along the way. I learned a lot from books and the internet and eventually sought out specific artists I wanted to learn from and studied their techniques. Mostly it's just a lot of practice. And I'm still just learning. Depending on where you live there are great painting workshops in many parts of the world and I'd be happy to recommend some.      All of it is done totally sober (well might sip some wine or smoke some weed sometimes.)      I suggest vipassana meditation retreats and long hours behind an easel.      Wow! I'd love to see them.      Sometimes days, sometimes months...     I'm working on it.     In analog media I use mostly oil and egg tempera and acrylic as well as pencil and pen, but sometimes inks and airbrush and other techniques. For digital I use corel painter and adobe photoshop and have a wacom cintiq companion PC. A lot of these images are brought out of abstractions like Rorschach images with stains or digital chaos.      Huge compliment! Thank you!     Yes, he's a friend and I've taken his workshops with his wife Allyson who have been great supporters of mine. :) And he is a hero.      The third eye to me represents a non-visual form of vision. Looking inward, essentially.      I would love to if I could afford it.      Thank you!      Thanks for fixing the link. :)      Yes, but so do we all according to some research.      I know him personally.      Lay it to the internet to insult my appearance when the topic is my art. And believe it or not I live a mostly sober life.      Yes, I've taken some classes from Android and use some of his methods with Painter.      No photographs at all and I rarely use reference. Most of this is straight out of my imagination.       Sometimes months.   Here's some of my artwork. I LIVE to make art. Let me know what you think.       I took his art camp one summer.      Yes.     The way we've done it is that we've built up to a climax and then right about the peek after having already been having sex, we've both taken a big hit of dmt. The experience is extraordinary. It amplifies the sensation dramatically. I have lost my erection almost every time but it is still a powerful physical sensation. The experience has been totally physical, instead of visual. She has said that these experiences have been the most powerful sexual experiences of her life. We have also done this with oral sex alone, with me on her, and her on me. I'll wait to describe our individual experiences in greater depth and see if she'll want to contribute as well.      It's something I discovered through my interest in Robert Venosa's work and he learned it from the great Max Ernst. You can do it by rubbing sheets of plastic or saran wrap on thin wet paint.      http://subject3787.bigcartel.com/     24x36 inches. The heart is done with mischetechnique, hatching white over glazes of oil color.      I'll check it out, thanks.     Tool is one of my favorite bands ever, what can I say? ;)     I love psytrance and I'm not ashamed to say it!     Not Miley Cirus btw but my friend Shelby who is a painter and fashion designer and modeled live for that portrait.     I love Tool. :)     Sorry, I think it's pretty common to have an artists picture at the top of an article about them.     A lot of it is through a process called pareidolia where I create random stains or patterns (through a process called decalcomania) and then look at it and paint in what I see. It's a bit like a Rorshach test. Anyone can do it and its a great way to free up creativity.      Not in Vienna but I've taken workshops with Andrew 4 or 5 times.     It's cool, I appreciate it. Ultimately I'm doing the best I can and trusting in my own taste even if it doesn't appeal to everyone.      Ozora because it was small and chill. My girlfriend got really sick at Boom so we couldn't have much fun together. It was also really hot and getting there literally right after Ozora was a bit of a drag.     I hung out with my girlfriend naked in Sasha's Shulgins' lab once. There is pictorial evidence.      I've taken pretty much everything in both the tryptamine and phenylethamine form. I've drinken ayahuasca and smoked dmt many times and they've been important experiences for me. Ultimately though my real spiritual practice is just living life. The dmt state shows me about the workings of perception, that beneath it all there is the timeless witness, consciousness. And that's all I can say for certain, that there is experience, that something is going on right now. I'm not really on so much anymore about getting to some really high state or getting some kind of clear message, I'm more about resting in the uncertainty of it all, taking what life gives me, and rolling with it.

What did you think of the non digital work?     I went last year! It was great. If you look up the RadiOzora soundcloud there is an interview that I did with them on there.     Currently in San Francisco, CA - born here too - but a bit nomatic. So many influences but I love Ernst Fuchs, Odd Nerdrum, Beksinski, Alex Grey, and Robert Venosa.     I have some friends that teach great painting workshops in Colorado. Look them up: David Heskin, Philip Rubinov Jacobson, and Amanda Sage.      Bi-girls are crazy about me. ;)       I've made many.

It's how reality is formed from our perceptions. The eyes are you looking out at yourself.

OMFG 360 degree view of the Ernst Fuchs Apocalypse Chapel in Klagenfurt, Austria!!!       This poem was written on the painting before the background was put in:

This painting is a prayer.
I will forget, let me remember.
Help me see the ever present stillness
when I am blinded by chaos.
I will be mindful.
Let me be humble.
Let me be kind.
Let me come into spirit.
Let me feel deeply.
Give me strength
to survive the illusion.
Let me penetrate the material.
Let me know the riches
of my own heart.      It's a silk screen design on thin cotton rather than a high res sublimated print on polyester. Basically they cost way less to make.     http://subject3787.bigcartel.com/     It represents me coming out of a spiritual and creative block into a new chapter of abundance. Earlier in the painting I had written this poem:

subject3788,"    I am pretty sure you can return your loan funds within a specified time and avoid any interest and fees. Obviously this is not concrete info, I apologize for that. You are the captain of your own life-don't be afraid to choose a different course then what is laid before you.      I am getting my Brokers License and will begin selling homes/commercial real estate. I have struggled with what to do post-bar and don't have that much legal experience. Regardless, I set up my loan repayment and got instantly angry; I am not willing to do just about anything to get this shit paid!     Go check out Dave Ramsey on Youtube. You literally are at the most important point in your life and don't even know it. PM me if you want to talk about the idea of law school, careers, and student loans.      I drove 1h to school. I would suggest getting a 40gal tub and put it in your trunk. This way you can keep all of you law school materials all in one safe spot; I swear by this. I kept everything I needed in my tub and it was perfect from 1L to the Bar Exam!      I agree. I know quite a lot about how tax law works, but your right I don't have the time to waste figuring it out. Thank you for your input.      Thanks for the honest response. I agree with you entirely, with any type of business scaling is a big part of success. I do have a lot of drive and I feel as if I'm stuck at a point right now to determine what to do. I have a handful of mentors that I have talked with on their starting story, but they are all so different with very little overlap. I know I can take bite of each and create my own, but I feel that inevitably it's just going to be a learning experience.     I know and understand this. How do you use your network when it comes time to? Do you say ""Hey I have a guy for that!"" Then because your client is already infront of you they are more inclined to seek ""your guy"" what their needs?     I thought it was a diamond. haha     I did and it did not scratch the surface of the stone.      Thank you so much! What about the one with the like rock growth inside it?     I see. That is perfect idea actually. Thank you.      That came about 6 months too late!      Oh for sure. How would you suggest networking? I was going to join the local Bar Association and a BMI Group.   Check Out My Rock Collection!  [My Rock Collection] (http://imgur.com/a/VzTft)

I have been collection for well over twenty years. My parents bought rocks to surround our house as landscaping. I have clocked thousands of hours out digging for my next find. I love rocks, and everywhere I go, I ALWAYS bring a handful of rocks with me!      No I have not done anything yet, still plotting out the business plan.      Ok perfect thank you for that site. Good idea on the sub s, I can see how that would be beneficial.      Ok, I was wondering about a few other things as well. I love real property law and I want to get my brokers license. I have a buddy who want to create a business to flip houses. Also, I was thinking about opening a property management business. I understand this will take a added level of conflict of interest and keeping the lines clear-what do you think? I focused on Business Transactions and Formation, Real Property, Bankruptcy, and Estate Planning in law school; I also have a bachelors degree in criminal justice. I just feel like I have so many areas of practice I could offer to a potential client, is that normal? or am I over-shooting?   Check out my Rock Collection, help me identify what type of rock they are!  [My Rock Collection] (http://imgur.com/a/VzTft)

I have been collection for well over twenty years. My parents bought rocks to surround our house as landscaping. I have clocked thousands of hours out digging for my next find. I love rocks, and everywhere I go, I ALWAYS bring a handful of rocks with me!      Perfect! My Wife's cousin actually just graduated with a Masters in Accounting and is obtaining his licenses now. Would it be wise to open a business with him? Me and him are super close so there wouldn't be any BS; its at the point where I could ask him and he would say yes. I think it is a smart move.      I took Themis as a commercial course to prepare for the July 2016 Bar Exam; the course was $1500. I paid out of pocket for it and it is not attached to my student loans.Therefore, I would argue that as a supplement to obtaining licensing by the state, I had to purchase it as a business expense. Check this deduction out. Basically if you create a business, there are certain exceptions that you can write off if you meet the requirements. I am going to write everything off: Costs, Telephone Plan, Printer, Supplies, etc. [Outline of Start Up Business Deductions](https://www.sba.gov/blogs/startup-cost-tax-deductions-how-write-expense-starting-your-business)     I am having the same issue. My last name is ""Cochrane"" and there is a ""Cochran Law"" in my state and their services touch my region; but, they do not practice any of the same areas as I would. Also, they are very niche in what they offer. Not sure what to name it either. Always thought of Cochrane Law, but I don't want potential clients getting confused about the ""E"" on Cochrane.      I just scanned the Attorneys near me and I am not a fan of the search system honestly. I feel as though the ""younger"" Attorneys were in the last few pages...right next to the ""Disciplined"" attorneys. I don't see the value.   Start Up Business Deductions  Basically, I am a recent graduate and just sat for the July Bar. I am gearing up to open an office in a rural/rapidly expanding area with very little competition. I am curious if anyone had written off the costs associated with sitting for the bar? I know your not permitted to write off your student loan debt, but since I would be ""starting up"" a business, I would like to write off the costs of my commercial course as part of the $50,000 start up costs. Also, is it important to know a reliable CPA? Thanks in advance.      I took Sales the term before I studied for the Bar Exam and LOVED it. I was so thankful I took it before the exam. We covered Contracts 1+2 and ran through Article 2, 3, and 4 of the UCC. I glazed over the ""Advanced Sales"" section of my bar review because it was so fresh in my mind.      The thing is...your an Engineer, your capable of putting yourself in a position you know you can work in and learn. There is always a way to fix something, it just depends on how you look at it. I have my JD, just sat for the July Bar, and I want to go back and get dual Engineering Degree. The cool thing about being an attorney, its obvious, but the more you know the more you can call your gross income. Plus, you become extremely valuable because of your education. I am 27, and even if it takes me 20 years to get all that schooling, I would be 47 with plenty of time to reap the benefits. You can do anything you want to honestly.      It Depends.      I graduated with an Engineer who went into IP. He was roughly 50-55 and had been an Engineer for wel over 20 years; he just wanted something new and that extra security that comes with the added title. That being said...do what's right for you. Your goals, finances, etc. Make sure you have everything in line. You could also find an IP firm near you and possibly work for them to get a feel for what they/job would have to offer.     Sounds like you have a claim for IIED.      I would piggyback of this. You have to want to be an Attorney, and you have to like your current position-you just want to mash them together to create a super career.      Not to be a dick, but genuinely help, sentence format and writing skills is big. Learning how to write like an Attorney is HUGE. Don't be afraid to be you and join in on some type of Moot Court or Editorial Staff to work your way up throughout law school. Don't be afraid to be wrong; so long as there is a good faith valued argument-you are generally never wrong.      I took a Federal Adminstrative Law class in Law School. I did find it interesting it was a pre-requisite for an Energy Law class I wanted to take.     Handwriting is scientifically better for memorization. I wrote all my notes out for the Bar Exam and went through 24 pens in 3 months.     I think you just sparked an interest for me...I am from Michigan and there are a few firms in my area that practice this type of law.     I did like Themis, but I will piggyback off this response to wait and make a definite conclusion.     dude id love a farm especially because all these contracting multiple choices are always about buying wheat or corn in installments lmao     dude soo lazy     I pre-ordered mine on Amazon, don't have the physical copy yet. I figured I read all the other ones growing up, might as well read this one as well; should be interesting. Haha it is better than what I have been reading the past 3.5 yrs     That new book comes out this weekend I think.     I think it really depends on what words you used, so...It depends.      Man, its just not worth it.     It is strict liability;like GG, game over son.     I just caught a Pinsur at 433 got his ass!     I'm sure he/she probably zoned out,ost their capacity, and just was having their eyes wonder.     I already have 3 new apps on my IPhone. Haha I'm back world!     It's insanity. Honestly I don't get it.     Yea. Glad that is over.     My head was down, but rumor has it, some kid got escorted out by three Proctors for cheating. He just picked his application for Starbucks up today!     HAHA, dude same thought! My wife goes to work early and I used to get up with her and start studying from 6-8pm when she got home; I had nothing to do this morning! I was lost.     That is MICHIGAN...should be interesting.      We all are, even if we say were not. Have faith you have done what needs to be done, that is all you can do at this point. Just keep refreshing on the things you feel you don't know.      Ugh..shh don't tell me that now. haha     I am at the same point. We should all take it easy, you know if you have been doing work; I just feel like I have so much in my head I can't pinpoint it.      Thank you.      I will just throw my extra ear plugs in my nose holes...next issue please. lol     Scenario 1: Person next to you blows chunks......You say nothing and just keep typing as you glance over; thinking to yourself, ""damn was that hearsay or non-hearsay, shi...oh yeah non-hearsay...""      Could that go to Common Plan as well?      MI rules state you cannot remove your laptop from your seat until all 6 hours are up.      This is a Goldmine...jeez glad I went down that rabbit hole.      Don't take this exam...ATTACK IT! Good luck to everyone.      For HS Exceptions where the Declarant is Unavailable, you have ""Admission of Party Opponent""-that is Non-HS; it should be Statement Against Interest for Unavailable.      Best advice I have heard so far: Pause, don't just jump into a question thinking it is one thing; pause. Let the facts and call filter through your brain, let your brain pick it apart. You can save a lot of time and headache if you PAUSE and FILTER what is asked of you. Also, if you don't know what is asked, just write something down; the graders cannot give you points for a blank page.      Edit: Back to studying.      Oh, dude-we totally grew up in the same era! haha     Bhahaha! Your brain needed it! It just shut down on itself and tricked your body into going to sleep to restart.      I really just want to fall asleep. I have hit a wall and it is disturbing me, badly.      I don't think they themselves understand the law...or they just don't know how to read.      Haha, bingo! That exactly where I was going in my head, even if it was worded poorly, you got it. All I would need is some Actual Implied Authority and a house in the middle of the Amazon with a nice fishin' hole near by...I would be content.      2 points for Gryffindor!      GREAT defenses! Ok, plot twist. What if the tribe formed a proper corporation and elected the tribe elders to the board of directors. Then, each member of the tribe has disposed of their interest in the AP'd land to the corporation. The Corporation's Board of Directors takes the interests in exchange for shares in the corporation. The board then gave me a quitclaim deed to hold in trust as their Trustee for the benefit of the shareholders of the Corporation. As Trustee I have sole discretion on making distributions to the shareholders of any profits made in connection to the property, and the trust also includes a spendthrift provision. What now?      This is a good trick, try and tie your interest with something they are focused on; I did this for my position. I went through the first website and basically took key taglines they used on different pages and incorporated them into my cover letter; got a call back three days after submitting it. It puts them in a frame of thought that you are not going to need coaching to jump on the bandwagon; your already on it.      Oh...well they would just throw me a quick quitclaim deed...I will throw them some banana tree seeds (""value"" in South America) and now I am a Bona Fide Purchaser for Value. Boom, I will just tack their time and seek quite title for myself. haha-now were in business!     True..true..BUT, what if it wasn't? lol WHAT IF, they forgot to write that into the legislation.      This is key! After our wedding, my wife and I woke up late to leave for the airport; literally we were SO glad we packed a few days before and were the last ones walking onto the plane! I would NOT want to feel that feeling for this thing.      Same plan, except I watch Lincoln Lawyer before I take exams. I will be thoroughly enjoying multiple slices of pizza while I read everything I have written out and/or typed.      Just find an indigenous tribe and be their ""God."" Bring a Black's Law Dictionary and teach them all the law. Assuming (and hoping) South America follows US Property Law, stake a claim for Adverse Possession over all the property they have used for the past x years (insert statutory period). Then, once you have obtained marketable title, use the land to mine for ""Jungle Gold"" and other fantastic ventures...so you can pay off your student loan debt. lmao I need to take this thing and END THIS MADNESS!      Focus on writing essays. That will help you study and bring together the law. Plus, the essay answers are a blank page if you don't will it up, where the MBE gives you the answer you just have to use some dedicated focus to deduct to the correct one. You still got time just focus on your worst topics and go from there.      I have posted this before, but I am sure it got lost on here. Here is something, if not everything you should know, for A3. You have to think of it...in order: (1) Do you have a Negotiable Instrument? (2) If you have a Neg Inst, was the Neg Inst Negotiated? Key is number (3) The party who the Note/Draft (Promissory Note/Check) was negotiated to, are they a Holder in Due Course (Bona Fide Purchaser for Value)? From there it just depends on the issue. Watch for the shelter rule, endorsement issues, good faith issues, if you want to go deeper you can learn the Real and Personal Defenses, and possibly accommodation party liability/underlying liability for the Maker/Drawer/Drawee.     Yes, the neighbor could sue the landlord to enforce the covenant. First you have to go through an analysis to see what they were suing for (Damages/Injunction), depending on that you would then go through Covenant/Equitable Servitude to see it the LL is bound. Then if LL is bound, T2 is committing waste (you could argue all 3 types, I would). Where T1 subleases to T2, there is essentially a new contract, T2 is the tenant of T1. T2 would be in privity of contract and privity of estate with T1. The LL can enforce the covenant through T1 because T1 is still in privity of contract with LL. Even if T1 assigned the lease to T2, who also assumed all the duties T1 was obligated to perform per the OG contract with LL, absent a novation in favor of T1, T1 would still be liable under the contract for T2's failure to perform the assumed obligations and the waste they committed.      Thank you. Sometimes you forget, it is easy to get swept up on the struggle, this is spot on.      Ratification.     Just read an outline for your worst in the morning, do your stuff, then read another outline before you go to bed.     I just don't want to see the first essay and be like ""FUCK should have STUDIED THAT!!""      Your gonna do find, just stop doing MBE stuff and focus on your worst essay topics. Just like with the MBE, the more you do the better you will become; you got this man.      haha..true that! Great point.     Right there with you, I can tell I am slowing down. I am really struggling on getting anything new done, and I am having trouble refining what I do know. FCUK!     Dear Themis, I am not doing 8% each day until the exam; I ""Flex-Studied.""      EXACTLY!      I bought a new computer for this exact reason. Luckily it was your power cord, I am still getting used to this new keyboard. lol     as am I. Don't think about ""peaking"" the information is in your brain somewhere. Your body will drop in all the adrenaline it has when you take the test and your going to find shit in your brain you didn't even know was there.       *Disclaimer: Not Bragging or anything, only trying to help* I go to bed at 930-10pm max. I get up at 6am and start my studying by 7. It is a mind over matter kinda of thing where your body is tricked into working longer because its light out; my dad used to do it in Alaska when they had 12hr of light/dark. It has helped me pull longer hours for the past 3 months. You have to go to bed early though, that is the key.      Thank you.      Yes, there is also a timer you can enable. There is no 20 min set, but I set mine for 10 min intervals; that way I can keep on some type of pace. I don't know how annoying it will be, but you hit that first 10 min mark you know its hustle time for the remaining 10.      14/21. For #10 where is that law? Obviously Civ Pro, but I cannot put my finger on it. I know sanctions are discretionary for improper certification.      It is an interesting issue, maybe something write about when all this bullshit is over. I mean lets just hope no one makes a Pokestop to steal children...sadly, I've heard of a case already where some thugs made one with the intent to rob people who came to it.      Yea, I guess I was worried it was going to be all on the computer like these practice essays are. I guess I should consider the time it takes to juggle the info between my notes, writing, and then going back to the fact pattern to see if I missed anything. I am like you, normally just write it in the law in the margin, and then underline the facts I will use to support it. Thanks!     Thanks, you too! We got this.     No, Michigan in East Lansing. Someone was hoping I was from NY because of my username. haha     Perfection! Thank you for that tidbit, def. eased some nerves.      Yea I typically am as well, but if I am typing do I get a hard copy of the exam? I figured the exam was on the exam software.      This is going to be fun. Do you say fuck it and just not worry about spelling? I sure they know that we would run any document we work on in reality through spellcheck...or should I just plug into the matrix now and upload Webster's and Black's Law along with all this other bullllllll...     Does anyone have a secret to taking notes for facts your going to use on your essays? Depending on the length of the essay, I am taking 4-5 mins to read it twice, to pull out what facts I want, and to organize my answer. Is that too long? Average? Not sure if there was a more sufficient way.     I know its elementary but over time Iv learn to REALLLLLY pay attention to the flow of Evidence and Contract questions. If there is someone on the stand more or less it's going to be impeachment or hearsay; then you just have to look for either the witness testifying (Hearsay) or questioning the witness (Impeachment). I still struggle with it sometimes because of all the distracting answers and facts, but this has helped me boost my score a little bit. There is a flow to it and it's easy to jump from problem to problem forgetting to stop and clear the slate before hitting a new problem.     Same boat man. Key is fill in every bubble after making the best deduction, and write bullshit even if you don't know what to write about. Just don't give up. We don't know what's coming...do we ever though? No.      I make an omelet every morning and throw 4 eggs, 2 pieces of ham, sprinkle cheese, and toss the peppers in the pan. Stir them all up for scrambled or omelet it out...boom tasty!      I was thinking the same thing. We only buy them here in MI, USA when they are $1.00 USD each! 15 for $5 is an awesome deal!     How much pot did Mr. Rodgers smoke?     I mean he has deep pockets and ya got to start somewhere...lol     Yea. 

I remember there was a State Farm case that developed these guideposts to determine whether punitive damages were excessive, the guideposts themselves were developed in an earlier BMW case: (1) degree of reprehensibility of Dfs conduct; (2) ratio b/n punitive, harm likely to result, harm that actually occurred; (3) civil/criminal penalties that could be imposed for comparable misconduct.

The reprehensibility factor is the most significant. Only the reprehensible conduct that is closely related to the plaintiffs particular harm. 
- the most important factor
- State Farm Considered: (i) whether the harm caused was physical as opposed to economic; (ii) the conduct showed an indifference to or reckless disregard to the health/safety of others; (iii) the target had financial vulnerability; (iv) actions were isolated or repeated; (v) harm resulted from intentional malice, trickery or mere accident.

...those are a snip-it of my notes. We obviously don't have all the facts, but it sounds like this guy does this quite often by the way Fieger responds to some of the questioning. Maybe they are going with the 3rd guidepost by showing that is the value of Mike's license? Shot in the dark...I'm sure there was a lot of weighing the facts to come to a number like that. 

     Oh. Sorry misread. 

I don't do PI, so all I can say is what I know from Law School. 

From what I remember civil assault and battery you get nominal damages. I would think most of this is going to be punitive damages because of his status.       I remember in the article it said the Plaintiff was seeking $10 million in damages. 

I'm sure if there is a basis for it, Morse could counter with a defamation suit, maybe, but if they have him on tape trying to coerce this lady...dude is going to want to pay and flee. 

Edit: I don't see how she can justify $10mil when she was grouped and then had the capacity to go back and eat with her friends...then go to the police and file a report...then get wired up and go tape a conversation with him and the restaurant owner. I mean I know their not claiming IIED, but it's a stretch, I'm sure it's based of his status as one of Michigan's most prominent PI attorneys.      Logistics aside...but very keen rational. Possibly, there is a mechanism within the time machine and geo-synchronize with the location the pilot desires. They would have the ability to travel through time and space, calculating the exact point in space they desire and in turn the exact time.

Both names are large in the Metro Detroit area, and from what I've heard, Fieger is known nation wide. Very interesting circumstances.      Here in Michigan you can get treble damages (x3) for Conversion, but this isn't conversion. You could file a suit in small claims court under a breach of contract principle for misrepresentation. Article 2 of the UCC would apply because they are in the business of selling goods, and therefore from purchasing the good you have a reasonable time to inspect and reject the good if it does not satisfy your reason for purchasing it under whats called the [perfect tender rule](https://www.google.com/search?q=perfect+tender+rule rlz=1C1CHZL_enUS687US687 oq=perfect+tender+rule aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.2905j0j7 sourceid=chrome ie=UTF-8). 

You could be a super dick if they won't accept your return. I would do it out of principle. 

Edit: PM me if you'd like I could help you out if you want to cost them some money.      It would be incredible to see someone stumble across Antartica. 

I'd actually really like to see North America before all the trees were chopped down and shipped over to Europe. A great forest once covered all of the North Eastern up to the Appalachians and they cut down...nearly everything...it is amazing what humans have done.      I'm sure any castle would be interesting to go and visit. Just to be a fly on the wall and listen to daily life would be interesting. Go to a Blacksmith, have them build you a fricken amazing sword...     It's long, could you trim up a little so I'm not scrolling down so much? Maybe at a few more CTA?     What castle would you specifically go to?      Absolutely. 

This was malicious on their part I can guarantee it.      What did the description of the item say? Did they market it in any way as an ""official Nintendo 64"" controller? 

That is called Misrepresentation, that is most certainly a reason for returning it, even if they have a no-return policy. That sticker placement was deliberate my friend.      I need that baby groot...like now. Haha      It depends...     Take it back...they deliberately placed the sticker over the one place that could represent a true controller.      Just sit back, watch the Battle of the Delta...NBD! Maybe the Egyptian's history survived the way they wrote it, and they secretly went over and raided villages taking captures/slaves..? Needless to say, it would be something to defiantly document for history...good work! 

""Gbekli Tepe changes everything."" Maybe you could set up a time-lapse camera at certain parts of the world, where no ancient people could find, with an unlimited amount of data storage, to just watch these places get built and thrive! Wouldn't that me something to see...     I too would search to see if Atlantis was true. Maybe go and talk to Plato himself and ask him to point me in the right direction. 

I think the Native Americans would be receptive of a time-traveler. You could provide knowledge to them, possibly warn them of the English landing...haha man that would be an interesting plot twist in North American history!     Oh, in the time machine your totally invincible...

This is your adventure so you can understand anything you want. 

I would like to have a birds eye view of those floods, that actually sounds super interesting, devastating, but super interesting. 

I think to see Yellowstone erupt at it's full super-volcano potential and just blow it's load...to witness that amount of force would be awe-inspiring. 

     Just one day, out of the blue, The Library of Alexandria winds up on its own web page...Reddit top page for sure!     That would be an epic adventure my friend. I would be completely down for a ride like that.      No, I understood what you were saying. Even just in shape, it would still be amazing to maybe sequence it's DNA to see how similar it is to modern humans. Really, to sequence any then living species to compare it's DNA would be amazing; maybe it's sequence was something completely alien to what we have today...     Whoa...you just blew my mind with that comment. Wow. Is there any evidence of such a creature?     Or...you could go back and digitize the library...     Oh, that would be interesting to watch. I'd be sitting there with you, ju ju bees in hand, just waiting!     It would be interesting to just walk the halls and poke around before and after the fall. Go check out their libraries, mints, bath houses...really compare it to what we envision today.

     I think the [Cambrian Explosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambrian_explosion) would be awesome to witness as well. It's weird to think that, "" Fossilization is a rare event, and most fossils are destroyed by erosion or metamorphism before they can be observed. Hence, the fossil record is very incomplete,"" to me this blows my mind that there could be thousands of species we will never know existed...almost like aliens once among us...this blows my mind.     I don't think they could handle that much information at once. The ancient scientists and engineers could, but not the governing bodies. 

It's pretty incredible the amount of information we learn today is far far beyond what they even had the opportunity to know.      I can understand that, but at the same time you already have by taking yourself out of the ""now"" and turning up in some other ""now,"" which in turn, even the smallest fart could change the path humanity or even the Earth could go down. 

Taking the Butterfly Effect out of the photo... 

Wouldn't it be fascinating to see what the ancients would do with such information? To see where it takes us? Would it destroy us? It would be interesting to see the effect.      That's deep man. 



     I agree, that would be some of the most interesting things ever. To be able to sit down and interview each prominent figure whom ever lived. Could you imagine picking the brain of someone who wasn't privy to today's culture. 

I've thought about going back in time to the Library of Alexandria or Rome, and just placing a few books down giving them the most current in science, math, technology...just to see the profound influence it would have on today.      I like the idea. 

I'm in the process of creating a blog as well. Go check out: 

r/lawfirm
r/lawfirmmarketing

On those subs there are a lot of good ideas for law blogs. I have a list of 200+ blog topics that I'm beginning to go through and write. I would suggest writing out a list of topics that you think are important to whom your targeting. 
     The future is history, just from a different perspective. 

The [Meiji period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiji_period#Economy) would have been a good place to sit and watch their economy take off in their own industrial revolution. It shows that if you want something bad enough, you can always find a way. 

I've often thought about my conscious and memory being stored. I think without context or proper explanation, a lot of what we store and think would be vastly misunderstood. I think that's one of life's gifts, we are able to coherently ponder our own thoughts, without bias, without explaining...you're able to just think. I don't think I would want anyone else to know my thoughts on that level.      I would love to see Rome in it's height. I can only imagine the ingenuity and knowledge it held. 

I would like to see the land where my house is situated as well. I know it was old farm land, but to see who and what it was used for would be wonderful to be able to connect on that level. 

I would like to see how civilized Mesoamerica was as well. At their peak, they were an incredibly thriving civilization. 

...I would LOVE to taste food from these times as well!     That would be so interesting. I would be so interested to try and catalog every dialect ever voiced or written down in Earths history! 

What part of the world would you go to first?      Yea, just have an employment-engagement letter ready for them to sign in blood too, right?  Time Machine: Where would you go? What would you do?  I know there are somewhat similar questions in this subs history, but I'd like to have a frank conversation with anyone who would indulge in submitting a response to this post. 

I always told myself, I'd want to see it all, but was naive and shook my head thinking, you'll never have enough *time* to *see it all*. Clearly my mind was closed off to the fact...I have a *time machine* and I would be capable of seeing it all! 

Take out the security issues, landing logistics, and step onto the Ship of Imagination. 

I'm fascinated with animals that are extinct or on the verge of going on extinct. I would start my quest with cataloging EVERY SINGLE, and I mean it, every form of life to have ever been present on this planet. I think that would be one of the most fascinating things. 

Once I completed that journey, I think I would go visit the Grand Can",0

When people started calling them racist, sexist, bigots, etc. The wouldn't stand for it at all. Do then they retaliated by being extremely anti-left and adopting racist beliefs, ones they barely any of them deep down actually believe. These people are not the most sociable people, so they would be completely willing to be attacked for it, since by then, tons of people where with them.     Holy shit, this is the best thing.

Nobody is dying for/over/in Crimea. There is other fighting in Ukraine that may or may not be supported by Putin. Most Russian people legitimately support Putin, as he increased GDP after the fall of the soviet union among other things


      They fucking made that already?     That last sentence is incredibly humorous      He's ""pulling it off"" well, when he took Crimea, it didn't become any war.

I don't think many people care about the losses, both were horrible regimes. 
The Soviet's did have many more losses, many of which has not been given out by the Russian government.
many of these casualties were due to the ""not one step back policy"" of the USSR, it was the only way the Soviets could defend against the Axis in their prime.      yes     I would recommend black ice if you want the game more complicated.

Please!     These 1st of April jokes are currently reaching a point which is ""out of hand""     This excited me, before i clicked on it. I thought it was a cold war dlc, very disappointed I am now.       wat   So I tag switched to Japan....    Well Russia, if you want to.    Why does this keep happening?       Crimea is rightful Russian land     That sounds like you sit in a room fapping all day by the way you said it.     

Do you like history? Because that's pretty much the only thing I have an interest in.

 I am an avid collector of  music by the Red Army Choir or other music preferably made by some authoritarian state.

I am also a bisexual male.

I am also a Slav (Pole, have a massive hatred for south Slavs) who doesnt know how to speak any Slavic languages but can speak German, quote ironic, huh?

I am also a gamer, although I almost exclusively play Europa universalises 4, Hearts of iron 4, Victoria 2, and eve online.

I am 100% serious, really I spent my whole childhood talking to old people, I have no idea what popular culture is anymore. 


My life is horrible.

PM if interested     Completely solo fascist America. You get to chose who you attack, only country that could possibly attack you is the Soviet Union, you get to do whatever you want while being the strongest power eventually. Don't have to fight in the pacific at all, instead to Caribbean theater, invade Germany eventually. Operation sea lion though faroe islands.       Nor Latvia, Estonia, or Lithuania. Or Finland     What's the mittleafrika story? (Other an Goring being leader)     For me Britain is so much easier to invade as than japan even as the U.S. what I do is go through north Atlantic islands except Iceland, which is normally garrisoned a ton. Get to faroe islands, build airbase and invade Scotland 
+10 points for landing in two spots, one south of the port in north Scotland, encircling any divisions defending the port (if there is any)     I too would like to know. I have yet to figure out how to do a successful purging of the untermensch     Deciplining     very  Was Napoleon ""good""  From what I have read it was that he was a dictator, but not a tyrant.

And he was mostly better than any of the other absolute monarchies in Europe at the time, he freed some peoples form their oppressors, such as Poland in the duchy of Warsaw. 
       He was improvising, somewhere there probably where Pakistanis celebrating.     Slavs      ""The world is run by the jew""     So? What does that mean? They where planning that, they never intended to just deport the untermensh.     What does the Holocaust have any thing to with deportation?     No where close.     By deporting all the immigrants, it is.     Yeah. Their's are just a bit more modern. The U.S. hasn't been working on improving them that much.     Why do you think the U.S. or the USSR attacked during the cold war?
Neither can win a war with the amount the nuclear weapons each have. Both would be decimated.     So you are pro-sjw?  shame on you.   Just ignore politics in the U.S.


Scum      Well, Russia has better ICBMs than the U.S. it wouldn't work for the U.S., it would eventually work for them, but with deaths of millions.        Fucking hell, I have work in the morning.
  Hoi3- some questions  So I just figured out the basics of this game, and I have cone to the conclusion that hoi4 is complete shit. I have a few questions about hoi3 that I couldn't figure out myself.

1. How dense should troops be? How many divisions per front line province? For a country like the USSR or Germany.

2. Should I keep reserve divisions behind the front lines if needed to reinforce?

3. What is a good army and division template?

4. As Germany, is making only a small surface fleet with large amounts of submarines a good idea?

5. Are bombers enough to gain control of the English Channel, enough for an invasion?

6. How do supplies work?


     Pheasant, real hackers use Microsoft bob     Buy hoi3 instead, its so much better, just worse graphics.     Because they have black hearts     Proof?         How did you manage Trebizond with ottomans there?      Well when  group something for that long I think they have a pretty good reason to jeep it for themselves.     Hey! North Carolina isn't very southern  Time travel       Putin is bringing good change.     Is there any more information on that? It sounds very entertaining     Otto Von Bismarck, he didn't have complete control, but close enough. He sought to unify Germany though diplomacy not war, if possible. Anytime war was needed, he wanted it to be short and relatively un-damaging. He also initially didn't support taking colonies in Africa, once the Kaiser really wanted colonies Bismarck then supported them.     Napoleon only ever declared war on Russia     I see that due to no response, I have in fact, won this argument. Another victory for the Blackshirts     Evil does not exist     How to become them?     Croatian*     you lie!     User name is a meme. Go to r/eu4, eventually you'll find it.

Who ever said I like Trump, just because I say I am a fascist doesn't mean I like him. Trump is pretty useless, that doesn't mean that im going to ""resist"" his rule like many others are trying to do. You cant possibly get him to step down by protesting, in the current situation.

Who says Fascism is always racist? Most of the time it was, since that was the whole reason they rose in the first place. Before Italy joined the axis and/or surrendered to the allies (becoming a puppet of Germany), they were much less racist than than most other countries. When they invading Ethiopia in 1935, many of the Italian soldiers felt that they were freeing the Ethiopian slaves. 
     Give me evidence of whenever Trump or Le pen is a fascist, please.
     Fascism is good. Even when you know, Le pen is not a damn fascist, nor is Trump.     Well it was the USSRs idea on weapon manufacturing.       Chess grater, as us furries call it.     Well Putin actually knows what he is doing, and mostly doing it well     Which is the best way to handle them     it works a bit     Mod link please     Thanks!     R5: Canada is 100% liberals
  An accurate depiction of Canada's current political situation       link? that sounds better than them faxing threats to South Korea     4 infantry, 5 artillery, 1 hussar. 

Later switch 1 artillery for engineer.

-------
My gym uses a barcoded card to allow its members entry, which you scan on a barcode reader to operate the turnstile. The gym is operated as part of the university, so I can use the barcode on my student card to get in. I recently lost my student card so had to get a replacement card from the uni, which I assumed would have the same barcode printed on it.

Today:
-------
I arrive at the turnstile and hold my card up. The machine beeps to signal that it read a barcode, and I push the turnstile. It's locked. I raise my card again - maybe there was an error in reading my card. BEEP. No entry. I glance over at the guy at reception, who asks if I've recently replaced my uCard. I smile with realisation and explain briefly that is replaced it a day or two ago. He tells me that since the barcode has changed, I'll need to reregister my card and it'll only take a second. 

""Fair enough,"" I think, ""such are the plights of losing your card. Come to think of it - of course they changed the barcode, so that nobody can use my lost card. What good security."" How wrong I was about that last part. I hand him my new card and he searches the system for my name (which takes about 10 seconds. I'd estimate there are maybe of the order of 1000 members of the gym. Even if it's searching the entire uni there are only 30k students and staff.)

Now comes the horror part. 

He found my id in the system by just searching for my name. He then scans my new card and does some typing. 

""Ah,"" he mutters, looking puzzled. ""You've got some symbols in your password which aren't valid password letters, so it's not letting me update your card details. I don't know how it let you save such a complex password. You can change it now if you want?""

At this point I'm a little shocked - firstly at which characters could possibly be causing this problem; secondly at how my password had been allowed to be set with invalid characters; but most agreigously how he had known that my password had special characters in it?! I must have looked puzzled, because he smiled. I asked if he could see my password, and he swivelled the screen around so that I and the two people queuing behind me could see, and pointed at a textbox labelled ""user's password"". I was flabbergasted. Not only have they stored my password in plaintext, but they've shown it on the screen and allowed the staff member to edit it only by searching for my name. My account stores my email address and credit card details, which were also available in plain text editable form on his screen. This is all on a computer frequently left unattended and easily within reach of anybody who walked through the door to reception. 

I expressed my disapproval only by a disbelieving sigh, and dictated another memorable password with no special symbols in it to him to type into the system. He overwrites my existing password with the new one I told him (remember that at this point he hadn't scanned my ID, and was allowed to edit any of my details just by searching for my name). But my replacement password turned out to be too long - the system only accepts passwords of length 15 characters or fewer. This is getting silly. I finally came up with a decent acceptable password, and was allowed entry to the facilities. God help me if they ever have a security breach. 

I'll ask for my email and credit card details to be removed as soon as I get a chance, or whatever I can do. I know it's only the local gym, but anywhere can be susceptible to data theft, either by clever hacking or by a twelve year old walking through reception and opening the unattended computer.

(I know this has been [asked before](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/2pcc4v/request_60fps_video_toggle_either_in_camera_or/), but I think it'd be a great tweak and it doesn't seem to exist)  [Request] Record a sequence of gestures/touches as a macro  It'd be cool if you could use an activator command to start a macro which simulates a series of arbitrary pre-recorded touches on the screen. For example, if I want to delete 5 emails at once, I have to swipe 5 times then tap the delete button after every swipe. I could program a macro to simulate the swipe, then the delete tap 5 times. You could also use it to scroll to the top of a long UI - rather than swipe downwards 10 times, just invoke the macro and let it simulate the swipes for you.
I'm sure you could think of loads of other uses. Why isn't this already a thing?! I think it'd be a great tweak :)  What would you get fired for if your boss/manager found out about it?

[removed]  [Meta] can we get a CSS popup over the downvote arrow to discourage downvotes?  I've noticed it a lot in this sub - people love to downvote, and it discourages posting and commenting. I'd like to see some action taken to at least tell people they're being dicks when they downvote for no good reason.

Obviously I'm not against the downvote as a concept - trolls, spam, broken rules etc do need to be downvoted. But the downvote is not a disagree button, and it is kind of disheartening when you mean well but get downvoted, as I've seen a lot during my mostly lurking. This sub just seems to be particularly aggressive for some reason. People make honest meaningless mistakes and get downvoted into oblivion for stuff that doesn't even matter. It'd be far more contstructive to explain why someone is wrong, or explain your opposing point of view, or point out that their link is broken, or something that will actually bring some learning and help people. It just feels immature to see tiny mistakes with a score of -30 or whatever. If someone asks a dumb question, they're probably new, and downvoting them is going to scare them away from becoming active in the community, and it doesn't solve anything. Maybe the answer is in the sidebar, so point them to the resources to find out for themselves so they learn for next time. Everyone is new at some point, and everyone makes mistakes.

WE DID IT, REDDIT!!!    My dad downloaded a dodgy jailbreak and now a dodgy version of Cydia is stuck on his phone. Help?  He's got an iPhone 5S running 7.1.1. He tried to download the jailbreak on his own but he doesn't really know what he's doing, and ended up with some dodgy version of cydia. Over the phone, I talked him through backing up his device to iCloud and then doing a full restore. When he completed the restore, the dodgy cydia was still there (before any of the other App Store apps started to re-download). 

After the restore, the ""cydia"" screen says 

cydia version 8.1 

if that means anything to anyone? Also,

This is a trial run of cydia for unjailbroken devices. You must jailbreak your device to get the full version

Obviously this is all bullshit, so I told him not to press anything.

I was at home a few weeks ago and had a quick look at it and it was a good imitation of Proper Cydia but it was definitely some kind of phishing scam or something. He said he didn't pay for it, but I told him never to open it. It's just a bit worrying that it persisted on the device after a full restore.

Any advice on how to remove the dodgy Cydia and whatever it might have done to the device? I'm trying to get him on 8.1 before Apple stops signing it, but I don't want to brick his phone or do anything irreversible.

His device seems not to be connecting to iTunes - it connects to his laptop, and shows up in Windows Explorer (Windows 8.1), but not in iTunes. iTunes diagnostics shows everything is fine but no iPhone detected. Not sure if that's relevant.

BREAKING edit:

We're bringing you this story LIVE from the scene folks!

He says even DFU mode doesn't allow it to connect to iTunes. He also says it's something he downloaded on the device rather than connecting to windows. When he holds an icon to make them wiggle, the cydia icon doesn't wiggle or have an x, but the rest do. He also reconfirms that he didn't pay for it.

Once I finish I will take a high quality pic, thanks for checking it out      sick dude  Before I do the background....What do you think?       It's oil paint  John Lennon painting practice, one hour       that show was amazing, watched it in kindergarten, used to trip me out     I'm finishing my sophomore year majoring in Communication arts at the best public art school in the nation which I'm sure means absolutely NOTHING in this corrupt nation....and after reading this post and everyone's comments and experiences.... its been plaguing me all day.....if people with masters all over cannot make ends meet....what hope is there for me? Esp cuz I'm an artist....should I drop the fuck out and stop wasting money and move to Australia?......move the fuck outta here....i can't get it outta my head... I still have two years but how much can happen by then....will things get even worse...? How am I going to survive......if there is any artists out there, how are you holding up?      Me too wtf      LOL that just made me geek out      Thank you :)     It's 2 feet by 3 feet      hahaha what's up springfield-  from springfield, currently in richmond though, VCU.  Sunny springfield, gonna be a long summer     Thanks this painting surprisingly punished the work I've been doing in the past few months.....its the first time my professor ever complimented me on a piece, he called it a ""breakthrough""     I tried man this was the best I got after like 3 hours ....the oil was laid so thick and it will not be dry for a while so it reflects every little light , when it dries ill take it sorry man      Haha yeah shoulda seen the riots here , it was fuckin crazy riot police helicopters throwing down tear gas people tearing down fences and destroying everything, never seen anything like it , the citys been wild ever since, it was an amazing run to watch, even after losing there was one last riot and celebration     I'm a sophomore at VCU in Richmond, Va     Yeah that's me      No I have been using the knife for two months now.... I gave up the brushes , thought I would try something new   Palette knife Oil painting I did in 8 hours.....straight       https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-bxgOjSD0Cko/TYf08ldBV5I/AAAAAAAAALE/EDKfwYSbzhY/s1600/Beach.jpg     I owe it to you guys. Here, a high quality pic of the painting....I realize that the first pic had very little color....

https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-bxgOjSD0Cko/TYf08ldBV5I/AAAAAAAAALE/EDKfwYSbzhY/s1600/Beach.jpg      Nice...better quality pic woulda been better..so it wouldn't look so faded and even toned...
Contrast in the strokes and shading would have popped it out...maybe it's just the photo but if not..try having darker areas.  IDAP of an Island on fire using Charcoal, crit welcome.       pretty nice...eh kinda , it was alright...didn't look stop motion...     Awesome, think I wanna do it.     I just realized your the same person who commented on my drawing, that's sweet. It actually feels like a community on this thing, I think I'm gonna start getting on r/art more, btw I'm about to upload part 2 of my war sequence, check it out.     you may want to consider the placement of the figure....by putting it right next to the edge like that, it feels kind of closed in and the way the figure is looking to the top right, I think it would make more sense to have more negative space on the right side vs left. What I am seeing is the negative space competing against the angle of the head, the figures gaze carries towards the tight space, but a huge chunk of space leaves us behind, on the left.      Anytime, I love to help out fellow artists...thanks for checking it out     I noticed everything seems to bleed off the sides...Maybe if you had a certain element in your work that DIDN'T bleed off, you would be able to add more interest to that element and create contrast, making it either more important, or even a focal point.....like the girl on the bottom right..the way I look at it, the giant orb/planets in the middle are overpowering the work for sure, but I still notice that there is the girl in the corner and my eye seems to follow the other few afterimages of her to the left, then it bleeds off, bleeds back on to the orbs and carries my eye to the top right. I still get a sense of a journey with that girl, so if you hadn't bled her off on the bottom right, she,which represents the journey, would have been a little more important then the destination, which is the orb transformations/rotations around the planet. Don't take it in a bad way, you don't even have to change anything, just thought i'd share what I got from this image.
     No, it is not but yes I have seen his work, my teacher showed it to me while I was working on this, thanks for the comparison.     Yeah sure, I actually started the whole thing using vine charcoal to get a medium gray tone.

 After the paper had that tone then I started adding lights and dark...I used my fingers to blend....to get the smooth areas and then used kneaded erasers to bring out the light areas. 

To bring out the darks I used charcoal pencils in basic outlines of where the darkest spot would be, and then used my fingers to blend the darkness in with the medium tone.

Its a process of working from biggest areas to smallest, don't try to render little parts at a time, or else you will feel overwhelmed.  

Try to take on the drawing as a whole, The blank sheet at first, The medium tone next, and then see if you can find certain areas of what you are that are lighter or darker, and then after determining that, I was able to find where to use the charcoal pencil(darkest darks) and kneaded erasers(whitest whites).

Hopefully it doesn't sound confusing...hard to explain, easier to show.

Might just depend on what medium you are working in....What are you using?     hehe it's ok, it's probably better you didn't know me... I got two gold keys for two of my paintings.     That's a relief, well did you ever see a kid always painting in the hallways near the cafeteria...that was me. I was the art freak of the school, heh     well....your names lolnoodles...and if you do know who I am, then you know my nicknames noodles......please tell me you didn't just make this username to follow or stalk me, I've had enough stalkers and clingers....borders on frontier?     Yeah it would be nice but I'm here til Saturday and Back to a really busy semester....but summer breaks about 6 weeks away...maybe then     hahaha yeah ain't shit to do around here, I've been sleeping for the past 4 days in the same place, everytime I get up, I'm like ""GOTTA DO SOMETHIN"", and I end up going back to sleep. The only thing people really do here is SMOKE their brains out, lol     Haha upvote for effort man.     Haha that's awesome...yeah enjoying peaceful quiet Springfield for springbreak, Lee 09'     VCU Arts 13'  Anyone else from Springfield??  Mostly everyone I know here pays no attention to the news and important events around the world...Egypt, the revolutions...protests...tragedy in Japan,etc...no one here bothers with whats going on in the world so I assumed they would never near Reddit. It's really sad. Surely there's SOMEONE in Springfield who keeps up with reddit??maybe a few people??just curious..     That's beautiful, enjoy life;]  Mushroom cloud I made in Charcoal, War sequence:Part 1 of 3.       Awesome dude...making me appreciate my walls right now..esp since its raining     your last image doesn't work....So I don't really know what your end term goal is.     Thanks.  I'm majoring in Communication arts and most likely will minor in painting, so it might take me a couple more years since im a sophomore right now. I wish i could stay in NYC for a couple days to paint....I'm not really a specific type of painter, I love painting everything, portraits to landscapes to abstract.... and I like your palette, gives the buildings a very humanly feeling...you can also add me on Deviantart but I don't go on much anymore....same username as my reddit.  So what exactly do you do with the landscapes you paint?      Thank you, I'm glad everyone liked it. I just managed to find a nice place to paint like this today in my boring town and will try in the new 2 or 3 days to have it done, for you guys at redditart!!     I will but gimme a few days...I'm on spring break and its in my room at school...as soon as I get a better pic ill reply to you again...in the mean time you can check out my other work www.noodos.blogspot.com ,there is a lot of work so you'll have to click older posts at the bottom of the page to see all.  Sorry for the disappointmenting quality of this painting.     Thanks for the artist look up, ill check em out. Yeah I'm going to try and find the painting..I have mountains of artwork in portfolios laying everywhere....its actually a pretty small painting , probably a good reason I was able to finish in time, I'm an art student and although I am not majoring in painting, I try to average about 7 a week...sadly there is not very nice  potential landscape matter where I live..I will try harder when summer is here for I will be in India..ere , right now I'm focusing on palette knife and its techniques.....but you can definitely check out all my work....www.noodos.blogspot.com      Www.noodos.blogspot.com/         there is a lot of work on there...some is very experimental. Enjoy     wow thank you, I think your comment just took my breath away for a moment. Glad people appreciate my painting=)     Yeah thanks, i agree. I used to paint from photograph and there's a huge difference, when painting from photo, it seems very robotic and you can't capture the natural essence of what your painting. When I painted this, i was not trying to merely replicate what was before me, but put my own vibe into it and not have to worry about making it perfect down to every detail.Also the colors were changing fast so i was not worried about that either. Sand was getting on the canvas and it was painted very carelessly, and I think that's where some of life really came from. I encourage all artists to paint from life, thank you for the feedback, I had been submitting art into Reddit without picking ""Art"" and wondered why no one liked my paintings, I know now. Thanks     your right I took it awhile ago with my psp camera....very noobish of me, I'll upload a high quality pic soon, I appreciate the feedback.     Yeah I used oils. Hehe I like making things creepy/chairoscuro through brush strokes  Went to the beach, and ended up painting it at sunset       sorry didn't answer your question but yes it did make a better finished product.     yes, actually I imagined it would. It led me to pour out my hunger through the knife strokes and focus on the texture of the bread and mouth-watering grape jelly. It also had an effect on time, this was done in about 2 hours. Normally I would tighten up the painting at the end and make the edges crisp, I didn't stress rendering the details because I was hungry and for once, did NOT over work the painting. thanks for the feedback  Painted this PB J sandwich with a palette knife while starving       Haha maybe I ended up making the paw too small for that type of perspective?..thanks for the feedback.     Hahaha your right, never thought of that.. I'm glad you read it as a baboon, people always mistake it as a bear, thanks for checking it out      Thanks, its funny you say you can't afford it, I just started selling my work to my friends for like 50$ a peice, Haha. I appreciate the feedback.  Painting I did to give off a sense of anger. Does it work?        Damn man I wish you luck...rest in heavenly peace.      Yea your right I almost forgot.     Amazing I'm indian living in the u.s, I watched every single day and saw terrible videos or cars running people over...people being shot...I heard the calls from people in Egypt when the internet was taken... It sends goosebumps through my body to have seen this struggle....to have witnessed such a great historic revolution. We're all lucky to be alive in such times, I'm so proud of you guys. I can only sit here in awe and respect.....people talk about things getting done, but you actually went out and DID it, and look, your struggle was seen by everyone and had a ripple effect on the surrounding nations. Let your people know.....the world is proud of you, not as seperate nations but as a race. We will ALWAYS be in this together. Take care and congratulations!!!     My phone usually fixes everything for me. Whatever, I don't have time to sit around trying to go on people over little things . Have fun   My oil painted wood sculpture...lucid dreaming        Hahahah that's really inspirational, not to mention hilarious. I understand. Cheers, I await and look forward to future comments as I post more art.     What an asshole.     Haha your right there isn't one I don't. But I guess I just meant it was pretty inspiring and I was in the zone.   Poured my soul out painting this to Nujabes""Mystline"",check it out reddit       Hahahahhahaha how did you find me     Hahaha that's funny I was actually exploring surface of many different things.  Going out of my Fuckin Mind Oil painting       3 of 3 for my cudi series request     What do you mean who?.......kid cudi?      I'm Sikh and Hell Nooooooo I have never heard such a thing.     Thanks a lot..I appreciate the criticism. I did this 2 years ago..I didn't know perspective til I got to college.     Thanks     I made it in highschool so there may be a few issues....but yeah I wanted her to be ancient.     It was actually a request from a friend. I don't plan on sell out to making paintings of crap haha.  ""Grasp"" Oil painting...one of my best...national award winner        Lol yeah I know nothing bout twilight I just needed the money      Wow awesome I should post up my better ones thanks      18""x24""  Oil painting...sold for 100$   Kristen Stewart oil painting     ""Stump Study"" oil on canvas, 24""x24""    A painting of a tree stump I created with a palette knife       Thanks! Usually I deal with brushes but am moving more and more away from technical accuracy to this energetic and alive knife work.      Funny enough, you're not the first to say that today. I remember playing it on demo disc, that game was amazing. It really does resemble the shape of his head and it's interesting to see how far the graphics have come.      Thank you! I plan on it.      oh yes! the color palette. I loved the browns and golds and actually artificually threw in the cools     Don't think twice about it, just start!
  A piece I created with a palette knife to communicate expression    ""Inside"" oil on canvas, 8""x10""    ""Inside"", oil on canvas, 8""x10""       you're sexy ;)     Yes! it's all palette knife.   I know it can be done in pastels but I love the oil just flying and dripping everywhere while the knife scrapes at the surface.      Hi! Thank you and yes i do.

www.artoframan.com and my instagram is artoframan     Thanks! people usually think I'm pissedd but it's what I look like concentrating. It was created from a mirror.   After my trip to NYC, I was inspired to create this with a palette knife    A piece I created inspired by my trip to NYC    ""City lights"" Oil on wood panel 24""x30""    ""City lights"" Oil on wood panel 24""x30""    A portrait study I created while studying painting in Florence    ""Self-portrait in Florence"" oil on linen, 16""x20""    ""Self-portrait in Florence"" oil on linen, 16""x20""       Pretty close, I'm familiar with the texture-making processes and conveying of the expression. here's the first one that inspired the current one. 
 http://i.imgur.com/cTVSDWM.jpg     Depends on the size, this is about 20""x20"" and sold for $400.   most of my popular sizes 18""x24"" - 24""x24"" sell between  $400-$700.      Oh that would be so sicc
     yeassss  A yearning feeling expressed in oil paint    ""Light on the horizon"", oil on wood panel, 24""x30""    ""Light on the horizon"", oil on wood panel, 24""x30""       It was a 20""x20"" piece and sold for $400, so around that range.       Hahahaha had a good laugh at that      Thank you ! Greatly appreciated     working on it! I have some other work to do before I start though. I'll post once I krank em out
     I think you just established my next series      Yeas I did. Thank you      Quiunky -dink      Ah I already sold it! Sorry. I do also do personal commission though     It's me but thank you!!     I have a ton, most of my work isn't like this but I'm thinking it's time to go in this direction.  Wonder if I will get banned or deleted for posting my insta or website....?     I'm sorry! It sold already but this is my second of the series and I can definitely create another.  P.M what size you'd like.     hahah Thank you     That's an amazing question. I think about it often and even have gone as far as try to avoid pain all together in my work. I feel it is not something someone would generally want hanging in their house unlike my cityscapes.   I realize now that it is the core of my work after going through some hardship and feeling the pull of expressing it. Just last week, I  have people in my life that are suffering(cancer, divorce, violence) and I am not physically involved but am on a spiritual level, in helpless pain.  I am frustrated and that is the reason for the expression, it's not only to communicate to others but also to express in a form of therapy for myself. When I create the work about pain and am IN the actual pain, there is no hesitation, no mistakes, nothing to compare the work to, it is just pure getting lost to the process and I find resolve in that. I can come to terms about certain things after finishing the work, like the pain and torment and anguish is always going to be a part of life. It is such an important part of the universal human condition and such hardships really do impact the way you perceive the world around you.  After doing this piece for myself, I was sent many messages of what the piece meant to some of my closest friends and that came as a shock. Some of them were dealing with dark histories of drug abuse or something else and it makes the piece that much more important. They said something along the lines of ""I never thought I could communicate how I felt after   *blank*   happened, but when I saw your painting, I suddenly knew what the pain visualized into"" 

Sorry I think I just ranted     hey, yes I did! :)     Yeah, I have a few friends who have seen this piece and are in love with it just because they have felt this way in some dark times, withdrawing from drugs, etc.  I think it's all relative, something ""overdramatic"" to myself might be someone's reality and it's important to remember that.       I love you all
     hey that's a really interesting idea. I might just have to take that up, I'm just so used to doing the anger ones, I never thought about the others     hey! thank you.  Yes! it's artoframan  Pain expressed on canvas using a palette knife    ""Beneath the surface"" oil on canvas, 20""x20""    ""Beneath the surface"" oil on canvas, 20""x20""       That's hilarious and would be epic. I""m thinking the pizza on the phone scene
  A strange idea I had, here's the execution in oil paint    ""The other side"", oil on canvas, 30""X40""    ""The other side"", oil on canvas, 30""x40""       Oh yeah. Those are just glares off the oil.      Blank areas? the body?  I could see that, just because of the overpowering contrast it has.      Like another piece ?     This is actually the third piece of my Samurai Jack series, I'm a little obsessed at the moment and it's hard to stop. I'm thinking Angry Red Jack next, and then the old Jack.      ""Extra THICC"" oil on canvas, 12""x12""    Laying the paint on extra THICC, Aku on canvas    ""Extra THICC"" oil on canvas, 12""x12""    Laying it on extra thicc, Aku in oil paint       yeah! I just made another actually so I'm going to put that up as well.        Me too :(     Wow awesome observation. You can almost be swayed by the strokes of the texture      Any particular image you'd like ? I do commissions too     thank you!       can't un..see.     yeaaaa. I love the themes of the current season, so damn bloody and brilliant.      Thank you! Yeah I cranked out the right one two nights ago and it felt amazing. I actually had intended to do a spiritual one but was tempted to portray raw expressive textures. So yesterday, I decided to fulfill the spiritual one and it came out nicely to compliment the anger.      Oil!! tons of oil with a palette knife.      Pm me for inquiries     yass!! of course. I've been in love with the new season with the killing and the internal conflicts     Done.....  u/mital_madness    u/thaMagicConch

http://i.imgur.com/Mb8j6hL.jpg  Introspection and Anger. Two pieces on the samurai created in the last two days    The introspection of the Samurai, oil paint    ""Inward"", oil on canvas, 12""x12""    ""Inward"" oil on canvas, 12""x12"". (Left)       Ah I'm sorry it sold this morning  but I have prints available. www.artoframan.com/print-shop     Ah I'm sorry it sold this morning  but I have prints available. www.artoframan.com/print-shop     Did this in 90 minutes. I think I'm used to oils, could never go back to acrlyics. usually I never portray this type of subject matter with the knife instead it's always environments. www.artoframan.com/places     Don't really know what you mean by wtc? Sorry I'm ignorant please explain     it's a sword
  ""Finn"" oil on canvas, 24""x24"". Happy Star Wars Day!    My most recent SW piece, Happy Star Wars day!    ""Finn"" oil on canvas, 24""x24"". Happy SW day!       yeasss!!!  I love the way the palette knife can create tons of textures with ease. I wanted to make it clean and rainy and accidently got his skin ton in the background but enjoyed that disintegration look. Like part of his spirit is in the wind and the sword had just striked. It could have been cleaner looking but I enjoyed when it's a moment captured in time, especially one of a chaotic nature. 
     yasss!!!! It's incredible. Really reminds me of Aang's internal conflicts. This however, is on a whole different level when he contemplates suicide, etc. It's so powerful with such minimalistic design choices. I think I'm doing another piece on Jack meditating, there has been a ton of those introspective moments this season. My first choice was from ep. 2 when he's hiding and his older self is yelling at him.   A piece I created last night, the samurai    The Samurai. Oil on canvas. 12""X12""    ""The Samurai"". Oil on canvas. 12""X12.    The confrontation, oil on canvas, 36""x48""    ""The confrontation"" oil on canvas, 36""x48""    A big oil painting I created about internal conflict. Palette knife       One painting session. Mostly wet on wet using liquin. You can see the first layer was very loose so I kept those for the layers in the sky and street ground but built up the warm lamp lights and darker defining structures. Thank you     Yes, the whole painting was done in palette knife. 
     ah man I didn't see it as interfering. I can just throw a layer over it to diffuse the emphasis or maybe redo it entirely  Street reflections on canvas    ""Street Reflections"", oil on canvas, Ramandip Singh, 20""x20""    ""Street Reflections"" oil on canvas, Ramandip Singh, 20""x20""    ""Warmth"". Oil on canvas. 12""X12""    ""Warmth"" oil on canvas, 12""X12""       Na, I enjoy the center for this one. Not everything is absolute. Just because it's in the center doesn't mean it's a shit composition. I don't have any other elements leading the eye around the piece to a focal point. It's essentially a ""portrait"" of the man on the boat. Simple as that.  You're assuming I don't know composition from this one piece. What if I made those choices deliberately? How do you know I don't have other pieces with good composition?        Maybe you're the one who doesn't understand composition and what it's for(not to follow obsessively, but to learn it and break rules for the sake of storytelling). But really at the end of the day, if  people like it and feel something from it, then who really cares ? I'm not mad or anything. It's kind of a cool ""debate/argument"" .   Having a great day :)     Ah I'm sorry. You see I had tagged you mistakenly with a lowercase D.  In ""David.."".  The piece sold earlier today.  You can buy a print though. www.artoframan.com  , print shop is tab under ""shop""     www.artoframan.com/shop   I'll read that after I'm done driving! wow     ah thank you. That means a lot.  If you'd like the original it's available here. www.artoframan.com/shop    if you'd like a print, hover under ""shop"" for ""print shop"" . Thank you :)     Ah me too. You know that's gotta be the hardest thing to do as an artist, at least to build that skill of not ""over-doing it"".  Sometimes I post my work in progress as I create and people will tell me at a ccertain stage to STOP and it helps to know what others see.  I've learned to not give away the whole story narratively and compositionally and it's a great payoff. :)     You're fine. I love hearing all the different takes on my work. Everything's about context I think. Yours is an interesting title and would give the piece some grounding to the narrative of this man's life. I chose ""One""  because there is so little in the painting it leaves much to the viewer's imagination to fill in the gaps. The title I chose also is the same, so little but you gotta wonder, one? and it associates with what you see without directing too much into a specific storyline like ""fishing"" or something would. Just preference you know, no hard feelings hah     hahahha!!  Man check out all the other comments, so many about that scene. My favorite movie of all time, really.      Aw Sean.     haha! My favorite movie of all time. And just maybe that scene inspired a bit of this.      I just kind of made it up in my mind, wasn't any reference. I created a certain boat painting a while back and drew influence from that. Even that though was from something I witnessed and observed.  Cool relation though.

Hey guys, thanks for the interest. The original is $100, here's my website, www.artoframan.com . If you click  ""Shop"" it will take you to my original paintings so you can buy straight through paypal and I will package and ship them.   If  you'd like a print, the drop down menu under ""shop"" says ""print shop"" where a lot more of my work is available in many print options, frames, etc.    My original shop is two weeks old so I'm still uploading all my work on there. You can get more of a taste in ""galleries"".

Thanks and let me know if you need any help. - Raman      thank you! :) I made it when I was feeling like a lonesome hermit     yo that's gotta be my favorite movie lol. Sean gets so pissed in that scene. And thanks man, that quote though, surprisingly fit well for the critique of my piece.

subject3901,"    Wenn Menschen sich fr Parteien entscheiden, machen sie sich meist entweder ber materielle Dinge (zum Beispiel zu wenig Lohn) oder bestimmte Werte (wie ein schlecht funktionierendes Schulsystem) Gedanken. Fr mich spielen Werte, die eine Gesellschaft prgen, die ausschlaggebendere Rolle.

Die Einkommens- und Wohlstandsverteilung ist also nicht gesellschaftlich prgend? So so...     Berlin  das assoziiert man mittlerweile nicht mehr nur mit hipper Grostadt und einzigartiger Geschichte, mit Nachtleben und Multikulti. Sondern vermehrt auch mit organisierter Kriminalitt, auslndischen Grofamilien und Clans, maroden Schulen, kaputtgesparter Polizei, Hausbesetzungen, misslungener Integration, Huserblocks, in die sich Post und Polizei nicht mehr trauen  ich knnte noch lange fortfahren. 

Bitte was?

Mein Grovater in seinem 700-Personen-Dorf hat vielleicht solche Assoziationen, aber ich kenne niemand in meiner Altersklasse (bin 29 und lebe seit 8 Jahren in Berlin - vorher in Bayern), der so ber Berlin denkt.     Als Frhaufsteher in Berlin kann ich das nur besttigen.

Bin ursprnglicher Bayer und allgemein sehr viel glcklicher in Berlin als in Bayern, aber in den Bereichen Pnktlichkeit und Frhaufstehen bin ich definitiv auch nach acht Jahren hier noch eher bayerisch geprgt.     Schn und gut - ich bin voll und ganz fr Space Exploration und Kolonien - aber ich pldiere dafr, dass wir unseren Konsum dieser Realitt anpassen **wenn wir soweit sind**!

Stattdessen sehen wir berall diese religise Technikglubigkeit, die so tut als mssten wir nichts an unserem Verhalten ndern weil der techniche Fortschritt ja schon alles legitimieren wird. Und fr jeden Prozentpunkt an gesteigerter Effizienz dank Forschung erhhen wir whrenddessen unseren Konsum um 5%.

Wir leben im Grunde alle mit einer massiv berzogenen Kreditkarte und gehen einfach davon aus, dass wir bald genug verdienen werden, um das alles problemlos abbezahlen zu knnen.

So geht das aber nicht!     'edgy'

Nehme an, OP machte sich Sorgen, dass er auf https://www.reddit.com/r/2edgy4me/ verwiesen wird.

Halte ich fr unntig - seine Kritik und Verzweiflung finde ich sehr nachvollziehbar und angemessen.     Absolut. Es gibt drei Anstze, unser Dasein auf der Erde nachhaltig zu machen:

1. Unseren Konsum pro Kopf massiv senken.
2. Unsere Effizienz massiv steigern.
3. Die Geburtenrate massiv senken und damit die Weltbevlkerung reduzieren.

Das idiotische ist, dass in dieser Diskussion immer wieder so getan wird, als sei das eine *entweder/oder*-Frage. Realistisch betrachtet(!!) mssen wir **alle drei** tun! Selbst im absoluten best case scenario (in realistischen Mastben) ist keiner dieser drei Anstze *im Alleingang* ausreichend, um unsere Nachhaltigkeitsprobleme zu lsen!

* Wir mssen unseren Konsum in den entwickelten Lndern senken! [#postwachstumskonomie](http://www.postwachstumsoekonomie.de/material/grundzuege/)
* Wir mssen forschen und entwickeln, wie wir effizienter in den Bereichen werden knnen, in denen wir nicht auf Konsum verzichten knnen/wollen.
* Wir mssen die Geburtenrate senken! Und dabei global denken! Deutschland und Japan sind hierbei schon ganz vorne mit dabei - das ist gut so.

Ich selbst lebe vegan, bin kinderfrei (und werde es dank Vasektomie auch bleiben) und lebe materiell auch sehr gengsam (kein Auto, nahezu keine Flugreisen, lebe in einer 2-Personen-WG, sehr geringe Ausgaben). Hoffe so zumindest meinen Teil beizutragen. Vielleicht geht alles vor die Hunde. Kann gut sein. Halte ich sogar fr wahrscheinlich. Aber ich will sagen knnen, dass ich es zumindest versucht habe.

""You can resolve to live your life with integrity. Let your credo be this: Let the lie come into the world, let it even triumph. But not through me.""

 Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn      Mir zeigt das eigentlich, dass die meisten Nachrichten eher als Unterhaltung sehen.

Absolut. Die Kommerzialisierung des gesamten Lebens und die Gehirnwsche zur durchgehenden Konsumgesellschaft haben auch die Auseinandersetzung mit gesellschaftlichen Themen selbst zur *Konsumhandlung* gemacht - mit der entsprechenden Einstellung, Erwartungshaltung und Aufmerksamkeitsspanne.

Nachrichten sind bloe Unterhaltung geworden. Und was nicht unterhaltsam ist, wird nicht beachtet.      Die Menschheit ist eklatant kaputt im Kopf.

Ich fhle mit Dir - und verzweifle stndig daran. Aber Verzweiflung bringt nichts. Zorn und Wut und Hass bringen nichts.

Tatsache ist, dass der Groteil der Menschheit sehr, sehr simpel denkt. Das war schon immer so, und wird vermutlich auch immer so bleiben.

Wirklicher Fortschritt wurde schon immer, und wird auch in Zukunft, nur von einer kleinen aber engagierten und kompetenten Minderheit gegen den Widerstand der trgen aber vergleichsweise passiven Masse durchgesetzt.

DELL XPS 15 9560 fans randomly flare up while doing super low-effort tasks like web browsing. It only started doing that since a couple of days ago.  Any idea what's wrong here? I've had it for a few weeks now and it was virtually silent for most of that time whenever I was doing just lightweight tasks. Since a couple of days or so, the fans are going off unreasonably loudly during just normal web browsing tasks - with nothing more computationally expensive running that I know of.     TLDR: Die Wirtschaft diktiert Gesetze und Kultur - nicht andersherum.     Mll am Boden kann ich auch nicht leiden - da bin ich ganz bei Dir.

Da hebe ich auch Abfall von der Strae und v.a. in Parks auf und entsorge ihn im nchstgelegenen Mlleimer.

Aber wenn's um Graffiti, Street Art und andere Formen von kreativem 'Vandalismus' ohne *echte* Schden geht, finde ich das *mit* besser als *ohne*.      Aber fr mich bedeutet Gerechtigkeit, dass auch andere (zb reiche) nicht unfair belastet werden sollen.

Und fr mich bedeutet Gerechtigkeit, dass es nicht 'unfair' ist, wenn Reiche strker belastet werden als Arme.     Ich halte sehr viel von persnlicher Freiheit - und bin berzeugt davon, dass in Deutschland die Zahl der Leute, deren persnliche Freiheit durch prekre Verhltnisse ernsthaft beeintrchtigt ist die Zahl jener deutlich bersteigt, deren persnliche Freiheit durch solidarische Verpflichtungen ernsthaft beeintrchtigt ist.     **[Uhm...](https://i.imgur.com/VMhMhwG.jpg)**

Menschen ohne Kapital sollen also 'aus Prinzip' eine Partei whlen, nach deren Philosophie Ertrge aus Kapital rentabler sein sollten als Ertrge aus Arbeit? Welches 'Prinzip' soll das sein? Prinzip Dummheit?     Ich glaube, Du nimmst den Scherz etwas zu ernst.     Ich finde das viel unterhaltsamer und sympathischer als sterile industrielle 'Sauberkeit'.

Vielleicht ist das der Grund warum ich mich (als gebrtiger Bayer) in Berlin viel wohler fhle als in Mnchen.     By all means, delete Twitter for a whole host of reasons.

I said sure, no problem... a bit later in the conversation I asked him what exactly his work as a police officer is about.

Turned out he was a **tax officer** and he didn't want us to mention his profession because he was renting out the house on the down-low and wasn't paying taxes on it.

I've been thinking to refrain from Last Week Tonight, Colbert, The Daily Show and Bill Maher since the US election last year, and becoming aware of the echo chambers people are in - and that these shows are the left's echo chambers.

His comedy special may have convinced me to give it a go and quit these shows. Which is tricky because watching them has become quite the habit for me.

I think Kubo and the Two Strings has a lot more substance than people give it credit for. I loved the film.

The grandfather is an old an cynical, bitter man who says there's nothing great about living on Earth, with humans. He has forgotten how to see the beauty in the world.

And Kubo in the end breaks through his cynicism and bitterness, and helps to connect him with the world again.

Zootopia is another fantastic animated film and one of my favourites in recent years but I'm really happy that Kubo is getting some of the recognition I think it deserves.     It's not just you having watched the original film a long time ago.

It *is* way more complex and rich than this trailers suggests the Hollywood remake to be. This here looks like all style, no substance.     Are they really making this **[little side character scene's 'twist'](https://sites.google.com/site/lis404gits/_/rsrc/1256172679533/themes-and-terms/00024.png)** into the main story for the main protagonist?

As someone who's followed the same ""Follow Your Passion!"" mantra that was given to me as a teenager/graduate and for whom this has lead to incredible stress and pain (now working on switching fields), I wish I had read this book years ago.

Also check out https://80000hours.org     I have used C4D, MODO and Maya professionally for years and I started learning Blender and Houdini last year. That statement just isn't true. Blender is different from Maya in a similar number of ways that MODO is different from Maya.

I'm going travelling on Wednesday and since my own phone camera is broken I'd like to get a Google Pixel XL to be able to take some pictures on my trip - but now it's obviously too late to order it from the Google Play Store and expect it to ship in time.

I was wondering if there's still a brick-and-mortar Google shop in Berlin that sells the Pixel XL, so I could just quickly go there tomorrow and get it?

I know Media Markt in Alexa at Alexanderplatz used to have one a year or so ago but last time I went there I don't think it was still there.     They already blew everyone away back in 2013 with their **[Stalingrad VFX reel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGA73iBDLMA)**.

Ein mnnlicher Hund ist ein Rde. Ein weiblicher Hund ist eine Hndin, keine 'Rdin'.  ""If you're a libertarian Donald Trump voter, you're the most misinformed voting class in America.""       Indeed, I posted it there first: https://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageCapitalism/comments/5wb81j/tech_and_the_fake_market_tactic_in_one_generation/      Future generations will be more savvy. Like my granddaughter. She just sent me a snapchat.

I bet she's great with 'the cyber'.     I don't hear 'crying', I hear valid criticism about lack of regulation and awareness towards those areas where these stockholder interests don't align with society at large.     It spreads whatever people want to spread on it.

Technology is merely a multiplier and enabler of human traits and behaviours.     **[Amazon has an overwhelming market share lead](http://sc.cnbcfm.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/files/2016/12/23/onlinemarket.jpg)**     That's what the author says.

These pseudo-market patterns also mask patterns of subsidy, like the fact that Ubers current operations are subsidized by investors to the tune of $2 billion per year. Thats a cost that will be immediately passed along to consumers as soon as Uber succeeds in displacing conventional taxis.

(...)

Just as Uber subsidizes fares during the phase when theyre displacing regulated taxis, Facebook subsidizes publishers ad rates during the phase when theyre displacing third-party advertising networks.     The internet has never been more centralised around Facebook, Google and Amazon as it is now.     I don't think the problem is with startups, who indeed would be harmed by regulations requiring *'millions in capital to even be able to legally run a company in the sector'*.

I do however think that companies in systemically critical market positions like Facebook, Amazon and Google could and should be regulated a lot more thoroughly against anti-competitive practices such as the ones described in the article.

However I also fully agree that decentralised blockchain-based technologies could partially help with issues like this. The crux of the problem isn't technological though, it's economic/political/social/cultural. Even the best and most decentralised protocols don't solve the problem as long as we continuously give up our freedoms (often unknowingly) for a bit more convenience and *'better user experience.'*  Tech and the Fake Market tactic       Thanks for cross-posting!

subject3944,"     I dunno. I feel like Gallade is better... Mean look, hypnosis, false swipe... Smeargle is way too weak to not get murdered by legendaries. Only advantage is really soak.      Super secret training always gave evolve stones and pp up..     Japanese only. Best bet is to wonder trade. I got mine from a forum trade.      Did no one play X/Y..?     You can breed anything... Getting it is a different story. Go into wonder trade and keep going until you get a snivy. It will probably have HA. Should take like... 10 minutes.      You could try Dusknoir or Golurk. Dusknoir is really strong with some decent options... Especially night shade (surprisingly). Golurk has such low speed it's hilarious. And can learn gyro ball...  Dusknoir could also reset trick room so your whole comp doesn't fail if Aromatisse gets KOed immediately. Trick Room Golurk would basically be handing out priority Dynamic Punches. It's incredible.     Dragon Pulse, Glare with any decent Hidden Power isn't too bad. I'm not even going to bother listing the fourth move... That which shall remain unnamed.   Neptune approves       Like Talonflame but instead of Brave Bird it's Leaf Storm     no way I'm the only one who doesn't get it     Master Contests. Don't even need to win. Just 1-3rd place. Talk to the entrance NPCs. I seriously have gotten 8-9 and I've only done master contests like 15 times.     It can't be competitive because it won't have a pentagon.      Destiny Knot will only pass down5 IVs from both parents. This means you could get that spread, but it could overlap with the pokemon holding the power item. This could cause Attack stats from both parents being passed down, the power item parent taking priority. But the chances of getting those IVs aren't too bad.      Ground*.. Plz mercy  If your city had a gym, what type would it be?  Title. My city is full of... ""Traditional southerners""... So probably Ground. Looking at you

Fail edit :(     Distant Combat     I feel like you're trying to create a theory ex nihilo      My experiences have ranged from 40-1400. I refuse to hatch more than 1400 eggs for a damn shiny Speed Boost Torchic.      Something went terribly wrong...? Or my sight just isn't what it used to be but I can't find Greninja...     Cotton Guard is broken     I really really don't like the new voice acting. Charizard in the old Pokemon (don't know the season) roared like a bear/lion... Now charizards sound like a high pitched goofy voice saying ""CHAW-CHAWZARD""...

On topic though, I think most pokemon had a cry that incorporated some part of their names; foreign or otherwise.      Yes, I do. I've passed 23,000 people so far.   Any way to ""force"" a streetpass?  My sister went to school today, got a friggen Eon Ticket, so I promptly overreacted and tried to streetpass her to get one as well... But the thing is, I'm not street passing... I tried trading with her, giving her a ""nice"", putting both DS's into sleep mode... Basically just trying to force interaction between her DS and mine... Any way to do it? Like, would I have to go out of range then back into range?    samurai jack scaramouche wallpaper [3440x1440] (xpost)       can we... *sniff* not reference the guardian  Scaramouche 21:9 wallpaper    Samurai concept, number 10554? [Hopefully with decent reasoning] pls be gentle  *Disclaimer* I am not a balance team member, nor do I consider myself to be good at this game, take everything here with like, a few grains of salt, I mostly made this thread to geek out over the idea of a badass samurai being the rival of Hanzo and Genji
-
The desire: To add a high risk, high reward tanky DPS, much like Roadhog, who can turn the tides of a battle by being a force of assertion upon the enemy team. Left to his own devices, the samurai can dish heavy damage to tanks and squishies alike, or, being a frontline shield punisher, forcing enemies to rethink their strategy. My reasoning behind this kit, is that we have Roadhog, who excels at deleting one low health enemy at a time, can retreat to get back to full health, and does his job from range, with the tools to handle himself upclose, but let's be honest, if you're not using Roadhog's hook, you're not playing him to his full potential, not even close. Then we have Winston, very similar in his role, being an annoyance, dealing chip damage to multiple enemies, then jumping out of the fray when he feels like he needs to retreat. Samurai is almost an amalgamation of these two playstyles, but the one big thing I like about him, is because he's entirely immobile, he has a reason to have the tools required to punish foes who get too close or try to fight him one on one. I know melee is hard to balance around, because it's very easy to make a melee hero either completely broken, or entirely too weak. IE Genji, the long range dash would be ludicrous if he was melee, having too much safety to fall back on, not to mention deflect as added safety. Not to mention Reinhardt's shield and charge, which makes him deceptively mobile and adds a rather fast gap closer, that can be used as an escape if needed.
-
Samurai's style of engagement also reflects the Bushido way of life (if you're into that sort of thing), going into battle being prepared to die. His jump would never be able to be used as an escape, unless he was standing in front of vertical terrain, but does allow him to dodge some damage while dishing it out himself. If you read this far I applaud you, as there's probably COUNTLESS threads made about a samurai hero.
-
I really like the idea of Genji and Hanzo facing a common, terrifying enemy, essentially forcing them to put their demons to rest. I know, cliche, but it's still a slot that's open for the imagination.


-
Truncated origin: Family was killed/troubled by Shimada clan thugs, trained his whole life to exact revenge, Genji and Hanzo are the last members of the Shimada bloodline, whatever generic blah blah, he wants to kill them. (I'm not expecting anyone to read past the title, and just downvote me and move on)
-
Melee tank/DPS, why tanky? Well, Samurais.. wore a lot of armor. Steel plating, layered like scales, over leather.
-
300 health/200 armor
-
LMB- 60 damage, ~33% faster than Reinhardt's swings (Katana), not a cleaving attack al a Genji/Rein
-
LMB- 100 damage, ~10% faster than Reinhardt's swings,
 +50% bonus damage to all shields, (Rein, Zarya, etc) (Kanobo), no overkill damage if the shield breaks. Still not a cleaving attack.
-
E- Stance Change: switches between Katana (fast attack) and Kanobo (slow, powerful, shield busting) [8 second CD]
-
Shift- Dive: Leap into the air (about the height of 3 jumps), then propel downward and very slightly forward (10 degree angle if you're keeping score) to deal damage in a small AOE, equal to the drawn weapon.
-
Q- Naginatajutsu (names pls): Draw a naginata that deals 85 damage per swing, (same speed as the katana) this weapon cleaves with its attacks, has double the reach of other weapons, and any ability key can be activated during this time to use Whirlwind, a fast sweeping ability that knocks all enemies outward from where they're located. Naginatajutsu lasts 9 seconds)
     holy crap really? why invert it?

edit: ohh, the clear side panel.. ffs. oh well, i think i can work around that. i need to rewatch the reviews and see if the inversion was the only thing i disliked about that case

edit: it's also about 20-40 mm smaller in all dimensions, and 100 mm shorter :/ didn't notice it though, i'll look into it and see if there's a noticeable difference     yeah, watched a review of it, was considering it, but thumbscrews, and if i remember correctly (watching 20 case videos within a few hours of each other can mess with your memory) the SSD chambers were kind of crappy? i think? i'll get back to you

edit: ohh yeah, i remember it was also a mid case. and you're talking about the glass one right? yeah... if i thought i could deal with a mid case, i'd probably go with that one. :/     i would like a nice amount of SSD chambers, yeah, but also i've seen some PCs that barely fit the old 990fxa gaming mobos in them, and my z170 is waaay larger than those, not to mention the current 390 i have is massive as well, and i think the gtx 1080 is even bigger, no? but that's what i'm going to next, possibly dual 1080s, not to mention room for 2 radiators is a plus for overclocking  [build help] Out of option for the perfect PC case, or am I too picky?  I've looked at:

every Corsair case. (That was full tower)
Bitfenix Aurora
Thermaltake Level 10 GT
Coolermaster Cosmos II

I was able to find the above cases with about a day's worth of research. Cannot. Find. A. Case. I. Like.

Here's what's wrong, the corsair 600q, I hate the inverted design. Is that justified or am I being paranoid?

The 760t, the top is sealed off, preventing airflow, actually I won't go into detail for every case.

vvvvv

The case I was the CLOSEST to buying was the Corsair 750D, but... the panels opened with those damn thumbscrews. THE DAMN THUMBSCREWS!!!

I'm looking for a case that's SIMPLE in appearance, (like the 600Q) preferably the doors on hinges, easy to access SSD chambers, like how Corsair has in every case, room for liquid cooling (shouldn't be a problem), adequate ventilation without sacrificing aesthetics, and it has to be full tower.

Aromatisse/amologogogogoga     Damn if only such a douchebag trying to be hilarious was able to contain himself.   Have you ever seen a Genesect in the GTS?  I try to search for it in the GTS, but nothing comes up. Is it really that rare? Victini and just about every other event legendary shows up, just not Genesect. And Mew I think. Is this intended? Or are there really just none for trade? Or can they not go through the GTS?     It looks like someone applied the filter... Called. Uh.. Cutout? And just simplified it to like... Three colors.      Gallade. It's like having a friend/body guard.     Commented on this post     Yeah. That's annoying. Like, why even put the interaction in the game.      My electric/fighting type would be some kind of mammalian creature... Perhaps simian in appearance... He could learn some punching moves. Hmmmmm. Maybe his name would be Electrifighter... Electrivire... Hmm     I like bug types... If they have a steel type attached... And mega evolve...

And are named Scizor     Clawitzer... Mantis Shrimp op

I might be biased because I use these, but I also really like Gallade and Golurk shiny... And Volcorona..     Ash sucks     Putting megathread in a title doesn't make it a megathread     Pokebank only holds 3000... Not as many slots as you think if you're a breeder.

Edit: but that's irrelevant. I don't know if other people share my view, but I like accumulating all of my trainer stats.. OH, the biggest thing, being able to rename pokemon (being the OT) I wanted to reset my X game, but I wouldnt be able to rename the pokemon I transferred from there.   Pokemon should have New Game +  You keep your Pokedex, items, and PC Pokemon, but you can't use them until you finish the epilogue... The incentive for New Game + would be the allowance of 20 more boxes (or so) for beating the game... I love playing through the game but... Collecting everything is a nightmare.

6. Does this make me look fat     I think it would be a lot more economical if you removed the pictures as well as just left in the super effective moves.      Yes. Just breed them. Unless you have a powersave program, there's no way to rename them.      -The day car man/lad to carry more than one egg at a time

-Special party slots just for eggs. If you're full when they hatch, they to to the PC.

-Remove breeding that required a held item IE Rose Incense

-Implement a system where you could give an item to the Day Care Woman so she could ""give"" that item to the Pokemon. Ex. Ditto with Destiny Knot breeding with Roserade with Rose Incense that has Modest nature, give the Day Care Woman an Everstone, and she asks which Pokemon you want her to introduce the item to, and you tell her ""Roserade"".

-Allow the swapping of Pokemon at the daycare, very much like a PC. This would allow you to put items on the Daycare Pokemon without having to take them back from the chatty Daycare Woman. 

-For god's sake can we get a mass release option?  So, hate to ask... But I'm seeking event legendaries.  I know I know, almost impossible to ask for. But I don't care about their legitimacy... I just want to collect them. I don't even use any uber tier pokemon (Talonflame?), I just hate the ""???""s in my pokedex... I don't have MUCH, but I have 6IV HA Fletchlings, Froakies, and Goletts.. And Shroomishes.      Shit I'm Trying to Breed for a Shiny: Box 1-31     I'll poop out phiones all day... Useless pokemon.      just keep them for the lottery.      5-6IV Goletts (Mixed HA) and a box of 5-6IV Froakies (Mixed HA)     No shinies or legendaries. No significant HA pokemon either. Sigh. My sister traded 45 pokemon and got a Deoxys and Virizion     yup, pretty impressive. my luck can't get much better

in case you're too lazy to look, it's like 7 boxes of sheer and utter trubbish. (not literally trubbish, just terrible)
  Man check out all these beauties I got from wonder trade       of course it takes from the game lol? but you can't make a pokemon with a pentagon, so people will just know you're a cheater and laugh     You can run Night shade and do decent damage if you make it bulky     This needs to be stickied or something jesus christ     I can give you one.     I have a shiny Luxray that I spent days hunting for in the safari... Now he just sits in his box... Ruler of his kingdom of rust.     Clawitzer. Look at it and you'll understand!      Metagross.


;^)     lol u w0t?

I don't breed many OU pokemon, but I have a full team of 5-6IV shinies.. My favorite is HA Talonflame, HA Greninja, HA Golurk, Mega Gallade, Volcarona, and either Kingdra or Gyarados... They're all high quality shinies. I have a few more I like to switch out or whatever, but just because you see a full team of shinies doesn't mean they cheated. I haven't even battled online because I hate fighting uber teams. So there's most likely a lot more people like me than you know.      What is this? I'm confused, yo     What is club nintendo?     Kalos has been my favorite. I literally can't remember a single damn thing about Sinnoh. I'm trying to replay it right now, and it's sooooo slow.       What?     were you against a machamp or Golurk?     If anyone thinks I'm bullshitting

http://imgur.com/no7FNSM     Just hatched 30 Shroomishes and 27 were female.. Sigh. Yeah, if I get another female shiny, it's yours.      Well, not for every Pokemon... Some examples I don't care about are Staraptor, Gardevoir (cross dressing OP), Greninja..  Got a shiny Shroomish, HA, 5IV 31/31/31/31/31/x... can't use it because it's female..  Sounds sexist? I know right?

But hear me out.. I'm so incredibly finicky about genders. To me, some Pokemon just ""look"" like a certain gender. For example; my Talonflame is Female.. It just reminds me of a female bird.. My Roserade? Female.. But something like Breloom.. to me has to be Male..

Am I seriously the only one who thinks this way? If I am, some help getting over it would be really appreciated.. I worked for two days getting this shiny HA Shroomish.. but I'm just sad that it's a female.. sigh..

And to add on to being honest, part of the reason I don't like the Female Pokemon is because I hate the shade of red used for the icon..     i have like 20 from the people in my secret base, when you tell them to look for stones, the most common one is everstone.     for some reason i read this as ""Mew Mystery Gift Code!""..

Now I'm just sad.     According to the games, I should choose Growlithe. But I'd rather have a Golurk or Gallade. Maybe a Magnezone.

Aren't you Gallade I didn't say orange.       Make Garchomp either jet black or sky blue     HOW IRONIC

I can trade you a HA Breloom without Bullet Seed, or a Shroomish without HA that has Bullet Seed. Want?     I could've been trading blaze Chimchars the whole time?     It all went to his tail..     Let me guess.


Shell smash     No. Shame on them. Pokemon is supposed to be highly competitive. Some people work extremely hard to get the flashiest/strongest pokemon they can. Pokegenners are fucking faggots looking for attention by stealing their mom's credit card and buying a powersave device so they can do exactly what you just described. Don't even try to be sanctimonious you sack of shit.   After 3 failure Shroomishes over 4 days, it happened.       Professional boxer ;P I was thinking of ways to get get totally rekt by fighting type.      I've thought about this. My gym would definitely be ""The Heavyweight Gym"".

Rhyperior. Breloom. Aagron. Golurk. (Since leaders usually use 4-5)     Actually, I got that Shroomish to level 50, and realized I couldn't get Bullet Seed. So I restarted with the egg move breeding.      Thanks for devaluing my 5IV Shiny Timid Protean Greninja. I hope you burn in hell.   Just hit 1000 eggs for hatching Shroomish. Still no shiny.  Masuda method and Shiny Charmed.

Suicidal? Not at all     So this is why Kadabra learns seismic toss..     X and Y were my favorite in the series. The story was unique to the color games.. The characters felt alive.. Including your character... Just. I loved it. The Friend Safari.. The Maison... Yeah.      Torchic running around without a head...     Kill yourself  I finally traded a shiny Gardevoir for a Victini  It's 6IV and Adamant, so you know it's like, generated... but still.. it happened.


i like to tell people things     this is in game? like just open up the vs recorder? man, i always thought you could upload them or something.     what?     you learned that today?


just wow.     don't do ralts for gallade.. it took me 4 shinies before i got a male shiny... so i had 3 useless female ralts because they were all adamant.. over 1600 eggs, and i got my male ralts.. (with shiny charm and masuda)  Mega Snorlax revealed       Yeah, that is true... I could see that for animalistic Pokemon like Zebstrika, Rapidash, Pyroar... I can't see Luxray like that because he always has a mane :P

I think I've figured out my problem with Breloom... Orange is my favorite color... Shiny Breloom is orange... I guess I don't like demasculating my favorite color :/   Twisted Metal - Michael Knight    RIP HOTS Forums?  error 500 everywhere, cannot do anything. i don't think it's just me because last posts were like 30 minutes ago     for a typical ""all's well"" cookie cutter build

hardened shield and spectral leech are like, split 50-50 depending on what our team needs more of,     Actually a pretty quick learner. I always had the best performance on my team while playing Leoric, even hero damage (lacking assassins much?) 

I bought Sonya and won every game with her until level 7     I'll post a replay later, these games were all quick match because I didn't want to risk losing because of my poor performance.. I wish that was the reason I lost these games though. If Leoric was so good, why do so many people say he needs to fit into a specific team comp? Someone like Sonya or Muradin seem right at home anywhere.  Leoric literally useless now?  Made the ghastly mistake of purchasing Leoric just now. $10, completely wasted. I got him to Level 5, and won a grand total of 1 game(s). He does negative damage, he might as well not even heal himself, and he has useless crowd control. In fact, his only good crowd control is hilariously situational that like 85% of heroes can just jump out of anyway. He can't clear waves worth crap, he can't fight anyone in a 1v1, he has almost no role in teamfights because of how squishy he is, soooo... Can anyone tell me I DIDN'T waste $10 on this guy?     My build is what everyone says it should be. I think Burning Light is bugged, because I don't see it procing anymore... ever.

If that's the case, then that's a good thing     I never use legendary pokemon. I was just speaking from a thematic standpoint. Victini is actually really strong though. V-Create, JESUS.      I actually hate all legendary pokemon.. To use or otherwise.

There are two exceptions to this: Rayquaza and Victini.      Why did you put that much effort into a non HA starter Torchic..     Beat me off     You played terribly and beat a girl. Grats     Don't even bother if you're not in Japan, there's basically no point in hoping for much.       yeah, i figured. i actually don't have to worry about that, i'm switching to intel stuff. but yeah i'll obviously have to reset the bios when i sell it :P  (Build help, kind of) just a quick question, are OC settings saved on the mobo or CPU?  If I had to take an educated guess, I'd say that the OC settings have nothing to do with the CPU, but here's my question:

If I remove my OCd CPU, and sell it to someone, it'll be stock when they get it right? Like, the CPU is overclocked only when it's in my motherboard?     Oh, I actually got the MOBOs mixed up. This one is a minimum of 2133, 2400 is OC. The other one I was looking at said the lowest supporter speed was 2400, which didn't require overclocking. Ha. My bad. I'm not really sure how much that matters though :P (the AMD MOBOs I've used in the past only went up to 2133 max, so these higher speed RAMs are also new to me)     yeah, i already have a H110i GTX, as the FX-8350 gets super hot when you overclock it apparently, but at 4.5GHz and 1.5v, it never gets past 34c haha.

so long as the stuff I have picked out is adequate, i'm happy. I picked this mobo in particular because I don't have to ""overclock"" to get 2400mhz RAM, and it has an LGA1151 set, or something like that. I've never even gone near intel stuff, so this is kind of new to me.     well, i'm also a certified graphic artist, take that for what you will, so having more cores for rendering etc is helpful, and while I don't like overclocking, I do like having the option... :/

so i mean, if money wasn't an issue, this is a good setup?

edit: yeah, i'm aware an i5 has slightly better single thread performance :P but i would hope an I7 is good enough to not bottleneck my GPU if I am playing a single thread game     i really don't want to overclock, hence the switch to Intel stuff ha, I might do the ""turbo"" mode on the CPU, to get it to 4.5GHz, but who knows  Would you change anything about these 3 items? (Build Help)  I literally just bought a CPU and GPU less than a month ago, the FX-8350 was not able to keep my new R9 390 at full usage, so now I'm about to shell out $600 on:

Is this good?  Minecraft asterisms, were they ever confirmed or denied? I found a few stars that resembled figures pretty well.    Anyone else have severe sponge lag?  Sooooo here's the story... I had a bad CPU, the FX-8120, and an old video card, the R9 270. I upgraded both of these things to FX-8350 and R9 390 respectively, and ever since the upgrade, sponges are taking (I kid you not) upwards of 10 seconds to absorb water. What. The. Crap. I also updated to Windows 10, this shouldn't be logically possible, I upgraded everything to relatively high spec, and minecraft is playing like crap. Anyone have any clue why? I have 8GB RAM @ 1866, not that I feel it should matter. The CPU is also overclocked to 4.6ghz. (From 3.1, my old CPU)     I got the green line to stabilize, I enabled ""unified gpu monitoring"" despite the fact I only have one video card... it only goes up to 40% though... CPU usage only goes to like 60-80% as well. But I can only think of it being a CPU bottleneck, I know the 8120 is pretty crappy.     http://www.coolermaster.com/case/full-tower/cosmos-1000/

switching slots did nothing :/     I already ran DDU prior to making this post, Radeon Settings (Crimson, whatever you want to call it) has nothing enabled to overwrite game settings, or ""improve"" performance. Raptr is uninstalled.. My performance hasn't changed since upgrading from my R9 270, just throwing that out there, and instinct would say my CPU is bottlenecking the GPU, but I need to be sure it isn't a defective GPU, or my power supply isn't actually putting out 600 watts as labeled.

Yesterday at around 10 am I had the privileged to help with my daughter's home birth. The little guy got stuck for a while and I cried when the mid wife freed him and out he popped. Cried from joy and relief. Both Mom and baby are doing fine.     Good for you, but I'll take another Grandson and the experience over gold any day. :-) Thanks!

     NICE! I learned something today, thanks. Proves one is never to old to learn.     Fucking Kilmer always causing trouble with his muddled speech.     A huckle is the handle of a coffin and to bear is to carry. So the Lunger is saying he would gladly help carry Ringo to his grave. The line makes more sense when you know old south slang.

Thanks for sharing.     A Dad isn't always the sperm donor. So... Was your Dad your Dad?     I know how that goes. I had 2 extra nipples and so does my oldest son and his 2 boys and my daughter's son has one also. My Dad didn't have any... I am not his. My second son didn't have any... He's not mine.  Was your Dad your Dad?       Yep, It is surprising how many Grandmas were ""tramps"". My maternal Grandma had her first kid at 13 years old to a carny who was in town for a week. He (my Grandpa) went back, did the ""right thing"" and they had 7 kids in all. That is why I'm here.     Started to figured it out in high school. I looked and acted like my dad's best friend and his kids, who were my best friends. The genes gave it away then I asked my last remaining Aunt on my Dad's side and my Uncle on my Mom's side after my parents had passed away. Both confirmed it. This story gets really weird if I tell the whole thing.     My Dad had this happen to him 62 years ago today... It was me. Not sure he ever knew.     My son owns a glassblowing studio in Kent, Ohio (The Missing Piece) with 6 full time torch workers. He and the other more experienced workers have helped train quite a few Glass workers in the last year and 3 of them have recently went full time in the studio. All 3 started out a few months ago knowing nothing about the art. One of the best compliments the other glass blowers will give a novice is ""You suck... Again."" Meaning you have learned the tecs and improved to a point where you can get better. So, you suck... Again. Keep going.     How big is it?

Huge stack of household items at the curb. I spy 2 desk chairs so I stop. [Two Herman Miller Aeron](http://store.hermanmiller.com/Products/Aeron-Chair) desk chairs!!! Exactly like the one linked. One was missing a castor, the other was complete. I am driving a Geo Metro so I can only kind of stuff the best one in my open trunk for the mile ride home. Immediately did a 180 for the other but it was gone when I got back. Cleaned it up, working perfectly, gave it to my full stack son that spends his life in a desk chair.

Did you leave out a couple ""nots"" in your post.... errrr... thanks?     Thanks u/guy_guyerson for the info. This is more the long term travel I'm looking at doing. Great info for me.

Edit#1, Thanks for the replies and good info, folks. This is a little scary for an old guy who has never traveled like this and your input is helping.

Edit #2, Wow, nice! You folks real are good people. Maybe a little more info about my situation may make this even more helpful for someone else like me just starting out on this sort of adventure/quest. So, I just started receiving Social Security of $1008 a month, that is all I have to live on for the rest of my time if I stop working and a big part on my travel is I figure I can have a better quality of life for that amount somewhere other that the USA.

Stimulating the scalp causes increased blood flow to the head. Increased blood flow to the head means increased blood flow to the sinuses. Increased blood flow to the sinuses means enlarged blood vessels stimulate the nerves of said sinuses. Stimulated nerves in a sensitive person's sinuses is cause for a few good sneezes.     There are no naturally gray hairs. There are colored hairs and there are white hairs that are translucent. The colored hairs showing through the white hairs giving the over all look of gray. The whitening of hair is a sign of a lack of nutritional absorption. As we age most of us lose the ability to absorb certain vitamins and other nutrients. When our bodies are in short supply because of age or sickness of these it takes from the hair causing it to loose color. This is why I started graying at 17 and others never gray.

My question is (and it is self serving) are you ready to do it again with custom home brew kits for the home craft-brewing crowd?

If a dryer isn't available just loosely put everything (luggage and all), that can survive that temperature, into some black plastic trash bags and place them in the sun for a few hours until the heat can permeate everything. Anything that you can't treat with heat just clean the best you can with what you can. Remember, bed bugs like to hide in the folds of clothes, beds, and such so as a preventive think about treating your backpack or other luggage with Diatomaceous earth leaving a tiny amount in the folds, hems and corners to help kill any further infestations. As for the itch and rash, it is an allergic/histamine reaction to the insects saliva, so take an anti-histamine or an allergy med and enjoy your travels as much as you can. Tell the Hostel about the problem so they can get ahead of the bugs and not complicate other peoples days.

I have you folks, a dream, a link, some $$ and a Fiverr account, lets do a step by step and see if I can make any money by having Fiverr do all the work they can, from article writing to landing page to back links and such. I belong to a private affiliate network in a nice niche. I am going to work with a well known niche brand's new product line that the store I'm working with carries. The line I will be promoting only has 3 products (flavors) which were just released this week.

I figure that my first purchase will be a nice size article or 2 to have when I purchase the landing page.
I hope to do all that is needed for around $200 but we will see.

What else do you think I should be doing?

You folk's feed back on this will be the backbone of this experiment.
I will post all results win or lose.  Long term travelers, what luggage do you travel with?  I am sure this has been covered before but I don't have luck with Reddit search so sorry. Long term Latin America travel where stays in more than one place may be weeks or longer, Backpack, suit case, what? Size? Not sure how I will be getting from one place to another. Looking forward to you folks actual experiences with this.     You are correct sir.     AND, my oldest boy once ran a music store and hired and fired one of his best friends, it also blew over because the friend was in the wrong and knew it.     My son fire my other son, his older bro by 6 years, and it eventually blew over. People know when they are in the wrong and if you make solid moves for the right reasons they will get over it and if they don't they aren't very intelligent to start out.     Why not just ask Reddit how to fix your oven?     Are you the band leader? If so fire his ass and hire another guitarist.
If you have to sit down and discuss it with the other band members quit the band and become a band leader. The band is not going to make it as a ""band democracy"". I gave my son this advice when there was a riff in the band he was in, (his brother and a long time friend was in the band at the time) hire your musicians, be the owner of the band, control it. He took my advice and after the dust settled he hired some band members and started touring, to this day he's making damn good money, 6 figures some years. 16 years later, he's 36 now and married, and still tours.     I'm 62 and starting this year. Wish I would have started at 27.     I've been told I'm an old cool guy more than once (even though I don't feel cool anymore) so maybe I have that going for me. I have friends of all ages from their 90s to early 20s. I get along with all of them. I'm very non-judgmental which seems to allow people just to ""be"" and they like that. I've had old ladies in their 80s and 90s tell me about their sexcapades when they were young and I've had 20 somethings cry on my shoulder about their failures in life (if they only knew what was ahead) and all sorts of tales from all ages in between. If I'm not, I believe I can fake the ""old cool guy"". Thanks for responding.      Thanks     Yeah fuck yeah.     If I can help you achieve that just let me know what I can do.     Being American and with the current events happening I think I'd like to go to Cuba.

I refuse to become numb.     Thanks , but I don't really think it's amazing. It's not as hard as I or most people believe. You just have to be willing to roll with the punches.     Thanks I'll try. 3 months is a long time to go without any fun.     Thanks and I can already see you may win $5     Edit 1: Now remember this is my first time to solo travel I've never traveled much before. My flight arrived here on January 1st. My rides car broke down halfway to Santa Ana and I had to stand along the highway for a couple hours and get in another vehicle with somebody else but all went well I'm the end. Just took a long time to get to Santa Ana. On the second I was offered a free ride around with a young Canadian couple to some of the Mayan ruins and crater lake . Had a wonderful time. Days there and four I was asked to accompany a older German couple on their motor tour because their driver spoke poor English and wasn't confident. I didn't have much choice of where I was going but I got to go a lot of places for free. The German couple even insisted on buying my meals. So far I've only met new friends. If you knew what kind of deal I made to stay here in Santa Ana you'd like it.     [caption](http://imgur.com/d4AQsNQ.jpg) at the end of my third day here I was driven up into the mountains to casa Alaska for a cup of coffee this was my view. The coffee was good too.     It's my way of proving to my friends back home that I am actually here. And if I tried to get my big head into a picture with my huge head of white hair that is all you will see.     Looking forward to it keep in touch.     Pupusas was my first meal! Plantains were served with my first breakfast.     Yes I can guarantee it is me.     A lot of places I've been have had pistol grip shotgun guards at the doors and occasionally I have seen armed military running the street but never felt threatened never have seen any problems. I also ran into a female Ozzy who could not have weighed 100 pounds who has been backpacking here and Central America for 3 years and she said she has never ran into any problems. She started when she was 19 and she's 23 now.  Well I made it. 62 year old man in Santa Ana El Salvador with a backpack    Jan 1st to El Salvador and Guatemala for 3 months. You folks helped a first timer take the plunge.  I [M] get on the plane Jan 1st at 6am for my very first extended travel experience at 62 years old. I land in El Salvador and will be picked up by the Villa Napoli B B, I arranged to stay at in Santa Ana with them. I made a deal to help out around the place for a very nice discount and the use of extra amenities. I will use this as a jumping off site. I will catch a bus on Jan 2 to go to Xela, Guatemala to work in a hostel there for a couple weeks or more then back to Santa Ana to spend some time there. Then Who knows???? The freedom adventure begins. If anyone wants to hang out or meet up I'll buy you a few beers and maybe feed ya a meal. I leave Central America on March 30, well, that's the plan so far.
Thanks to all of you.     I love those creamy, orange, frozen little bitches!  I don't care when or who with so how do I find cheap flights?

[removed]     At 63 yrs old I have came to the times of one last chance and/or one last time and I have no way of knowing while it is happening.     What I would do first in this situation is go to the hotel management and explain the what is going on and see if you could volunteer work in exchange for a place to stay. Since you are an artist they may exchange a room for a mural or something but be willing to clean shit up if it keeps a roof over your head for a while.     BTW, How does it happen? If you think an opportunity is happening, just go with it.     Recently retired straight, very average looking M/63 hairstylist of 32 years. I have so many I don't even tell the stories because I wouldn't believe someone telling me so many. From the lesbian at a party on the coat bed with people coming in setting and talking to us, to the demure hot as hell clerk in the center of an open woman's clothing store, to local gym's head aerobic instructor. How about dropping something off a client's house she had left behind at my salon and ending up going at it in the open doorway with my car running in the driveway and her son in the next room? Or the time with the hot 20 year younger 110 lb blond twin on my lap in a Geo Storm at 55 mph at night on winding road. I mention she was a twin because... yep TWINS! Stripper? Been there more than once. In the tanning room in my busy salon, couple times, one time was with the other twin. Waking up in the middle of the night wondering who the woman was undressing in my dark bedroom... several times with different women. I could go on but like I said, I would stop believing you if you told me so many.

Newman     63 yr old male here, just got back from the first extended travel of my life 5 weeks ago, 3 months in Santa Ana, El Salvador. When asked how my vacation was I answer ""It was just another place where ""I"" lived."" Discovered that if ""I"" don't have the energy to change what I don't like where ""I"" live, ""I"" won't change where ""I"" don't.     I have a problem with Katy. On a scale of 10 I would rate her a 9.5 for good looks. BUT, I find nothing sexy about her. She just does not exude any sexuality.     My oldest son (43 years old now) made up ""conflunked"" around 6 years old. Whole family adopted it. All went well until he got in trouble for arguing with his teacher over it not being a real word that he used in an assignment in the 5th grade. We had never thought to tell him it wasn't a ""real"" word... because it was in our world. The meaning??? I think it is quite obvious. You tell me.  Who Pooped out side???       Thank you, yes it is.     Thank you, thank you, I'm here every night through the rest of the week. And folks remember to tip your bartenders.     Sorry hugefish I thought you were dicking around. I'm not on vacation I'm living for three months in another country. I live like the locals who get by on lesson 750 a month. type travel into the search bar up there. You'll find subreddits with people budgeting $20 or less a day and traveling the world. Then there are sites like workaway .info where people will give you three meals and a bed to come and help them out so it can be free other than getting there.. If you're interested go check out a few other subreddits come on back and ask questions. As far as how do I live at home? I got a cheap place 525 a month I take in a roommate. I got a piece of shit car that I bought for $1000 on Craigslist and I have shit insurance on it 38 dollars a month. Keep the lights down low the electricity bill cheap buy most of my stuff at Goodwill. Took a part time job I don't need. Don't cash paychecks until the company start bitching that I'm holding too many. Use that money to travel.     I don't buy no bling shit.     Yes, I usually over use them, I'm doing this on a phone, but fuck you very much.  What I did to not go over budget while I'm here.  I set my daily budget at $25 usd for shelter and food while I'm out here. But just before I left for my trip I got a little nervous about being my age (62m) and just stepping off a plane with nowhere to stay and no one I know. So I made a reservation through AirB B at a very nice here in Santa Ana. While talking to my host Rosy, I explained that I was staying at least a month maybe more and I would go stir crazy just setting around doing tourist stuff and is there any things I could do to help out around the place while I am here. Turns out she is over whelmed and would love me to be her assistant during my stay but she is booked for the first 18 days and would I mind staying at her friends B B which he is just trying to start up. The cost still came out to $16.50 a day for room and breakfast so that really cut into my budget leaving $7.50 for both of my other meals per day. That can easily be done here but hey... I'm a fat guy. After a few days at Rosy's friend's b b I realized this fellow and his two sons were struggling some so I suggested we go to the super market and I would buy some groceries and if his house keeper would fix them we could all share. This was deemed a good idea by all. So, I filled up a cart with mostly native foods (had to buy so Oreos) and it came to $81. It works out to over 10 days within my budget but I have been told that it may be a few more that that and remember I am feeding four people. I now eat my meals in their humble home and am treated like family, no more eating alone on the veranda. And if it comes out to a little bit more than that, I don't care... I'm family. I'll make it up somewhere else.     You are correct it is in Central America just south of Guatemala on the west coast.     Okay , yes I have three grown children who within the last five years have become comfortable and happy with their lives so I don't worry about them too much. I rent my home off of my older son who lives next door and even though its small I have moved into one room and take in roommates to reduce the cost. I took a low level low responsibility position in my son store that I helped him start and with Social Security starting last April it covered almost all my expenses and I was able to save almost all of my $10 an hour paychecks . Since the position was low level it was easy for me to take a three month sabbatical with the promise of my job when I come back. As for as my dog and cat there was a man in his forties at work who is trying to get back on his feet after a couple DUI's so I asked him to live in my place and take care of my animals until I return. I even asked him as a favor to me since he has just gotten his license back to drive my car for me while I'm gone . But the biggest thing that helped me prepare for this was becoming homeless in 05 and 06 and learning exactly how little I need in my life. I set travel as a priority in my life and everything else became secondary. I drive junk for cars I shop at Goodwill and I take in roommates to reduce my cost of living. I do not live  to impress others with the things I have.
I hope that answers some of your questions
 And as for the ""what ifs""... I have to trust in others. Stuff is going to happen at home if I am there or not. I'll deal with it when and how I can.      You may be right. But... Then again...     I'm still in the idea/development stage. I do have a site being built at this time.     You had my interest, now you have my attention.
PM me please.     Both, customers can build their own and my site or others will be able to have kits built for them. Say, if you have your own recipe you can pay a small membership and post your recipe on the site. If someone buys a kit of your recipe you get a small cut.       I agree. Thanks for the input.     It is going to be hard to under cut me. I buy from the largest wholesale supplier of these ingredients in the country and since they are right down the street from me I have no shipping costs or warehousing costs. I pick up 5 days a week.     No, sorry.     No sweatshop route here. Believe in paying a livable wage. It' not illegal or potentially unprofitable, it just hasn't been done yet that I can find.     Nope not affiliate marketing. Something different. Thanks for the well wishes.     A full stacker is what I'm looking for. Not so much the site being complicated but it will need to be able to pull ingredients from a spread sheet and put the recipes together. PM me.     Why pick this guy? Tell me what you think. And yes you can have some stickers if we ever feel the need to get any.     Nope, not cupcakes or anything baked or anything weed related. I understand the ROI of marketing, I've spent and seen spent 10s of thousands of dollar on it and understand how low it can be. This product lends itself to others marketing for a cut.     Nope, not yet. Maybe after November.     Yes there is a way to PM me. Impress me and figure it out.     I don't believe you understand the time and dedication it takes to build this sort of online business. I have been part of it before. You wouldn't have time for college with the many fires you have to put out daily. Thanks for the reply but stay with your studies and maybe get back to me when your finished.     I've been worse but I'm in a pretty good state of mind at this time. Thanks for asking.     Yes the site is ""buildable"". You are correct concerning the up keep and and such. Also the advertising if possible. I will handle the physical end of getting the kits put together and shipped.     Thanks for the help. I hope the right one or ones show up.     Would be great to get a youngin' in on this but how do I know a good one when they are in front of me? In the past it was my son and me, but he is making a good living and a free life from the store we built and doesn't want more work or need mor",0
